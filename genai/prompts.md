# Prompt experiments – Steam review generation

## Prompt 1 – Naive prompt (positive)

**Prompt:**
Write a positive Steam review for the game Elden Ring.

**Generated review:**

Elden Ring is a masterpiece that rewards curiosity, patience, and courage.
From the moment you step into the Lands Between, the sense of freedom is unmatched. The open world isn’t just big—it’s meaningful. Every ruin on the horizon, every strange landmark, every side path feels like an invitation to discover something unforgettable. Exploration is constantly rewarded, whether with hidden bosses, breathtaking vistas, or lore fragments that slowly piece together a rich and mysterious world.
The combat is deep, demanding, and incredibly satisfying. It builds on FromSoftware’s signature Souls-style gameplay while giving players more flexibility than ever—stealth, magic, summons, mounted combat—there’s room to craft your own playstyle. Boss fights are intense and memorable, striking a perfect balance between challenge and fairness.
Artistically, the game is stunning. The environments, enemy designs, and music create an atmosphere that’s both epic and haunting. The lore, shaped with George R. R. Martin’s influence, is subtle yet compelling, encouraging you to engage with the world beyond simple objectives.
Elden Ring doesn’t hold your hand—and that’s exactly why it’s so rewarding. It trusts the player, respects their intelligence, and delivers one of the most immersive RPG experiences in years.
An absolute must-play for anyone who loves exploration, challenge, and truly great game design. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Elden Ring hooked me way more than I expected. The first big positive is the sense of exploration: the world feels huge and mysterious, and wandering off the main path constantly leads to cool surprises without the game holding your hand. The second positive is the combat, which is tough but fair, letting you experiment with different builds and playstyles until something finally clicks and feels incredibly rewarding.

That said, it’s not perfect. My main negative is the technical performance on PC, with occasional stutters that can break immersion, especially during intense moments.

Overall, despite that issue, the game kept pulling me back for “just one more try,” and that feeling alone made the experience totally worth it.

**Comment:**
- More realistic and user-like
- Includes a concrete negative point
- Less generic than the naive prompt
- Clearly structured while remaining natural

I really wanted to love this game, but it didn’t fully click for me. The world itself is impressive and atmospheric, and exploring it can feel genuinely rewarding when you stumble onto something cool on your own — that sense of scale is the one thing I consistently enjoyed.

That said, the difficulty balance often feels more frustrating than satisfying. A lot of encounters seem tuned to punish experimentation, which can make progress feel like banging your head against a wall instead of learning naturally. On top of that, the PC performance is rough at times, with stutters and frame drops that seriously hurt immersion during fights.

Overall, there’s something special here, but the frustration and technical issues kept me from having as much fun as I hoped.

**Comment:**
- Clearly negative overall sentiment
- Includes a credible positive aspect, making the review more realistic
- Tone and structure strongly resemble real Steam user reviews
- Demonstrates that prompt constraints guide content without changing the model
