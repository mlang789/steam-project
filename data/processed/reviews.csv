570,True,"I've been playing Dota 2 for 12 years now, off and on throughout my life it is one of the few constants. In high school, my friends and I spent many nights playing when there was only one courier. In college I played once or twice a year on my rented laptop from school. During the pandemic It was a way for my brothers and I to connect when we couldn't actually visit each other. It holds a great place in my life.

[h3]The Good[/h3]
- Gameplay is dynamic, engaging and rewarding once you get the hang of it. There are so many moving parts that when you make your first big play, there is very little that can match the feeling of satisfaction when played just right. 
- Flourishing Pro Scene: If you want to get better there are countless new and old pro players that stream or release content on Youtube to help you improve, and often times Discord chats to find players to play with.
- Semi Consistent Updates: They just released one of the biggest updates the game has seen since Talents were released in 2016, or neutral items were released in 2019, or when they DOUBLED the size of the map in 2022. Valve isn't afraid to experiment with this game, and while you can get stuck on a single patch for a long time, you can always know that Valve Devs are working on something truly different to add.

[h3]Negatives[/h3]
- Mental Health: This is a team game. I love it for that, but playing with others can be frustrating and demoralizing. You can also find yourself ""chain queuing"" which after multiple losses can really effect your mood outside the game. My girlfriend and I have a rule that I cant start a game after 10pm because if i lose badly sometimes I will be too angry to fall asleep or talk before bed. You have to find these ways to look inward yourself, and without barriers it can really negatively impact you.
- The Community: I said it a bit above, but if you're new to online games there is so much racism, sexism, anger etc. I've met really great people playing dota, but the brain tends to remember the bad eggs. Remember there is a mute button.
- Communication from Valve: There can be crickets from valve sometimes. They ARE working on stuff, but if you read reddit to much you can get a bit riled for no reason.

570,True,"Ah, Dota 2, the game where toxicity flows like a never-ending river and the community is as welcoming as a pack of hungry wolves. Strap in, folks, because this rollercoaster of emotional distress is about to make you question your life choices.

Let's start with the community, shall we? A lovely bunch, really, if your idea of lovely involves getting flamed for daring to pick a hero someone else wanted. And don't even get me started on the joy of encountering smurfs who stomp around like they own the place, leaving a trail of shattered dreams in their wake.

But wait, there's more! Ever wanted to experience the thrill of spending an hour in a match, only to have your hopes dashed by a single misstep? Congratulations, Dota 2 has got you covered. And let's not forget the joy of watching your teammates rage quit faster than you can say ""GG.""

And don't even think about trying to improve. Sure, you could watch tutorials, read guides, and practice till your fingers bleed, but why bother when you can just blame your losses on everyone else? It's the Dota 2 way!

But overall, despite the salt mines and the occasional dumpster fire of a match, I would still recommend this game. Because beneath all the toxicity lies a surprisingly addictive experience that somehow keeps you coming back for more punishment. So, if you're ready to dive headfirst into a cesspool of salt, frustration, and occasional glimpses of actual gameplay, welcome to Dota 2.

This game is pure unadulterated dog shit, it's a terrible new player experience, coated with an over-abundance of gimmicky abilities and crowd control. It's like if you let a group of 12 year old's develop a competitive MOBA title.

The extreme level of different abilities and vast power-spikes can turn a fun and engaging early game experience into a god awful immune to literally everything Slark one-shotting your entire team EVEN if they're fed.

DOTA just simply does not hold up with the level of competitive integrity that other similar titles offer. The overpowered, overloaded, over-the-top skills quickly get old as you're constantly left scratching your head after the 5th team of people that all speak different languages after waiting 40 minutes to finally get a good match where someone doesn't abandon and waste all your time.

The game is not salvageable it will die. Inevitably. In the very least at least some small places in the world will keep the player count around 200k~ for a while, though once all the old folks get tired of it.. That's it.

570,True,"Left LoL after finding this game around 1 year into playing league with friends in highschool(about 2014). I loved Dota right off the bat, the first thing that stuck out to me was that nothing except cosmetics can be bought or unlocked.

My League friends unfortunately never got it. I had to keep playing League with them, they refused to give the game more than a few hours each. Crushed me, still bitter about that to this day.

My love for Dota turned into a total obsession. I learned as much as I could, and played whenever I had the time. I was so inspired by Fear and Dendi's stories in Free to Play, I wanted to go the distance myself. I saw Dota as the one path for me to turn my boundless enthusiasm for strategy games into freedom from jobs I didn't love and a place I didn't want to live. The one rope I could use to pull upward into the future I wanted for myself. Of course, I decided to become a professional Dota player. 

This wasn't meant to be.

I was working as a busboy at the time and would work my shift and come home at night and play, then work again without any significant breaks. I would go 24-48hrs without sleep regularly to play as much Dota as I could without missing any work. Went to 1 LAN and placed 2nd, that was one of my favorite experiences in my life. Also met people from all over the world and learned words(mostly curses heh) from languages I would have otherwise never encountered, got to practice my Spanish a bit too. I grew so much as a person from the interactions I had in Dota. It shaped me.

Despite my extreme(and overzealous and counterproductive in retrospect) dedication I never got above 3.6k MMR. What happened instead was that I ended up in the mental hospital from playing between 5 and 22 ranked matches a day and not sleeping on top of working my full time job bussing tables(which I worked as hard as I could at as well). When I got to the hospital I was 135lbs(I am 5'11"") and hadn't eaten or slept for 6 days, and was in full blown manic psychosis. Maybe if I had been provided for and fully supported during this time(and born without bipolar disorder) by my parents, I could have done it. We'll never know, but that's what happened. What I did was the epitome of the adage: ""burning the candle from both ends"". I flew too close to the sun and crashed and burned in the flames of psychosis and malnutrition. 

It's been almost 6 years since that episode of mania. Don't worry guys, I'm fine now, I sleep and eat every single day and have never had a recurrence of mania. I use medication to stabilize my mood whenever that pattern fails. Although I still enjoy the game a lot, I really only play turbo on and off since that's what I have time for. Gone are the dreams.

I know I spent a lot of time on this game, and I will regret somewhat my failure to become pro for the rest of my life. At one point it was everything to me. I lived, breathed, and dreamed it. That said, I look back on all that time with nostalgia and fondness. This is a game that will one way or another leave an impression on the rest of your life. You will either give up at less than 50 hours, or you will never forget it. 

How can I not recommend that?
It's a masterpiece.

Wait...

i just said teamwork?

No f ng way, This game have terrible Community,toxic Community,its just bad,really bad, more than horse dog or bull Sh*t, I Play in SEA Server. it just the the worst server, its like Place of Cr4p. The people dont have attitude,Blame Support,Blame Carry,Blame Everyone. Missused Report System, never give a chance for newbie. Feeding to enemy, Ruins ur Friend Gameplay. Chat full of Sh*t. just What the f? 

i said Missused Report, For Example, I have experience when playing this game, Select the hero. the game start, Waiting for other people loading or join the session. someone just take long time for loading, and then the people says ""report Report that nub loading,report"" WHAT THE??? U REPORTED someone cuz he/she have long loading at Start of the game?.  U ALD REPORT PEOPLE CUZ LOADING??? R U F KIDDING ME? THAT LOADING IS HIS/HER FAULT??? PURPOSE OF REPORT SYSTEM IF UR TEAMATES ARE TOXIC! FOR EXAMPLE: Feeding to enemy, use bad words much. and maybe you need tolerance to people who  cant play the hero propely. Teach him/her, RESPECT! dont blame,or report or other bullsh*t. ALL U NEED IS RESPECT! RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE!

U cant avoid Bullying here,The community just cancer,cant Cure. If u Strong enough,u can play this game,be a good people,dont be toxic. I never recommend this game cuz its community, I know there's good poeple there,if u LUCKY!. I prefer play with bots even the bots are stupid. or play with ur friend,dont ever try Public.

570,False,"Dear DOTA devs. Do you ever play YOUR OWN game? I guess not. Please tell me this:
How is it FAIR that you play a match, you get teamed with some idiots, and they can just report you for whatever reason like example ""You don't speak russian"". They are 3-4 friends and they decide to report you because they don't like you for not being russian. You reach a certain amount of reports against you and you are banned from all type of gameplay except Single Draw or whatever it's called. You can't even do some of the tutorial matches! So basically If i was to get together with 3 of my friends and just keep reporting everyone we play with we can just fuck them all over for laughs. How is this fair? I think you should work on your reporting system. 

Another point:
As a new player, 34 hours of gaming clocked by steam and 10+ hours of that was waiting for a match, like last night i waited 4 hours+ because i'm being put into low priority single draw matches for some asshats reporting me for not speaking russian. So as a new player WHY am i put against players with 1900 and 2400 hours+? How am i suppose to fight against them? You people REALLY need to get your head screwed on right.

The new patch I thought is a great way to freshen the game.  I hope they do radical changes like this every year to keep people into the game.   I see quite a few negative reviews.  Anyone who wants no change but is willing to play for 30 years can go back and play the WC3 with the mod, that thing is frozen in time forever.

570,False,"The game itself is good—there’s definitely fun to be had—but like anything, it’s not perfect. I’ve seen firsthand that it can be hacked using well-known programs like Umbrella,Melonity and Hake.me. That really hurts the experience, especially in competitive play.

The reporting system also feels very frustrating. It seems that players can report you simply because they don’t like you or because you didn’t play the way they wanted. There doesn’t seem to be much review or fairness in how those reports are handled.

Matchmaking is another issue. It allows brand-new accounts, even ones using cheats, to be quickly matched with high-level players. That’s not only unfair but also ruins the balance. For example, I recently had 5 losses and only 2 wins in matches that felt extremely one-sided.

Right now, the game feels like it’s balanced somewhere between “complete chaos” and “genuine fun.” I really hope these issues are taken seriously and improved over time, because the core gameplay has potential.

570,True,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy the Formuoli",1487995332,420.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

570,True,"Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.

If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.

Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.

Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.

The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.

At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.

There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.

Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.

As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.

Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.

It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway ""secret"" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.

While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.

The original Dota was an unexpectedly powerful blend of clashing genres and disparate elements that ended up taking over the world, and Valve's successor retains the original rules and characters while adding in a cheery free-to-play model and slick production values. The experience of playing Dota changes day by day--some evenings will be exhilarating, while others will kick your morale to the curb--but there are few games as worthy of your time investment as this. Those who choose to commit to Dota 2 will find many happy hours within this immaculate update.

570,True,"Dota 2 is probably the best online game I've ever played. I've been playing Dota 1, both online and offline, and it took some time before I tried Dota 2. But when I tried Dota 2, I immediately decided to stick with the game.

For Dota 1 players, you will find transitioning from Dota 1 to Dota 2 quite easy since Dota 2 is very much like Dota 1 although significantly improved. The game is as exciting as Dota 1 since players will have to use their wits and skills to beat their opponents in battle. 

This game will test not only your hand and eye coordination but also your ability to make quick decisions and good strategies. And because you will have to work with different players in your team with varying personalities, you will ultimately learn or acquire valuable traits like patience, leadership and the quality of being a teamplayer.

570,False,"This is review for 2020 from perspective of pos 4 player that playes with team members only so this review is more about the competetive side of dota then your casual ranking.

Pros:

-much faster gameplay then it used to be

-with full squad Its still as fun as it used to be

-being one trick pony pays off more

Cons:

-Solo players and team players are 2 different species. If we play in a squad of 4, the random guy most of the time has no idea what is team play.

-Meta play got worse. What I mean by that is, that if you dont play meta heores, you will f*cking lose no matter how good of a player you are. In team vs team games Its all about game strategy, not individual skill and there is not much space for creativity because the op heroes are really op and average heroes are just not good enough.

-Jungle drops after 40 mins are unbalanced, some are really trash in every situation compared to others.

-most meta heroes are not fun to play all the time. Like who the f*ck enjoys playing Viper every game?

-Repetetive gameplay due to the need to pick the same 15 heroes all the time if you want to win.

-RNG, but I mean, that was there since the beginning but its getting progressively worse. Yea, Iam looking at you Ogre.

Conclusion :

I havent played solo in a few years but when it comes to full squad 5 on 5, It got more boring because at higher levels, you have to pick the same shit all the time, which is not fun, or you will lose, which is also not fun.

Fun if you play like 4 games per week, play more and Its boring.",1487586206,127832.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

3- Kill other players for no apparent reason
4- Learn greetings from other countries like ""pota"", ""cibai"", ""bobo"", ""wkwk"" and ""tanga""

570,False,"What once was an awesome game, many of the great underused heroes have been neutralized to the point where playing them is no longer an option.  You can't play a support without the other four on your team cursing at you in a language you don't know while they feed ( due to a poor decision of how to que players ).  Many of the great heroes are classed as supports when they are better as nukers.  Zeus stopped being support the same time as Sven, Pugna and Necrophos, because none of them use support abilities to begin with.

Personally Pugna is my favorite hero, but everytime I play him mid, by minute ten the safelane's tier two tower is already at half health.  If I play him offlane, the mid player yells at the team for not ganking to mid as they lose their tower at six minutes.  Safelane is impossible because someone picked last second Phantom Assassin or Sniper and assume you are support them.  At twenty minutes you can kill any hero in three seconds with the right item and skill builds, but that rarely comes as your carries fed all that time.

Players during the weekends tend to be the teenagers home from school but think cursing out everyone makes them ""the man"".  The report system is flawed to that with the influx of bad players ( racist messages, intential feeding when you don't let them get last hits ), prevents the system from being correctly used as you are limited to one or two reports a week.  Many abuse the system such as if they are in a party on your team and you are the sole person not in their group, if you lose the game, it is your fault that you are 20 and 2, while it is the reverse for the rest of your team as you kept the game going longer in correcting their mistakes as long as you could.  There is no punishment for false reporting yet.

At this point I just play Techies, who as of the 7.00 patch, was made a laning nuking hero rather than a roaming wanderer with no direction.  I hate playing the game other than wanting explosions, pulling off high kill numbers and half the time we might win.  I recently played a game last night before I uninstalled for twelve hours to install other games for the time.  An Axe who thought he'd lane with me said to report me, when he tower dived under aggro from the tower, and I was no where near the fight to begin with.  Once again an idiot says to report another just because they thought they were ""the man.""

The game itself is great, the players are horrible people however, only thinking of themselves as the sole carry of the game, as they go on to not get a single kill for 30 minutes and being muted by the whole team far before hand for the racist rants that will never get reported because you spent your allotted one Report on someone the night before.  It would be great if the flaws were fixed with reporting players, then perhaps the game would be more likely to be played more often.",1487561855,279983.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.496957391500473

570,False,"If you want a game that freely promotes abuse, racism, narccessim, idiotism, name calling, masochism and believes that the only game that exists that is of any value to play is DotA... then you got it.

Avoid it like the plague. Due to an extreme fanatic behaviour, this game will steal your money since you don't worry too much about spending a few items on cosmetics here and there. I have wasted over 250€ on this 'free' game. I have also played it for over 2500 hours.

But here's the two reasons why I am stopping and why I will plead to anyone to stay away from this shite game:
1. The fanatic behaviour I spoke of before? It comes from a deep hatred of other games. Its direct competition is League of Legends and the reason why anyone who's played DotA for a long time is due to one of the founders of League had a website.
This website was the most used forums by DotA players and he cancelled it. He said it himself it was due to conflicting interests and it makes a lot of sense. But due to this the already extreme narcessists playing DotA became even more extreme. It is not uncommon or even considered unreasonable to insult people on EXTREME levels of death threats, ethics, ethnicity and skin colour because they aren't as good as someone who's put 2000+ hours into the game.

This is the first reason why I will plead to anyone to avoid this game, don't support its gambling and addictive nature and just stay away from it.

2. I realized a few months back which is when I kinda stopped playing. It is first now that I will genuinely sell my entire inventory and make sure to get rid of EVERYTHING to make it darn clear I don't want to come back.

A game of DotA is usually not too bad. However, when compared to other games an average game still makes you perhaps not smile or chuckle but it doesn't piss you off to just the nature of 'eh, this game was okey'. In DotA; those are the games that the most rare things to find.
The low points of most games gets you annoyed and you stop playing it. DotA digs you so deep into a hole that you keep playing and keep making it miserable for other people playing with you in the following games... even tho' they weren't even in the initial game that got you on this downward spiral.

The only thing that keeps folks coming back is those amazing games! However... they only feel so amazing due to how crappy every other match makes you feel like. The low points are insanely deep and the high points are just shallow victories. Not close matches that you had to fight for and had to use every arsenal you got. If you do that then you will have folks adding you on Steam and telling to kill yourself because you were split pushing and taking down their base as they just charge around on the map as an example.

Avoid the game. It is NOT a game to be played! It is one to avoid at ANY cost!",1487513241,153793.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4042879045009613

1. Apple Pie 

3 pounds mixed apples (such as Granny Smith, Gala and McIntosh)
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 disks dough for Basic Crust 
1 large egg, beaten
Coarse sugar, for sprinkling

Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour, cinnamon and salt; cook until thickened, 1 more minute. Let cool.

Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface; ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the apples, mounding them slightly in the center, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay it over the filling; press the edges of the crusts together, then fold the overhang under itself and crimp to seal. Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust. Chill 1 hour.

Place a baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet; lower the temperature to 375 degrees F.

570,True,"Love the game, but I'm not too crazy about the ppl. 1- Too much complaining about others all the time, ""my team sucks, you are bad, noob, etc etc"", if your are so good then win the game, even with a noobie team; it IS possible. I'm learning, I'm low level (I don't play ranked) so I don't need the review of someone that believes he is DotA God or something. It's a childish attitude, it's like you have the need to point it out ""it's not me; it's you"" (sometimes is the one who complains that is so selfish and not able to play as a team, but is the first on complaining and picking on someone else, a lot of times they are not even THAT good). Being ""bad"" at low lvl while one tries to improve is not a crime, and we have the right to play, as anyone else; 2- Too much complaining about ""unfair low prio"", by posting threads insulting everyone. If you know ""abusive behavior"" can make you have a report, why are you so surprised when it happens? Is not about being good or winning the game, is about the conduct, but it seems no one wants to take resposability for their own actions. 
3- TOO MUCH insults, for everything. It's really rare to pass by one game without being insulted or seeing how the others insults each other.
In any case, I still think this is one of the best games I ever played, and I will keep playing.

730,True,"Avoiding cheaters in Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) in 2026 primarily relies on leveraging Valve's Trust Factor system and utilizing third-party platforms with stronger anti-cheat measures. 
1. Optimize Your Trust Factor 
The Trust Factor is a hidden matchmaking score that groups you with players of similar trustworthiness. A high Trust Factor is the best way to avoid cheaters in official Valve matchmaking. 
Ensure Prime Status: This is essential to filter out the majority of free-to-play accounts where cheaters are more prevalent.
Be a Positive Community Member: Avoid toxicity, abusive chat/voice, and griefing (damaging/killing teammates or sabotaging matches). Positive behavior leads to fewer reports and a better Trust Factor.
Engage with Steam: Link a phone number for Steam Guard, make your profile public, own and play other non-CS2 games, and be active in the Steam community (e.g., commenting on guides, participating in discussions).
Avoid Unnecessary Reporting: Falsely or excessively reporting players who are simply better can negatively impact your own standing. Only report those you are genuinely convinced are cheating.
Play Legitimately: The system rewards consistent, legitimate play. Avoid using any third-party software that interacts with the game process, which might be flagged by the default Trusted Mode.
Play with Trusted Friends: Queuing with friends who have a high ""green"" Trust Factor can positively influence your matchmaking experience, acting like a social ""vouch"". 
2. Use Third-Party Matchmaking Platforms
If you still encounter too many cheaters in Valve's Premier mode, consider moving to third-party services that use more stringent anti-cheat software. 
FACEIT: This is the most popular alternative. It uses a proprietary, more intrusive (kernel-level) anti-cheat client that is significantly better at detecting and preventing cheats than Valve's VAC system. The overall match quality is often considered higher for dedicated players.
Other Platforms: Renown or other similar services also offer alternative matchmaking experiences with their own anti-cheat measures. 
3. In-Game Strategies (If a Cheater is Present)
If you do match with a cheater, the goal shifts from winning normally to minimizing their impact. 
Play as a Team: Cheaters often struggle against coordinated team play. Group up and use strategies that don't rely on typical map knowledge, such as using flashes or Molotovs to force them out of predictable positions.
Minimize Their Advantage: Avoid using smokes, as wall hackers can see through them.
Report and Move On: Report the player through the in-game interface and focus on the next game. VAC Live can occasionally remove cheaters mid-game",1767584920,1887.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

730,True,"CS2 is the only game that can ruin my mood, test my patience, and still be the first thing I boot up every day. Same Counter-Strike, new engine, same pain. And somehow… it’s still amazing.

Gunplay is clean, smokes are actually insane now, and when you hit a perfect one-tap you feel like the best player to ever touch a mouse. Five seconds later you whiff an entire mag and start blaming ping, teammates, and life in general.

Matchmaking is a social experiment. One teammate thinks it’s Faceit, one is playing with music on, and one just discovered WASD. But when the team clicks? Pure cinema. Clutches still make your heart stop, comebacks feel illegal, and winning a close game hits harder than it should.

Is it balanced? Sometimes. Is it stressful? Always. Do I still queue again instantly? Obviously.

Pros:
✔ Gunplay still unmatched
✔ Smokes go crazy
✔ Nothing feels better than a clutch

Cons:
✘ Teammates (again)
✘ Mental health debuff

The developers clearly don’t care about quality or the community. The game feels poorly designed, unbalanced, and driven by greed rather than creativity. Bugs, exploits, and hackers are ignored, while monetization is pushed aggressively. Progress often feels locked behind paywalls instead of skill or effort.

There’s no real future in investing time or money into this. The gameplay loop is repetitive, frustrating, and unrewarding, and the player experience keeps getting worse instead of better.

730,True,"Counter-Strike 2 is the Source 2 engine upgrade of CS:GO, retaining the core gameplay while delivering smoother competitive experience. With its mature esports and community ecosystem, it stands as one of the benchmarks for tactical shooters, perfect for hardcore competitive players and franchise fans.
 
Core Highlights
 
- Engine & Game Feel: Source 2 brings crisper graphics and more immersive 3D sound, with sub-tick technology enhancing operational responsiveness. Strafing to a stop is more forgiving, ballistics are smoother, kill feedback is satisfying, and the AWP and AK headshot feel is exceptional.

- Tactical Evolution: Smoke grenades feature enhanced interactivity (they can be dispersed by shooting), adding more depth to grenade tactics. Ranked mode introduces map banning/side selection, and the data panel is optimized, making the competitive experience fairer.

- Esports & Ecosystem: The VRS system refines the Major qualification path, boosting the watchability of tournaments. The skin market remains active, community-created content is abundant, and continuous efforts are made in anti-cheating measures.

- Optimization & Updates: Later optimizations have improved frame rates; map iterations (such as Inferno and Overpass) have expanded tactical space; and the animation system upgrade has enhanced realism.
 
Key Shortcomings
 
- Technical Issues: Sub-tick still faces controversies over synchronization and latency, with occasional discrepancies between hit registration and feedback in certain scenarios. Early optimization was poor, leading to increased power consumption for high-load hardware.

- Competitive Barrier: Mastering ballistics control and grenade techniques requires extensive practice, making new players prone to frustration due to skill gaps. Cheating issues have been mitigated but not completely eradicated, affecting fairness.

- Content Rhythm: There is no groundbreaking innovation in core gameplay, and new content updates at a slow pace. Adjustments to some maps have imposed an adaptation cost on veteran players.",1767446220,13202.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

730,True,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | A game built to last for decades

I’ve been playing Counter-Strike for a very long time — since 2013/2014 on another account — and that alone says a lot about this game. CS has never been about quick changes or hype. Things are often improved only when they really need to be — but when Valve does something, they usually do it right.

Over the years, almost everything has improved:
the graphics, the sound design, the maps, and especially the skins. Counter-Strike feels more modern than ever while still staying true to its core identity.

What also makes CS unique is that it’s more than just a game.
With the skin economy, it’s possible to build a portfolio over time and — with patience and smart decisions — actually earn money. Very few games combine skill, competition, nostalgia, and a real economy like this.

For me, one thing is clear:
Counter-Strike will still be around for many decades to come.

730,True,"This shit is hot garbage, but I can't stop playing. 

But for real, this game can be incredibly rewarding and frustrating. Hitting those difficult shots, dinking opponents for a one shot kill with an AK, clutching up when everybody else is dead; all of these situations are fun and can feel really good, but they are counterbalanced by the situations that don't feel great. Getting pixel peeked or killed by an opponent on a head glitch, getting killed by an opponent while they are running, having your spray go anywhere but the enemy's head (or even body sometimes) all make the game incredibly frustrating to play. I used to define the game like this around 100 hours in (I had played CSGO up to that point, and that was over the course of 6 years, so I didn't really care), but once I really started to play last year (2025), I realized I didn't know the mechanics, or how the game worked at all. I have played about 220 more hours than that at the time of the review, and everything I said before is true, but I actually know how to play the game now, so it isn't as infuriating. All this to say, if you feel like giving up because you are getting mad and don't have the greatest skill, keep going, practice your aim in workshop maps, play deathmatch, and even just getting more playtime on casual or competitive is great for building skill and game sense. I wouldn't even say I'm good, but I improved drastically compared to how I was performing before after doing that.

Now, 320 hours in, my biggest problem is the matchmaking. I only really play competitive and premier with friends, and it feels like we lose 9/10 games we play. Sure, this could just be a skill issue, and that is the problem. I looked it up, and supposedly those modes have skill based matchmaking, but it sure doesn't feel like it. My friends and I are about average, but it feels like we are going up against ex pros or people practicing to be pros. This is my biggest gripe with the game and I hope there will be some fix to it, because my premier rating keeps going down, seemingly due to no fault of my own.

That and random bs that the enemy pulls, almost always on me and my friends, then becoming a lobotomite in front of my/our random teamates if we don't have a 5 stack.

Though, to be fair, most of this game is random bs. Fun, but random.

Also, I wish more of my shots actually went where I was aiming.

730,False,"Counter-Strike used to reward precision, discipline, and game sense. Counter-Strike 2 stripped a lot of that away.

The game looks better, but it plays worse. Sub-tick was sold as an upgrade, yet gunfights feel inconsistent, movement feels floaty, and spraying is less predictable. The tight, learnable mechanics that made CS great are gone, replaced with a game that feels random instead of skill-driven.

The player experience is even worse. Matchmaking is flooded with clueless, zero-fundamentals players who don’t know smokes, rotations, or basic economy. Teamplay barely exists. Ranks feel meaningless when every match is a coin flip between people who grind the game and people who treat it like deathmatch.

730,True,"Dear Counter-Strike,

I don’t know when you stopped being just a game and started feeling like a place I return to, but I know exactly how it feels every time I load you up.

There’s a quiet before the round starts.
The freeze time.
The stillness where everyone pretends they’re calm.

I’ve lived in that silence more times than I can count.

You never tried to impress me. You never gave me spectacle or power fantasies. You gave me a gun, a map I learned inch by inch, and a clock that always ran out faster than I expected. From the beginning, you were honest: if something went wrong, it was probably my fault.

And that hurt. But it also kept me coming back.

You taught me that aim is only part of the story. That knowing where to stand matters more than how fast I click. That patience can win rounds just as often as aggression, and that hesitation can lose them instantly. You taught me how small mistakes echo. One step too loud. One reload at the wrong time. One glance away from an angle I swore was clear.

I remember learning your economy like it was a language. Saving when I wanted to buy. Buying when it felt irresponsible. Trusting that losing one round now might give us a better chance later. I learned that discipline isn’t flashy, and that winning doesn’t always feel good in the moment—it just feels right.

You didn’t protect me from other people. You threw me straight into them.

Strangers who knew more than I did. Strangers who knew less and thought they knew everything. Teammates who carried me. Teammates who blamed me. Voices that encouraged, voices that tilted, voices that went silent after one bad round. You let all of it happen. You never curated the experience. You let it be human.

Every clutch felt personal. Every whiff felt humiliating. I remember hands shaking in a 1v2, heart racing like something real was on the line. And when I failed, there was no cinematic slow-mo, no soft landing. Just the sound of a round ending and the quiet realization that I could have done better.

But when I succeeded—when everything lined up just once—it felt earned in a way few games ever manage. Not lucky. Not handed to me. Earned.

You changed over time. New engine. New lighting. New sounds. New smokes that bloom and breathe and punish sloppy lineups. But underneath all of it, you stayed the same. You still demanded attention. You still punished laziness. You still rewarded people who were willing to learn slowly and lose honestly.

I’ve left you before. I always do. I tell myself I’m done. That I don’t need the stress, the frustration, the emotional investment. And then one day I hear the sound of a round starting, or see a familiar corner of a map, and I remember exactly why I stayed so long in the first place.

You don’t make me feel powerful.
You make me feel responsible.

Every time I play you, I’m confronted with myself—my patience, my discipline, my ability to stay calm under pressure, my willingness to admit fault and improve. You don’t care who I am outside the server. You only care about what I do in the next 1 minute and 55 seconds.

And I respect that.

I don’t love you because you’re fun all the time. I love you because you’re fair. Because when I lose, I usually know why. Because when I win, I know I earned it. Because you never pretended to be anything other than what you are: a test that never ends.

I’ll probably step away again.
I’ll probably come back rusty.
I’ll probably relearn the same lessons.

And you’ll be there. Unmoved. Waiting.

Thanks for the discipline.
Thanks for the silence before the round.
Thanks for reminding me that improvement is slow, and that’s okay.

Yours,
Someone who still checks corners they don’t need to.",1767371743,8292.0,True,False,False,7,0,0.6221928596496582

730,True,"Counter-Strike 2 is not about heroics or cinematic glory. It is about precision, timing, and the fragile advantage held in the space between bullets. You enter every map knowing that one misstep, one hesitation, or one overlooked corner can end your round—and possibly your match. There are no second chances once the trigger breaks.

The maps are unforgiving. Tight corridors, open squares, and chokepoints all demand respect. Sound becomes your weapon as much as your gun—footsteps, reloads, and echoes reveal more than sight ever could. Every step, every peek, every jump is a risk calculation. Overcommit, and you die. Wait too long, and you die. There is no middle ground.

Your tools are simple but absolute. Pistols, rifles, grenades, and knives are extensions of your decision-making. A smoke can obscure vision or betray a plan. A flashbang can buy a fraction of a second or blind your own team. Every shot matters. Every aim is measured against human reflexes, not AI patterns. Victory comes from outthinking and outreacting real opponents, one precise movement at a time.

Teamwork is survival. Communication is not optional. Coordinated pushes, callouts, and support fire define whether your strategy succeeds or collapses. Alone, you are exposed; with your team, you are lethal. Distrust or miscommunication can turn advantage into disaster in an instant.

Rounds are short but consequential. One clutch, one defusal, one perfectly timed peek can swing momentum. The pressure never relents. Between rounds, the map resets, but the tension carries over. Past mistakes linger in the mind, shaping every decision the next round.

Counter-Strike 2 does not reward spectacle. It rewards composure, anticipation, and split-second judgment. There are no cinematic victories. There is only the quiet satisfaction of a well-executed plan, or the sting of a mistake that cannot be undone.

You do not dominate the match.

You survive it, round by round, breath by breath, and shot by shot.",1767307633,21285.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4761904776096343

730,True,"Counter-Strike 2: The Gold Standard of Tactical Shooters in 2026
After more than two years since its release, Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) has truly come into its own, proving that Valve’s transition to the Source 2 engine was the right move for the franchise's future. While the launch had its hurdles, the state of the game in 2026 is nothing short of phenomenal.
Visuals and Atmosphere
The graphical leap from CS:GO is still breathtaking. The lighting system in Source 2 transforms iconic maps like Inferno and Overpass into vibrant, realistic arenas. The addition of the 2026 Service Medal and rumors of Cache returning to the competitive pool show that the world is more alive than ever. Weapon skins also look better than ever, with realistic metallic reflections that make your inventory feel truly premium.
The Smoke Revolution
The dynamic volumetric smoke remains the most significant gameplay innovation in a decade. Being able to ""clear"" smoke with a well-placed HE grenade or create lines of sight by shooting through it has added a deep layer of strategy that makes every round feel unique. It's no longer just a wall; it's a living part of the tactical environment.
Performance and Sub-tick
By 2026, Valve has ironed out most of the initial performance issues. On modern hardware, the game runs incredibly smooth with high frame rates, and the sub-tick system—which ensures that movement and shooting are registered the exact millisecond they happen—feels crisp and responsive. The networking is now at a point where the ""tick-rate wars"" of the past are a distant memory.
Fair Play and Esports
The competitive scene is thriving. With the Premier mode and global leaderboards, there is always a reason to grind. Most importantly, the recent major upgrades to VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) in late 2025 have significantly cleaned up the matchmaking experience, making high-level games feel much fairer.
Final Verdict
Counter-Strike 2 is the definitive competitive FPS experience in 2026. It retains the core DNA that made the series a legend while pushing the boundaries of what a modern shooter can be. Whether you are a veteran with thousands of hours or a newcomer looking for the best tactical challenge, there has never been a better time to jump in.",1767297406,61647.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Some games change every year and lose themselves.
Counter-Strike never really did.

The gameplay is simple on the surface, but deep where it matters.
Movement feels tight, gunplay is raw, and every mistake is on you.
There’s no hand-holding here — if you win, you earned it 🎯

That’s the beauty of Counter-Strike.
It doesn’t try to impress you with gimmicks.
It trusts its mechanics, and it trusts the player.
Skill, positioning, timing — that’s the game.

Of course, it’s not perfect.
Cheaters are a real problem, and the anti-cheat often feels a step behind 🚫
In a game this competitive, even a few bad matches can ruin the mood.

Still, when you get a clean match with fair players,
Counter-Strike reminds you why it’s still here after all these years.
Few shooters feel this honest ;)

730,True,"Overview: Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is the latest iteration of the iconic tactical first-person shooter series developed by Valve. Released as a major upgrade to the legendary Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), CS2 brings significant improvements in graphics, gameplay mechanics, and anti-cheat technology, aiming to modernize the experience while preserving the core competitive elements that made the franchise a staple in esports.

Graphics and Performance: CS2 introduces a revamped Source 2 engine, delivering enhanced visual fidelity with more realistic lighting, textures, and environmental effects. The improved engine also optimizes performance, allowing smoother gameplay even on mid-range hardware. This upgrade provides a fresh yet familiar aesthetic that appeals to both veteran players and newcomers.

Gameplay Enhancements: While maintaining the classic tactical gameplay, CS2 refines several mechanics to improve balance and player experience:

Improved hit registration and weapon recoil: These changes make gunplay feel more responsive and skill-based.
Updated maps: Classic maps have been reworked with better visuals and minor layout tweaks to enhance competitive play.
New features: CS2 introduces subtle quality-of-life improvements such as better matchmaking, spectator tools, and UI enhancements.
Anti-Cheat and Fair Play: One of the standout features of CS2 is its AI-powered anti-cheat system. This advanced technology aims to detect and prevent cheating more effectively than previous iterations, addressing one of the biggest issues in competitive shooters. Early reports suggest this system is a significant step forward in maintaining fair play and restoring trust in ranked matches.

Community and Esports: CS2 has been well-received by the competitive community, with many praising Valve's commitment to preserving the core gameplay while modernizing the experience. The game supports a thriving esports scene with improved tournament integration and spectator features, making it easier for fans to follow competitive matches.

Monetization and Skins: The game continues the tradition of cosmetic skins and collections, with new sets introduced for 2026. Players are advised to invest in certain collections, such as the Overpass collection, which has shown promising value retention. Valve has maintained a balanced approach to monetization, focusing on cosmetics without impacting gameplay fairness.

Pros:

Significant graphical and performance improvements with the Source 2 engine.
Enhanced gameplay mechanics that refine the classic Counter-Strike experience.
AI-driven anti-cheat system improving competitive integrity.
Strong support for esports and community engagement.
Continued availability of cosmetic customization with valuable skin collections.
Cons:

Some players may need time to adjust to updated mechanics and map changes.
As a major update, initial bugs and balancing issues are expected but are being actively addressed by developers.
Conclusion: Counter-Strike 2 successfully revitalizes a beloved franchise by blending classic tactical gameplay with modern technology and features. Its improved graphics, refined mechanics, and robust anti-cheat system make it a compelling choice for both longtime fans and new players. With strong community support and ongoing updates, CS2 is poised to remain a dominant force in competitive FPS gaming throughout 2026 and beyond.

If you are a fan of tactical shooters or competitive esports, CS2 is highly recommended as the next evolution of the Counter-Strike legacy.",1767253225,10454.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

It was all removed in favour of ""Casual"", where matches can start with 3-6 players on each team (instead of the nearly full 12v12 lobbies), or you could join a match that has already ended, or have no option to avoid a steam roll (You used to be able to change teams and also call a vote to scramble teams to even out the odds!), and lastly, the matches can last less than 5 minutes before sending you into another long loading screen...

I would love to change my rating because this is genuinely one of the best FPS shooters out there, but I can't condone what Valve is doing, clearly knowing they can get away with as little content as possible while earning tons of money.",1767473924,10733.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of them crooks:
Rooking their guests and cooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve them of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
Never was a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges
Plus, some little extras on the side!
(Oh Santa!)

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice (Hand it over!)
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks I knows
How it all increases, all those bits and pieces
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

Master of the house? Isn't worth my spit!
Comforter, philosopher and lifelong shit!
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!

Master of the house!
Master and a half!
Comforter, philosopher
Don't make me laugh!
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Hypocrite and toady and inebriate!

Everybody bless the landlord!
Everybody bless his spouse!

Everybody raise a glass
Raise it up the master's arse
Everybody raise a glass to the Master of the House!

- Toxic ""friendlies"" (they could fucking doxx you if they would want to)
- Pedos, preds and much more
- Community as a whole hates you if you DARE to say anything bad aboud valve or TF2 (pretty much same as friendlies)
- CS2 exist, why play this when theres a better shooter game
- Game is dying, which means dead servers
- With each ""holiday sized update"" game is broken for weeks until valve decides to fix it
- Sprays and objectors are mostly used just to portray sexual themes (met once a guy who made R34 art of hatsune miku, which she is 16 btw and was proudly showing it to whole server)
- Racists, sexists, homophobs, xenophobs etc.

1. Sometimes the game won't launch (IDK if thats a me problem)
2. There isn't too much weapon variety-you basically get a couple of things to choose from and some are clearly better than others.

Overall, its a great game though. The game is free, so theres no reason not to try it. And if you don't like it, you won't feel like you got scammed. Just don't use voice chat. Seriously.",1764711456,3067.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5
440,True,"You can play this game without paying a single dime, it costs absolutely nothing to download and play normally without voice chat, text chat, anything like that. All you have to do is buy any one item in TF2, some costing as little as a dollar, and you'll gain access to voice chat and be able to communicate with other players. I'd encourage any players who want to get good at the game to either buy some weapons they want to try out or grind the achievements and unlock a few weapons that way. The main thing about TF2 is that there are multiple ways you can play. What I mean is that there are 9 characters, or ""classes"" you can play as. I recommend trying them all out and seeing which ones you like playing the best. Me personally, I think that the Engineer, Spy, and Soldier are my three favorite classes to play. However, other players might like to play other classes like Scout, Demoman, Medic, or Heavy. It all really depends on YOUR playstyle what classes suit you best, So here's what I recommend to people just looking at this game and reading the reviews before downloading: Spend some time (preferably equal amounts) on each class and find out what playstyle you like best. There are stock weapons for each class, but I'd recommend trying out some weapons in the shop (There's a free trial option for those who aren't sure about a weapon they want to try that gives a 25% discount on them during the trial that you can do once a week) to try to optimize your playstyle. My default spy loadout, for example, has the ""Deadringer"" watch, the ""Your Eternal Reward"" knife, and the ""L'etranger"" pistol because they work so well together when going behind enemy lines and killing off the enemy team wile staying hidden.

TLDR: Try everything. Throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. Learn your playstyle. Once you do what you love, you'll love what you do. That's what makes TF2 so fun in the end.",1764658722,5110.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

440,True,"I've been playing multiplayer FPS games since the end of the 90s and I have to say that this one is at the top of my list. Now i really love this game so this review is by definition very subjective. 

Here are my reasons : 
 
Positives : 
- The artwork, graphics, lore and general atmosphere are just fantastic
- The characters are hilarious and unique in their own steriotypical way 
- The gameplay is solid and teamwork is crucial - a solid team which knows how to work together will almost always win over individual skill
- The overall balance is relatively good given the amount of builds and weapons available today (which will always be a cause of balancing issues). 
- Communication is needed but no mic is essential thanks to a good number of voice commands
- A good variety of maps and different game mods
- Quality updates throughout the years (while the game is still supported properly)
- Music, voice acting and sound effects are quality ! 

Negatives (most have to do with the current situation) : 
- No more updates
- Perhaps too many weapons and items which are borderline useless with most older or vanilla builds still being the most effective ones (just my opinion) 
- Bots being present on multiple servers (a long lasting issue, not sure how much of it was fixed though)
- Not many servers rolling old time popular maps (GoldRush, Badwater are almost impossible to find today)
- Overload of cosmetics and flare which takes away from the original art theme (once again, more of a personal one for me) 

Now, i am rating the game based on all of the time i've spent on it, not just its current state. I think it is safe to say that the game is not at its best and has some major issues, but to be fair, it has been running on fumes for some time now. Some updates were amazing, some less so but it was always new and refreshing even though some aspects were not for everyone. I find myself a bit nostalgic about the past state of this game and i do play it less today. However, i still come back to it from time to time for a quick game on a public server even after 1700+ hours. 

To sum up, an amazing experience which i would recommend to anyone who enjoys Class Based Team vs Team shooters with various objectives.  

P.S.: I have briefly tried mods which attempt to bring the ""genuine"" TF2 experience back to the game such as TF2 Classic and TF2 Gold Rush. I do recommend everyone who is a fan of this game to try them out. Even though both have a rather subjective take on what TF2 originally should be like, they do make me feel like i am going back to a more simpler time without the overload of cosmetics). I think newer players should check them out as well (more for the feel rather than the mechanics and balance which do not resemble the past reality).

440,False,"In its current state, I cannot recommend Team Fortress 2. To anyone.

I love this game, I've loved this game since I started playing it, but the only real way to play it now is to join the very limited amount of community servers with specific rulesets that aren't the vanilla game or don't run the standard maps in rotation.

Valve has left the game in a borderline unplayable state since Meet Your Match released and have done little to nothing to fix it. Casual mode (and by extension Competitive mode) are horribly buggy messes that should have never been introduced into the game. A matchmaking system is entirely antithetical to what Team Fortress 2 is; a casual pick-up put-down first person shooter. Until this issue is addressed, my review will remain negative.

440,True,"This game is (almost) a gold standard of balance that can hold both the test of time and extreme conditions. Community tinkering and experience have pushed this game so far and the depth of the game means that almost 18 (!) years later the playerbase is still kicking and rabid as ever.

There's not much that can be said about this game that hasn't been discussed at least 3 times over, however I will still point out one of the flaws that strikes the hardest to me, that being the weapon balance.

The stock classes themselves are fine and show a lot of tweaking and thought into their designs, however some items that were added after initial release do not show this consideration, such as the Homewrecker for Pyro, the Vaccinator for Medic and also some of the weaker weapons like Sun on a Stick for Scout, Red Tape Recorder for Spy or the Eviction Notice for Heavy.

This game overall is great though, and many criticisms about game balance were unanticipated on Valve's part or are tied into the map design of popular maps added by the community.",1763339838,95546.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Soldier: ""A RED Spy is in the base!?""

[Intruder Alert begins to play. The Soldier reaches from off-screen and pulls a Shotgun off a rack of weapons. Cut to the Soldier dashing down the stairs and through the 2Fort sublevel while saying ""Hut, Hut, Hut!"" with every step he takes]

The Administrator: ""Protect the briefcase!""

Soldier: ""We need to protect the briefcase!""

[Camera pans to reveal the BLU Scout trying to open the code-locked 'Briefcase Room' door]

Scout: ""Yo, a lil' help here!?""

[The Soldier pushes the Scout aside and begins to 'decode' the combination]

Soldier: ""All right, all right, I got it. Stand back son. 1, 1, 1, umm... 1!""

Scout: Let's go, let's go-

[BLU Heavy comes around the corner, Sasha in hand, charging towards the Scout and Soldier]

Heavy: ""INCOMING!""

[Heavy shoulder-barges the door, destroying it. The three of them are sent tumbling and screaming into the Intelligence Room. The Scout reaches the desk to discover the briefcase is perfectly safe]

Scout: [while screaming, he notices the briefcase] ""AAAAAHHHH- Hey, it's still here!""

Heavy: ""-AAAAalright then.""

Spy: ""Ahem.""

[Camera zooms in to reveal the BLU Spy, with the BLU Sniper's corpse over one shoulder]

Spy: ""Gentlemen.""

Spy: ""I see the briefcase is safe.""

Soldier: ""Safe and sound, mm-hmm.""

Scout: ""Yeah, it is!""

Spy: ""Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?""

[The other three BLUs shake their heads and shrug]

Spy: ""No? Then we still have a problem.""

[He deposits the Sniper's body on the desk, revealing a bloody Knife in his back]

Soldier: ""...and a knife.""

[The Scout approaches and removes the knife]

Scout: ""Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Spies; they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you!""

[The Scout attempts to manipulate the knife like the Spy, only to cut himself on the finger and drop it]

Scout: ""Ow! No offense.""

Spy: ""If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were not like me."" [The Spy deftly retrieves the knife and flicks it shut, handing it back to the Scout] ""And nothing... nothing like the man loose inside this building.""

Scout: ""What're you? President of his fan club?""

[The Soldier and Heavy chuckle]

[The Spy turns to face the Scout]

Spy: ""No... that would be your mother!""

[The Spy reveals a folder and slaps it down on the table, revealing several compromising photographs of the RED Spy and the Scout's mother]

Scout: [stammers out of shock and disbelief]

Spy: ""Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.""

[[[Right Behind You]] plays]

[The Soldier and Heavy examine the photographs. The Heavy leans over and shows the Soldier one photo in particular]

Soldier: ""Oh!""

[The Scout frantically retrieves the photos as the Spy lights and smokes a cigarillo in the foreground]

Scout: ""Gimme that!""

Spy: ""This Spy has already breached our defenses...""

[Fade to the RED Spy, creeping through the Hydro tunnels. He pauses at a corner, as the camera pulls back to reveal a BLU Level 3 Sentry Gun with its Engineer. He slides an Sapper across the floor, disarming and destroying the Sentry Gun immediately]

Engineer: ""Sentry Down!""

[The BLU Engineer throws his Wrench down and frantically reaches for his Pistol, only to have the Spy shoot him in the head with the Revolver. The dead Engineer crashes through a door and the Spy steps over him and fires at a target off-screen]

[Cut back to the BLU Intelligence Room. The BLU Spy leans over the dead Sniper, gesturing frantically.]

Spy: ""You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!""

[Flashback to the BLU Sniper, now alive and sniping from a dusty attic. The RED Spy creeps up on him and steps on a creaking floorboard, alerting the Sniper, who engages the Spy with the Kukri. A struggle ensues, and the Sniper is ultimately backstabbed]

[Cut back to BLU Intelligence Room]

Spy: ""And worst of all, he could be any one of us...""

[Fade to the RED Spy fighting a BLU Medic, armed with a Bonesaw]

Medic: ""Raus, raus!""

[The Spy breaks the Medic's arm, disarming him. Close-up on the Spy's face as he disguises as the Medic, sans spectacles]

Medic: [gasps] ""Nein...""

[The Spy kills the Medic with a well-placed chop to the throat, knocking off his spectacles, which he catches and wears, completing his disguise]

[Cut back to BLU Intel Room. The BLU Spy looks frantic]

Spy: ""He could be in this very room! He could be you! He could be me! He could even be-""

[The Spy is cut off as his head explodes violently. The camera switches to the Soldier, Shotgun in hand, with a confused Heavy and a panicked Scout]

Scout: ""Whoa, whoa, whoa!""

Heavy: ""Oh!""

Soldier: ""What? It was obvious!"" [The Soldier pumps his Shotgun, discarding the spent shell.] ""He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...""

[The Soldier and Heavy approach the dead Spy, with The Soldier prodding the Spy's foot with his Shotgun]

Soldier: ""Any second now... See? Red! Oh, wait... that's blood.""

[The Scout lingers behind, his expression sinister. He approaches the Soldier and Heavy, retrieving the knife he pocketed earlier, and flicking it open easily. As he approaches, he flickers and melts, revealing himself to be the RED Spy]

Heavy: ""So, we still got problem...""

Soldier: ""Big problem... all right, who's ready to go find this Spy?""

Spy: ""Right behind you.""

[Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays, with the stabbing of the Soldier and Heavy punctuating the beat of the tune.]

[Petite Chou-Fleur plays]

[Fade to the scattered photos of the Scout's mother. The RED Spy retrieves one of them and smiles wistfully]

440,True,"I'm reviewing this primarily to review every game in my steam library. So this will have limited value. But I'll do my best. 

TF2 is the foundation of many people's entire selves. It is a game that is fundamentally tied to the fans that have supported it for years on end. It sparked creativity in so many people and has led to some incredible fan works. Some of which being as long and complex as feature films. So how does the game compare to its effects?

It's pretty alright. TF2 is a fun class shooter game that was the early foundation for modern entries like Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, and the like. It is goofy and ridiculous while also being a competent game on top of that. There's a lot of value in creating team comp strats that win you games in fun, niche ways. There are jokes to be had and friends to make throughout your experience playing. It's sort of old feeling, but not so much so that you feel like you're playing a game from the late 2000's. I'm sort of glazing the game because truthfully, it's not entirely my cup of tea. It doesn't need to be though and I respect the hell out of it. 

For new players, I don't know how much I can really recommend this game. It's good fun, but it's got it's issues. The bot issue was made better, but idk if that held since I last heard about it. The player base isn't wholly the same as it once was. You'll get an experience by playing it, but that'll be what you make of it. Just don't expect things to go super ultra smoothly like you're picking up a modern version of this concept. 

Definitely check it out though. For the price of absolutely free, I can't really say no to giving it a shot. Also, the worst that can happen is you hate it and uninstall. This is the foundation for a lot of different things, and if you recognize the game at all or are a returning fan, then you'll have a good time here.",1762068803,137.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The population that plays this game has decreased in quality dramatically since its last update (2017) likely due to covid causing a surge of new PC owners and gamers.

Players are certainly more competent or aware on average than they were a decade ago, which one may think would lead to better match quality, but they are also more exploitative of the game's poorly designed mechanics and systems, and they speedrun matches so they can get back to the loading screen ASAP. you rarely see players who actually like TF2 for what makes it special and try to achieve mastery of mechanics and instead see a flood of people basically cheesing games to get petty ""victories"" and achieve the fleeting ecstasy that only a subtard could feel upon being told that they ""won""",1759716121,331921.0,True,False,False,9,0,0.5453110933303833

440,True,"Team Fortress 2 is a masterpiece that Valve has largely abandoned, yet it refuses to die. Despite experiencing no significant updates, facing a bot crisis, and suffering from balancing issues, you can still hop in and find a surprisingly nice community. Most players are just there to have fun, which is a refreshing contrast to the profound immaturity often displayed in the game.

When you load into a new match, whether casual or community, you meet at least 20 new players. While some are genuinely nice, many are more interested in making connections than actually playing the game. You might even receive a marriage proposal in the chat, often from someone with a name as insufferable as the proposal itself.

The game features nine unique and iconic classes, each offering something for everyone. It’s like a buffet of mayhem! The art style is reminiscent of a comic book, standing the test of time and never looking bad. The Meet the Team videos provide insight into each class's specialties and showcase the game’s goofy tone, while the SFM videos represent a beautiful art form that I hope never disappears. 

I've been playing since 2008 on PS3, and words cannot fathom my love for this game. It has a deep place in my heart, and the late nights I played with friends growing up, hold fond memories. It’s a laid-back game where you can chat and play in the background, sometimes a guilty pleasure, other times a time killer, but always somehow a good time. Despite its flaws, Team Fortress 2 remains a favorite, likely always will be, and may it live forever, continuing to evoke a sense of nostalgia and connection.",1757144778,49928.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

When I first joined, it was constantly emphasized how I was “late to the party” because this game lacks proper updates for over seven years now. But I still find myself incredibly attached and involved. TF2 is the kind of game that doesn’t need updates to live on, and is instead propelled forward by the community around it. This game has a lot of fight in it and an even bigger army of fans behind it. I hope to see it prosper on now and in the far future.

sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a
terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful
prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower
for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek
Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can
do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now
Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew
your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast,
back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted.
Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25
pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small.
You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance.
Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy. Five
shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don't let them do it! Next. What do you
got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh,
go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. You
boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I
love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He
can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen house
fly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way!
Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under
arrest. And transport you to designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I
say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you
talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there
with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There
was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends? But I... I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Hey
wait a minute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and me in green fighting machine.
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't
mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you
definitively need some tic-tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've ??? my note!
Just like the time... ...and then I ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of
my but that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one
here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There's no one to derive me. But you got to have
free ... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend
would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... ...really tall? No!
I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really?
-Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I
like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: ""I don't care what nobody thinks of me"" thing. I like
that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like
that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's
amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess,
you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have
in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they
won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can
I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't
how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick
together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only. -Huh, thank you! A,
what are you do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in
the morning... I'm making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside! Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know, I
don't know you and you don't know me... ... so I guess, outside is best for me. Here I go. Good
night. I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I guess. I'm all
alone, there's no one here beside me. -I thought, I told you to stay outside. -I am outside. Well
James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not... What a lovely bed. -Got
you! I found some cheese. Awful stuff. -Is that you Gordon? -How did you know? Enough! What are
you doing in my house? Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table! Where would we supposed to
put her. The bed's taken. What? I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre! What do I
have to do, to get a little privacy? Oh, no! No, no! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get
out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go. And hurry up, hurry up. No, no, not there. Not
there! Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What? We were forced
to come here. -By who? Lord Farquaad. He ??? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do. I know where he is. Does anyone else know where to find him? -Anyone at all? -Me.
-Anyone? Oh pick me, I know! Me, me. Ok, fine. Attention all fairy tale things! Do not get
comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up. In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right
now and get all off my land and back where you came from. You. You're coming with me. All right.
That's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city
adventure. I love it. I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again... What did I say about
singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Well, can I hummer? -All right. That's enough. He's ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. You monster. I'm not
a monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world. -Now
tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me. I've tried to be fair to you, creatures. Now my patience has
reached its end! -Tell me! Or I'll... -No, no, not the buttons. Not gumdrop buttons. All right! Who's
hiding them? Ok, I'll tell you. -Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man? -The muffin-man.

If you're not that, do yourself a favor and play Marvel Rivals, because I'm sure whoever is reading this hates Overwatch for... uh. Reasons? I'm sure they have their reasons. 

Team Fortress 2 is a very rare instance of being a game that has what I'd like to call a 'flashbulb' version of it because it hasn't gotten a single substantial update since 2017. What you play today is what you'd be playing in 2017, with the only difference being a dwindling player base and a massive influx in cheaters. Unfortunately, the bot crisis was never fixed and if you dare to step foot outside of the cheater-infested Valve servers, you'd be submitting yourself to some of the most heinous online experiences that you'll ever have through community servers. 

Trade servers are dead, Valve servers are infested with bots, community servers are overrun with people that don't play the game.

The bot crisis has finally be solved, so casual is fixed (for now). 

Dislike: Updates are anomalies (there's one coming out of the blue in a few months for MvM, but it's 100% community made). There is no real direction for the game going forward outside of maintenance. Only really two seasons now (winter and Summer) which are both 6 months long. Would be nice if we got at least three (Winter, Summer, and Spring). At this stage of the game, crate keys should be a dollar cheaper. Or at least more chances to get a hat/cosmetic as a regular weekly drop.  New class weapons are also never coming now that the game is so old. Old updates were canned (like invasion, or Heavy update). If Valve made TF3, would we even want to move over to it and lose all our stuff?

As someone who used to play tf2 at its ""prime"" , It's still the same game if you think about it (except all the bots n cheaters apocalypse thats going on) but overall , same good old tf2 that makes me laugh.

As an fps shooter game i'd say its very good , each class is unique enough by itself to make the game x10 intresting. And well , thats the reason I have 3k+ hours on it .

It is a massive shame Valve no longer seems to game what makes it into the game due to lack of quality control, because this was once a consistently beautiful looking game. So much love has been put into creating a world for these characters, the lore, cinematics, map visual cues.. real shame all that is now burried under this rug made of bright nonsensical cosmetics and terrible update decisions bloated with maps, taunts and cosmetics that frankly just don't fit the game..

The random social interactions with strangers only using voice commands, chat or just even taunts is something you will truly not get in any other game.

440,True,"Timeless masterpiece, unfortunately, it's only updated enough for it to be playable and in no fault of the now small development team. 

This game keeps me coming back after so long due to two things:
-It's endlessly customisable and satisfying game play. Dominating the entire server through nothing but skill and manipulating the game's engine to perform wild stunts, outsmarting opponents, has provided me with one of the most addicting game play loops a multiplayer game has ever had.
-The community surrounding it; still alive after almost 2 decades. It may seem toxic at first (as with any multiplayer FPS game), but I have enjoyed so many heartwarming and hilarious moments with random players thousands of miles away that I will probably never see again. 

The humour and inside gags within the player-base stretch beyond the game and into social media. I started watching Team Fortress 2 videos long before I even bought the game. Compilations and fan animations still appear in my YouTube recommended after several-month-long breaks between gaming sessions, as I laugh along with people from 18 years ago to the same stupid jokes.
I hope to remember this as more than a game, but a major part of my younger life. It meant, means and will mean so much to so many people.

I didnt think think this would become an essay lol.

This game is my childhood, I can't lie it's tough to play sometimes these days with all that's happening on screen, especially in community servers, but you can't deny this community is hardy.

Even if this game was crap, TF2's 'Meet the Team' series would make it a 6/10 on it's own by relation. But it's not so bad, lovely controlled chaos with intermittent blatant homophobia and racism, internet standard.

Okay, so this is one of those games where you don't need any level of experience beyond just standard PvP FPS stuff to get into it. However,
-paid content includes having fun, in-game chat*, storing more than a handful of items
-lots and lotsa toxic players, they don't normally interact with people beyond dominating lobbies though
-source(TM)  jank©
Jank includes anything from the unintended demoknight, battle medic and Pootis sub-classes all the way to backstab flings, that one window on pl_frontier, and a lot of weird reasons for getting stuck on things. The game traces its roots back to a HL2 mod and as such has matured over a long time. There's a grand old well of user generated content you can get into for free on a lot of community servers, which is a great way to have fun or play warioware if you don't want to pay for it. Seriously, check out the custom maps people make, it's incredible. 

Game culture you might want to know about: 
-Friendlies: usually seen dancing in groups, crouching with melee weapons or doing other funny shit. Killing them is normally rude, unless the whole server is dancing. At that point, I'd consider it okay to re-queue for something else or start using your tauntkills.
-Pootis: a quasi-friendly species, the Pootis is found in ctf_2Fort and many other gardens of slow gameplay. Though some are un-adorned heavy players, one can easily tell a pootis by their behaviour and colourful, often whimsical plumage. They most typically sport a beanie with tassels and a sandvich in hand, with other colourful garments seen often. They are typically friendlies. If you attack them, they may stop at nothing to kill you in a demeaning way. They may attack first, in which case the winner is whoever tauntkills the other first.
-If someone dies suddenly, with no attacks made, they have used a 'killbind'. It is a common joke. To make your own:
     1- open settings from within the game. From the popup for changing controls, select [Advanced...] -> [enable developer console]
     2- with the console enabled, hit `~ key (top left of keyboard)
     3- don't worry about the code, you're not going to hack anything (probably)
     4- enter this phrase without the quotes: 'bind k kill' and press enter
                         (you can select another key to bind but k is easy to remember and not used by default)
     5- disable the developer console, it's really annoying mid-game.

He lick my dick and the cum start dripping
I took a bite out of his ass it tastes like lemon pepper chicken
He throw me up in the air my booty flipping
He dug his balls in my booty like he's Scotty Pippen
Met the nihha last night
Then I rode his dick like a bike

440,True,"I told myself I would write a review for this game when the time was right. This game has allowed me to meet some pretty incredible—and awful—people. A lot of the game involves mic spam, unfair matchmaking, and crits. But every now and then, you meet some truly amazing people.

As someone who struggled with making friends and social skills, this game has been my home. Over my 10 years of playing, I’ve learned that Team Fortress 2 constantly challenges the phrase, “Now I’ve seen everything.” You’ll always find new experiences, many laughs, and a community that—despite its rot and age—still loves the game.

(Minus the horrid people on the TF2 Emporium. Valve, you really need to address that and do a better job curating.)

I joined this game near the end of its heyday and the beginning of its sunset era. I’ve met friends in real life through this game. I’ve also seen a lot of people move on from it. Real life is important, and the people in it matter. Every once in a while, I check in on people I used to play with years ago. Some are doing just fine; others, not so much. Some are in college, others are getting married, and some have kids now.

That’s why this review, albeit small, really hits home for me. It doesn’t end with updates. The mods, maps, hats, people, weapons, characters, and more all add to the game. TF2 isn’t just a game—it’s an icon.

Thank you to everyone who played this game with me over the years. To the friends who read this that I met in TF2, you’ve given me a timeless memory, and I won’t soon forget you. I look forward to playing with everyone again soon.",1747196771,180645.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

440,False,"Oh, Team Fortress 2, you glorious, aging dumpster fire of a game still chugging along like a 2007 jalopy with a “Honk if You Love Hats” bumper sticker. Once a shining beacon of class-based shooters, TF2 has devolved into a bizarre social experiment where toxic players and brain-dead strategies collide in a cacophony of voice chat slurs and rocket-jumping regrets.

Let’s start with the community, because nothing says “welcome” like a 12-year-old moron named ""Piller Croc"" screaming the N-word through a $2 Walmart mic, threatening to kick you to let his friend in, while his teammate ""xX_SniperGod420_Xx"" types “EZ” after missing 17 consecutive headshots. The player base is a toxic stew of tryhards, trolls, and weirdly aggressive newbies who’d rather flame you for picking Engineer on offense or for running a back burner Pyro than, say, actually play the objective.  Oh you wanted to play as a sniper?  You're going to have to run that past ""冰雪Ice snow"" who is playing his preferred class, but takes issue with you doing the same, k thx.

Then there’s the gameplay, where the meta hasn’t evolved since the Bush administration. You’ve got players clinging to strategies so outdated they might as well be written on parchment. “Just stack five Heavies on the payload,” says MedicMain69, with the unshakable confidence of a flat-earther at a NASA convention. Meanwhile, the Spy mains are still trying to pull off the same knife trick they saw in a YouTube montage from 2012, oblivious to the fact that everyone’s got a PhD in paranoid back-checking by now. It’s not just that these players lack imagination it’s that they’re so smug about it. They’ll lecture you on why their 0-12 Scout run was “tactical” while you’re busy capturing the point solo.

Most of the tactics around the weapons were learned from a YouTube video from 10 years ago but the game has since changed, just these morons keep insisting to ""crouch in front of the tank and shoot up with the phlog!"" Without realizing that you can do more damage over time with literally any other flamethrower from the side.  ""bUt mY fAvOrItE tWiTcH StReAmEr sAiD sO!!"" is their only retort.  If they'd only play the game instead of watching someone else play the game...

And don’t get me started on the “geniuses” who think spamming “Need a dispenser here!” while standing in spawn is a personality trait. The confidence-to-competence ratio in TF2 is off the charts. You’ll see a Demoman sticky-trap his own team’s spawn door, wipe the squad, and then have the gall to call you a noob for not “predicting” his galaxy-brain play. It’s like watching a toddler proudly present you with a crayon drawing of a war crime.

Have I told you about the players who are so good they require an entire team of ""expert players"" to win?  Yep.  Sure fire way to tell you're on a quality server is the guy named ""Gregarious"" crying about how his entire team is worthless (except him, of course).  He's the best phlog pyro that ever lived to helplessly watch the bomb be delivered.  You can sense this occurs on every server this ""Greg"" joins.

The game itself? Still fun, in a masochistic, “I guess I’ll play one more round” kind of way. The mechanics are tight, the classes are iconic, and the art style is timeless. But Valve’s neglect has left TF2 feeling like a haunted amusement park: creaky, understaffed, and overrun by gremlins who think they’re running the show. Bots still plague servers, updates are rarer than a polite voice chat, and the hat economy is somehow more stable than crypto.

In short, Team Fortress 2 is a paradox: a masterpiece of game design dragged down by a player base that’s equal parts toxic, stubborn, and dumber than a sack of hammers. If you can stomach the cesspool of humanity and laugh at the absurdity of it all, it’s still worth a spin.

Instead of encouraging the individual to host their own servers or join others, Valve chooses to take the bandwidth and discourage community servers by filtering traffic. 
Where then players are greeted by bots, unbalanced teams or 10 minute matches that nobody gets to stay in after. The threat of bots is always alive as long as Valve continues to funnel the majority of tf2's playerbase into their own servers, where they do little to no moderation.

Valve should bring back the ability to select teams, in order to keep games balanced. Valve should also bring back the quickplay system. It kept both Valve servers and dedicated community servers populated. And matches within community servers are allowed to go on for hours, meaning you can play on the same map/gamemode to your heart's content.

Honestly, this is one of the best comeback stories in gaming. Night City is stunning, the combat is finally tight, and the story actually sticks with you. If you’ve been holding off since launch, it’s finally the masterpiece it was meant to be.

1091500,True,"I’m not a fan of games like GTA V that are labeled as open-world but still feel heavily restricted. In GTA V, the world is big, but most interactions feel shallow, you can drive anywhere, cause chaos, and follow the main story, but outside of that, your choices rarely matter. The city feels more like a backdrop than a place that reacts to you.

That’s why I avoided Cyberpunk 2077 for so many years. I assumed it would be the same kind of “open world for the sake of size” experience. I was wrong.

Cyberpunk’s Night City feels alive. Side quests aren’t just filler; they’re often better written than the main story in other games. Your choices actually change how characters treat you, how missions unfold, and sometimes how entire storylines end. You’re not just moving through the world — you’re shaping your version of it.

Once I started playing, I couldn’t stop. The atmosphere, the characters, and the storytelling stayed in my head even when I wasn’t playing.

The open world and atmosphere are strong, but the quests are dull. It feels like a short movie stretched thin to fill a game. Nothing you do in gameplay affects the story. By the end I was a one man army, yet Rogue still told me she had no work because of my “bad reputation” from one failed scripted gig.

The only time the game acknowledges your strength is after the secret ending which, for my full melee build, felt like any other mission: 11 minutes of fighting wrapped in an hour of talking.

In the end, the game looks better than it plays. If you want atmosphere and cutscenes, you might enjoy it, but if you expect meaningful choices, or real player agency, it still falls short.",1767596203,3139.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

What put me off?  It felt more like an interactive story.  I was mostly a passenger for those five hours.  The driving on a keyboard was not good at all.  The game was quite dark, making it hard for me to figure out what was going on in combat.

I started like 8 or 9 playthroughs (on the 4th different gaming PC now since the game released lol) in the last 5 years. And today, I FINALLY finished the Phantom Liberty storylines as well now.

And damn, some of the endings hit really hard. Great storytelling and emotional bonding with the characters.
While the credits rolled I felt ""empty"" like I did with Clair Obscure Expedition 33. 
Only a handful of games have *that* impact on me.

And we remember: 
Cyberpunk had a rough start at release, and while it was a Nvidia tech showcase very often, it now (Patcth 2.3 with Phantom Liberty content) became one of the best RPG gaming experiences ever, with easily 150+ hours of content if you play it the first time and try out the different endings.
They went from 70% bad reviews to 90% positive ones. That's a redemption arc if anything.

To be honest: Cyberpunk still is not perfect, not even close.
The two biggest negative aspects I personally found: 
1. The world's atmosphere and setting are great, but there are not really interactive encounters or ways and stuff to ""explore"". There are some eastereggs and neat lorepieces all over the world and some quests, but RDR2 and GTA V are on another level here.

2.) The illusion of choice: Only few decisions really matter , so it is not a ""real"" oldschool RPG

To bend it positively: There *are* some crucial choices that are fundamental for making Cyberpunk so replayable.
On top of that some side quests and missions are perfectly crafted, don't ignore those. And just be aware, there is some missable content if you do not get the timing of the quests triggers right. But that's a pro argument for another replay :)

TLDR: 
Today I finally finished all ~ 300 missions + jobs + gigs + NCPD stuff in one ""final"" run that I started over the last 2 months
And my verdict is this: 
CDPR did their part to push the boundaries of PC gaming; they did stuff wrong at release, they reworked content, they fixed the issues and delivered us a masterpiece of gaming.
It is a 10 of 10 game for me despite some flaws .
And it won't be my last run, mods are next I guess.

I would love to play Cyberpunk 2 in the future, they have the setting and the lore and the experience to deliver this. After Witcher 4 I guess :D

I bought Cyberpunk 2077 five years ago and tried to play it on a PS4 Pro. It was… rough. Playing a shooter on a console already felt awkward, but on top of that the game was buggy and had serious performance issues. I dropped it.

Fast forward five years. New PC, RX 9070 XT, an OLED gaming monitor—and wow. What a comeback.

Cyberpunk 2077 today is an absolute masterpiece. 10/10.

I’ve completed both the main story and the Phantom Liberty DLC, and I’m honestly blown away. If you’re going to play this game, play it with the DLC—this is where the storytelling reaches another level entirely. The final mission genuinely brought tears to my eyes. The characters live in moral gray zones, there are no easy answers, and your decisions actually matter.

The music is phenomenal. So good that I regularly listen to the official playlist while driving in real life—it just sticks with you.

Gameplay is incredibly satisfying. It fully immerses you in the fantasy of becoming an unstoppable, cyber-enhanced killing machine, while still making you feel the weight of every choice you make. Power and consequence exist side by side, and that balance is rare.

1091500,False,"Visually the game is exceptionally good and the city has an amazing flair. The gameplay is decent. If this is what you are looking for, it is a great game.

But for me it is not the masterpiece that some people seem to see, because the story and the characters are mostly bland. I would go with a neutral rating, but as I personally think this is important for a Role Playing Game, [b]I focus my review soley on the story and characters[/b] and give it a negative rating. If this was a movie it would be one of those Marvel movies with amazing visuals, but you won't watch them for their plot.

Obviously, the following explanation contains mild spoilers.

[h3]The reason to hate Arasaka, the main story antagonist, is not communicated.[/h3]

You are doing jobs for other corpos, the government and violent gangs. Jackie, your best friend, is still associated with a local gang. There are enough reasons to hate the gangs or other corpos, because you see them do evil in side quests. But the game does not show you why you should hate Arasaka. From what you see, they seem to be the sheep amongst wolves. Meanwhile your character does not have a moral problem wearing cyberwear from Arasaka or other corps. This makes it hard to be hate Arasaka as a player and understand characters motivations.

[h3]There are too many characters without depth.[/h3]

98% of named characters you meet are nothing more than a one-line description from a tabletop RPG. 

Take Regina Jones for example. She is an ex media person with an eyepatch that made it her mission to help cyberpsychos. That's what you learn the first time you meet her and you won't learn anything else after doing 25 missions for her. 

Or Viktor Vektor, your local ripperdoc. The game wants to establish him as a caring father figure. He calls first after finishing the main story. But all I know of him is that he is a nice guy and a former boxer who lives in the neighborhood and calls me sometimes during main missions. 

It would have been better to have less characters with more depth instead. Notable exceptions are the 4 potential love interests and a car.

[h3]Suspending disbelief is hard at times.[/h3]

Johnny seems to know everything and explains the world to V eventhough he has been locked away for the last 50 years and can't see anything that V does not. Why is he so certain that NC is still the same as back in his time? Why should I trust him to give me an accurate view of the world? 50 years changed quite a lot in our timeline. 

Also 50 years after his death, Bartmoss' hacks are supposed to still be better than anything. Has technology not evolved? Has no corporation analysed his hacks and learned from them? 

I understand that most of this is fan service. But still it goes above credibility at times.

[h3]When taking certain decisions, the main story is hard to follow.[/h3]

Let me give two examples. 

First: When you do a job for the Voodoo Boys, you meet someone from Netwatch at the end. I had to search the internet what Netwatch and three other things were, because this was the first time it came up in the game and it seemed important. As in-character I had no reason to believe this guy I knocked him out early in our conversation. After that I went unconcious and woke up at a different spot. I had no clue why that happened, because the game did not give an explanation even later on. Had I heard the netwatch guy out, I would have understood what happened. But why does the game give an option to knock him out early, if this skips an important part of the main story? 

Second: I went for the secret ending first. When I had to make the final decision, I was lost. 50 hours in-game earlier someone explained what the plan there was, but I could not remember it. This felt unsatisfying, as the game ended and I had no clue what I just did. There are other endings, that give the same decision, but they give a wrap up before. But if you choose this path, you won't get it.

[h3]Decisions are irrelevant.[/h3]

Adding to the point above, the game gives options sometimes, that seem relevant, but have no relevance. It has been critisized often, but choosing your background changes the first hour of gameplay, but nothing beyond that. You can also directly decide if you trust Johnny or not in the last mission from the same savegame. How you acted towards him earlier in the game does not really matter. These design decisions by the developers have the consequences that many things have to be vague throughout the game. But this also makes it harder to relate for me as a player, because V and Johnny have to be everything and nothing at the same time.

I have the feeling it would have been better to be more railroaded in a way similar to RDR2, where you have less direct decisions, but your decisions throughout the game decide how your character develops and what ending you get. This might have led to a better story arc, where you feel your relation with Johnny improve over time if you trust him. But as it is, he feels like a pita the whole time and I never came to a point where I understood his intentions.

All in all, this game feels as if most of the story and character work was invested in Act 1, which is about 6 hours long. After that story telling and character design degrades.",1767536692,6921.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.5172414183616638

1091500,True,"This game has Keanu Reeves, which makes the game breathtaking in the first place. Just look at my profile picture. Anyways, into the actual review:

Cyberpunk 2077 is easily one of the best games of the decade, and probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time right alongside CD Projekt Red's other big title, The Witcher 3. Going into this game, I really wasn't expecting much. I played The Witcher series right before this and loved it, and had the mindset that this game was going to be good but not close to my love for The Witcher 3. Now, 138 hours later and chromed up like a true gonk, I can confidently say this game is neck and neck with The Witcher 3. I understand that this game had countless issues upon release, I even remember calling before this game's release that there was going to be a catastrophic release, but considering how the issues with this game were mostly with the bugs and not the story/gameplay in the first place, how could I not love this game now. I honestly think this game has some of the best writing, characters, and captivating stories of all time in a game. Not to mention that the world building is extraordinary. The devs at CD Projekt Red have always done an amazing job at transporting you into the world of the game, and Cyberpunk 2077 is no exception. There were genuinely times that I was playing the game and I had to stop and just say, ""yuck."" Such a good job at making you realize the gravity of the corruption in this dystopia. This game also continues CD Projekt Red's trend of great DLC, and Phantom Liberty miiiiight be my favorite DLC in a game, or at least very high up there. It miiiight even be better than the base game, which is saying a lot from my experience with the base game. The score is also great, and can really set the vibe for the scene.

Anyways, there is not much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. If you haven't given this game a chance, I highly suggest doing so. I recognize that there are some parts of the game that people don't like much and some promises that CD Projekt Red didn't really follow through on (V's customization could've been much better), but my experience with this game is one of the best I have ever had.

So, choom, chrome up.

I remember the hype surrounding this game before it released. I remember the mess it was, the disappointment, the refunds.

But CDPR did not stop there. Over the years, the game improved. Content was added, features delivered, bugs fixed. In time, a DLC was released, expanding the game even further.

I bought the game during a sale, on a whim. It landed in my backlog, like so many other titles.
Friends and family members played the game and urged me to give it a try.

And so I did. In summer 2025, I arrived in Night City. And for the coming months, I played nothing else.

In short, this game is undoubtedly a masterpiece.
It oozes atmosphere, the world feels so very much alive and you, the player, so very much a part of it.
The storytelling - the story itself - is simply brilliant. I don't remember a game in which I felt so utterly invested, in which I just wanted to know what happens next. It pulls you in and never lets go.

The soundtrack is outstanding. I have added so many tracks to my personal playlist I lost count.

The DLC adds just so much. A new area, a gripping spy movie-like storyline, new endings, items, side missions. Do yourself a favor and always grab the Ultimate Edition, if you can. It is worth every cent you spend on it.

I played the game exclusively on my Steam Deck.
Graphically, it looks amazing and is terrifingly well optimized. Of course, if you seek to enjoy the horrors and beauty of Night City in all their glory, you should use a more capable system.
Technically, I still encountered some very minor bugs and experienced in total three crashes. Nothing game-breaking, nothing too annoying.

All in all, I loved every second I spent in Night City. I did almost everything there is to do.
For now, I need a break. But I have already planned my second playthrough, what my V should look like, what I will do differently next time. It is one of those games, you can play again and again and again, like a more modern Skyrim.

1091500,True,"For one of the most anticipated the games of an entire generation, this game had a textbook example of a bad launch. From barely being able to stand on its own two feet on the current consoles at the time, to game breaking bugs that didn't even allow the story to be finished, it was a total disaster. 

As a younger teenager when this game launched, I never had much to my name for games. I admit that I bought into the hype around launch day, and even got an early Christmas gift of steam gift cards to get this game not long after launch. I was so excited, and it made my Christmas break. I spent a whole weekend that break just playing through the game's main story, I was excited to see all the endings that were mentioned in the media circus. As soon as I managed to get through the story, I finally let myself see the lambasting that came from the critics and the general public alike. The game stopping issues I mentioned before were mentioned so much, and it hurt me to see a game that I really enjoyed get beaten down so hard. I never saw those launch day issues, and religiously updated every patch out of fear of losing my progress. Granted, my pc was far from even the minimum specs to truly play this game properly at launch. Running an old AMD FX4300 and a Radeon R9 290X in 2020 definitely showed the age of the computer. This game definitely made it hurt, I managed to just barely squeak by with low settings for everything. Now those of you in the know about those specs, you're likely thinking ""Yeah of course you weren't getting top tier gameplay."" Stuttering, barely reaching 30FPS, and overall games not looking the best were a normal occurrence for that computer, and Cyberpunk was no exception. Despite that, I still played on. I spent many hours trucking through with those specs.

I finally got a hand-me-down computer from a family member that managed to surpass the minimum specifications to run the game. It was amazing to see this game run better than I had every personally seen before. I had saved my pennies for the year to get a GTX 1660 super to pair with the i7-6700k and 16GB of ram. I also got the game on an SSD which was leagues of difference compared to the old 5400RPM mechanical hard disk I shucked from an external storage device years prior. Of course, with these performance increases, I also witnessed more of those game breaking bugs people used to talk about at launch. It definitely turned the computer into a space heater as well, those older EVGA GPU's love to run HOT! Despite all these factors though, my spirit and love for this game wasn't trampled. I continued to keep playing, getting more achievements to feed the young completionist I've since grown to become. 

With the release of Phantom Liberty, I found a new love. I had been on the usual bimonthly hiatus from playing, and yet I found myself just as excited as that young lad was leading up to Christmas break. There definitely were issues, just like the game release, but I would say it certainly was a lot better than the initial release. The DLC was actually able to be completed fully on launch day. Needless to say, I was beyond ready to dive back into this game. 

I have been a big proponent for game modding on PC for as long as I have had one to call my own. I am proud that I was a smart enough kid to not ruin the family computer with viruses from sketchy Minecraft mod sites. It is always a treat to see the new things the modding community has cooked up whenever I return from my hiatuses. I like to think it's one of the reasons I just keep coming back. It is good to see a community so actively engaged and always creating new things to share between each other, and even the lowly leeches like me who couldn't 3D model clothing or a car to save my life.

The story of this game is a masterpiece. Do some missions feel repetitive and have less replayability than others? Absolutely, nobody can make a perfect product that can please everyone and their mothers. Do I still find myself replaying those missions? That is another resounding yes. Yes they may just be regular old filler to some, but I find the tedium and mundanity of those missions to be soothing. 

The phrase ""No happy endings in Night City"" is all too true. After achieving every ending to satisfy that same completionist, I can confidently say that some of them were actually painful to achieve. Making decisions leading to otherwise terrible outcomes is not something I find myself doing very often, and when these ""bad"" endings hit you, they hit you like a train. They'll go right for the jugular for decisions leading up, and kick straight to the gut to finish you off. I will admit it took me a good couple years to get 100% completion. Between the release of Phantom Liberty adding more endings and more to achieve, and the struggle to get through the ""bad"" endings, I took my time. 

As I write now, currently on the back end of another hiatus, I felt confident enough to finally write this review. It's hard for me to discuss how I feel about of a lot of things, but I can in good confidence say that I have talked up this game so much to people I know and don't know alike. Looking back through with a slightly less rose tinted pair of glasses, I see flaws. Is the game perfect? Far from it, there's still plenty of bugs going around and a few things that I still have hopes for some change, even in the smallest of patches. Even so, I still recommend this game to anyone and everyone who asks me about it. 

With rumors of another season of the anime around the corner, and a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 somewhere in the development cycle, I'm sure I'll still get enjoyment from this game for years to come.

For those of you that read through my rambling, I thank you. If you find yourself looking for that last nudge to push you into buying or even just trying to get back into this masterpiece, by all means treat this review as that nudge. For those who haven't bought it yet, do. I cannot recommend it enough, especially during big steam sales when you can get the game and dlc bundled nicely. For those of you who have the game and maybe were disappointed with the game at launch because of its many fatal flaws who wrote it off, I implore you: Try it again!

1091500,True,"Fantastic RPG with a thrilling and engaging story about runaway capitalism in a world that will suck you in with its depth and intrigue, I was always looking for more notes and world news so I could learn more of the setting. This game is probably one of the most beautiful games you can run on modern PC’s, the neon lights, reflections smoke and futuristic cityscapes all work together so well to create a truly amazing visual sight. If you just got a new computer this is the game to break it in with!.

The DLC is an amazing addition, adds an alternative start that helps bypass the old intro allowing for much easier replayability. The DLC story blends well with the main story and is as well produced and a blast to play. It's like a much more succinct and shorter main campaign with as much payoff, if not more because you become attached and closer with the characters in the short DLC compared to the characters you meet in a less contained, longform way in the main story. I also enjoy that the DLC slots into the “middle” of your adventure and you continue on playing after finishing unless choosing some specific endings, makes it feel much more cohesive compared to just being TP’ed to some new zone completely isolated from the greater game world. It feels like an actual chapter in the characters life instead of just a convenient way to add more content to the game.

1091500,True,"Story:

The story of this game is extremely enticing and customizable. Even at the start you can choose your characters upbringing, and in the ones I chose the initial hook really got me to continue playing, and throughout the game there are many paths you can take that will effect the outcome  in the end, which is always captivating and has really cool effects on the credits.

Gameplay:

The gameplay offers a lot of variety and was done really well also. There are many builds you can take, and while some are definitely better than others, you won't feel like you are really struggling or that yours is underwhelming most of the time. The way the builds are done might be confusing or overwhelming for some because of all the things you need to take into consideration (mostly for netrunner builds), but as someone who used that build for my runs it really wasn't that bad.

Performance:

You definitely need an at least average computer for this game, but it runs pretty decently in my opinion. It's a lot better than it was on release, so don't let all the bad things you heard about it from then turn you off of it. The setting are very generous so you can easily make your system run the game at a capacity you want while still making the game beautiful in most cases.

Conclusion:

Cyberpunk 2077 by CD Prokekt Red had a rough release, mostly due to it being unlike things the studio has done in the past, but through many patches has become an all time favorite of mine. The story is captivating, the gameplay is thrilling, and the customization and choices make it feel fresh throughout.

1) for some reason despite having decent pc by any chance you are getting stuttering here is a quick fix which i found it helped me a lot 
[u] Head over to your graphics settings,
set default settings (Just to be safe also set your display setting to default )
Close and relaunch the game &Customize your settings.[/u]


2) Now something related to games got little spoiler:-
(a) If anyone going for Platinum i would recommend get both Base game and DLC( [spoiler] base game got skill cap of 50 and PL DLC got 60 [/spoiler])
(b) dont focus right or wrong choice just  enjoy the game 
(c) by any means dont try those tricks to bypass their launcher since many times it may block your achievements 
(d)Last espicially for achievements like City related ( watson / CorpoPlaza/Westbrook etc ) =[spoiler] You can technically complete this achievement early ACT 2 most probably if im not wrong which require NCPD gigs and those area fixers like sabre , wakako, Regina etc if it doesnt pop up after doing all NCPD and Fixers quest Make sure you complete all cyberpsychos and Rogues GIG are required to complete so dont panic [/spoiler]

3) enjoy the game there are tons of things to explore it is now much better than what it used to be when it was initially launched and yes you may encounter some old bugs like falling though maps but dont worry those are minor it wont cause any problem 

Hope this help anyone enjoy and happy gaming :)",1767478150,7042.0,True,False,False,2,1,0.5454545617103576

1091500,True,"After 25 hours, I can safely say that Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t just a game you play; it’s a place you inhabit. While the launch was legendary for the wrong reasons, the game I’m playing now is a masterclass in atmosphere, storytelling, and ""style over substance"" (though there’s plenty of substance here too). Night City is easily the most detailed urban environment ever put in a game. At 25 hours, I’ve stopped using fast travel. I’d rather drive my Kusanagi bike through Japantown at night, watching the neon reflect off the wet asphalt. Every district—from the corporate glitz of City Center to the rusted decay of Pacifica—feels distinct and lived-in.

Final Thought: If you’re looking for a digital playground that respects your time and offers a dark, mature story, Night City is calling. Just don't expect a happy ending—this is Cyberpunk, after all.

1091500,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a highly controversial blockbuster that stumbled out of the gate but made a stunning comeback later. After multiple updates and the release of its DLC Phantom Liberty, it has evolved into a benchmark for cyberpunk-themed games, ideal for story-driven players and world-building enthusiasts.
 
Core Highlights
 
- Immersive Worldbuilding: The neon-lit streets, cybernetic enhancements, and holographic advertisements of Night City create a top-tier cyberpunk atmosphere, with exceptionally high-quality Chinese voice acting that takes immersion to the next level.

- Compelling Narrative & Characters: The symbiotic consciousness struggle between V and Johnny Silverhand is intensely gripping. Multiple endings are influenced by side quests, with key side stories featuring rich plots and movie-grade cutscenes.

- Revamped Gameplay & Updates: The 2.0 update overhauled skills, cyberware, and combat, enabling diverse playstyles (hacker, stealth, melee, etc.). The DLC Phantom Liberty boasts outstanding quality, with significantly improved optimization.

- Stunning Visuals & Music: Enhanced by ray tracing, the game delivers breathtaking graphics, especially shining in rainy nights and nightclub lighting effects. The electronic soundtrack perfectly fits the setting, amplifying the immersive experience.
 
Key Shortcomings
 
- Sense of Content Incompleteness: The main storyline is relatively short, with a large number of ""cookie-cutter"" gigs padding the open world, and some area designs failing to reach their full potential.

- Lack of Combat Depth: Once players master their preferred playstyle in the late game, combat becomes overly easy; AI and stealth mechanics are relatively simplistic, leading to a drop in challenge.

- Lingering Legacy Issues: Despite fixes for the disastrous bugs and poor optimization at launch, minor glitches still persist. Some systems (such as the police mechanism) remain poorly designed.",1767445861,7767.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

While it is incredibly versatile, incredibly buggy and visually stunning it still in my eyes remains as a pretty cookie cutter 'Action-RPG' with nothing too interesting to boot. 

An very vast and in-depth character creator and customization system...for a 95% first-person experience. Most you will see of your character besides during driving is with the shadows which are less than stellar.

The story branching into these multiple paths with your choices impacting the ending is not played smoothly. This isn't even to boot how the romantic options in the game are both limited and very stupid from a story perspective.

None of the games systems were explained well enough for me to take full advantage of them during the course of my gameplay.

1091500,True,"Story:
The main story is compelling and full of twists, featuring deep characters and choices that significantly impact the endings. Dialogues are carefully crafted, and every choice feels meaningful, making replaying the game to explore different outcomes highly enjoyable.

Side Quests:
Side quests are diverse and often tied to the main story. They’re more than just filler – whether exploring the city or engaging in character-specific missions, each quest makes you feel like part of a living, breathing world.

Cities and Open World:
Night City is breathtakingly detailed and full of life. Each district tells its own story: from luxurious neon-lit areas to dark, dangerous streets teeming with gangs. The open world ensures that exploration is consistently rewarding and engaging.

Characters:
Characters are excellent and realistic, each with a unique personality. They evolve naturally throughout the story, and your interactions with them leave a tangible impact on the narrative.

Expansion – Phantom Liberty:
The expansion adds a new dimension to the game with an exciting storyline, thrilling missions, and new characters. Phantom Liberty complements the base game perfectly, providing extra value for players who’ve already invested significant time in Cyberpunk 2077.

Conclusion:
For fans of large, detailed games, Cyberpunk 2077 with Phantom Liberty delivers a rich, immersive experience. Whether you focus on the story, exploration, or side quests, you’ll be entertained throughout. This is a game that’s worth every hour spent.

The game rewards slowing down and paying attention more than rushing from objective to objective.

I also love how open it all feels. You can get lost in the city without feeling like you are playing it wrong. Some nights you follow the story. Other times you just drive, explore, or take on a small job that turns into something bigger.

1091500,True,"I haven't played many games, but this one is a masterpiece. The graphics, the storyline, and the choices that seem innocent at first leave a deep mark.
It is a masterpiece how the developers were able to show players the sad reality of the city of dreams in such a short campaign.
Of course, I completed the entire game—including all the side quests—so there was nothing left to do except... make a few final decisions.

As I played the game, I allowed myself to become completely absorbed by the city, its problems, and the widespread consumerism.
This means that all the choices I made were in harmony with myself, or due to... the requirement to make a bad or wrong decision.
I played in my own style – you made a decision? Deal with the consequences – don't reload previous checkpoints.

The end of the game left me emotionally devastated for two days. 
Did I really do everything right? Was there really no other way out? Was it all just about... ?

To sum up. The game put me in various situations. Sometimes I laughed out loud, sometimes I clenched my fists, and once I had to go for a walk to think over my decision.
I recommend everyone to let themselves be “devoured” by the city of dreams.

1091500,False,"With around 200h put into this game I can't deny that it is entertaining and it has many positives, enough so to make me want to see it through to the end. That said, I got frustrated with many aspects of the game, to the point where I quit playing it twice for several months at a time because I didn't want to deal with the annoying parts. Without going into too much detail:
- Music and sound design are the worst part about the game. I understand there are probably many people who enjoy the music in this game, but that is certainly not my case. Almost certainly the worst music of any game I've played, and the fact that it's blasting from everywhere all the time meant I ended up spending way too much time turning off radios and shooting TVs just to try to make it stop.
- Driving mechanics: cumbersome and frustrating, making it difficult to fully enjoy the beautifully designed cityscape. It’s a shame, because the environment is impressive, but the poor vehicle controls (especially by car) hinder exploration.
- Difficulty: even at hardcore difficulty, the game becomes too easy in the late stages, especially with certain perks (I wasn't following any guides, just to be clear). By mid to late game, having done many of the side missions, I found myself being too OP to make most boss encounters feel really challenging. I only remember a couple of encounters where I died multiple times, both in Phantom Liberty.
- Plot complexity: the storyline is original and interesting, but way too often I found myself feeling quite lost with many of the characters and concepts that were being discussed. Admittedly I knew nothing about the cyberpunk lore before playing the game and the genre itself isn't one I'm too interested in, but an in-game glossary of characters and important concepts would have made things much better for me.
- Bugs & Stability: I never played it before the 2.0 update, but even in 2025 persistent bugs still hamper the enjoyment and immersion. All the time I would have identical npcs spawn multiple times in the same space, I wonder if that would have happened if I had a more potent gaming setup.
- I tried playing a pacifist who almost never killed their enemies unless I had to or unless they were unambiguously evil, but the game basically doesn't care about that except for the cyberpsycho missions (and even then the only difference is how much you get paid).
- Endings: frankly one of the worst things for me, both at the end of the main story and the dlc I felt like none of the options I could choose from made sense for my character. The game gives an illusion of freedom of choice but too many times I found myself not having the option to choose the route that I would have wanted. Especially frustrating was the fact that the only ending that would have more or less made sense for me (the secret ending) was locked behind a very specific set of answers the game never hints about having a significant impact on the plot.",1767374265,12002.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4347825944423675

The problem with rating a game on Steam is that it is a Yes or No. Perhaps they should implement a ""Meh"" button too?

Overall, I felt that the game lacked anything beyond progressing through the story, occasionally taking a break from it to do side missions.

I did sometimes enjoy taking in the city views and the wonderful vistas I came across during my gameplay. I also appreciated the Easter eggs and cameo appearances like Nina Kraviz, Hideo Kojima, and others.

[h3] What people say about this game [/h3]

I read reviews before buying the game on sale a year ago and decided to give it a go. Most reviews were overwhelmingly positive, with players saying that this is THE GREATEST GAME and that THE DEVELOPERS REDEEMED THEMSELVES. I do not mind people loving this game and expressing their positive feelings about it. However, I feel like they are giving this game too much credit for what it actually is. The game is also still infested with bugs, even in side quests or fixer missions. For a game that has had massive updates, they still failed to keep it clean.

So I do not really get why people are calling this game truly great.

[h2] The Story and the Game [/h2]

No spoilers here, but story-wise I felt rather impartial about what the story was about, as it mostly revolves around tech talk, stealing the latest tech from big corporations, chips, implants, and similar themes. I did have fun playing fixer missions and side quests, and I appreciated the Easter eggs and encounters with famous faces.

The story itself is about V, the character you play. No matter which path you select at the beginning, it leads you to the same point. You are simply a mercenary doing jobs for fixers, trying to make it big in Night City. The only real difference lies in having some additional dialogue options.

I would not say there is much to this game beyond its side quests and stories. CDPR advertised a game centered around a massive city with overpromised world depth. While Night City looks impressive, it lacks reactive systems. This game is as wide as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle. Yes, that phrase is a reference to another infamous game with a horrible launch.

[h3] The illusion of choice and the shallow RPG system [/h3]

The game advertises itself as an RPG, but it is not. It only has a few RPG elements, such as limited dialogue choices when speaking to NPCs and leveling up to assign points to skills and attributes. The game is primarily about action. There are also no real consequences for the choices you make in the world, which makes everything feel indifferent. Your dialogue options and origin-specific dialogue have no meaningful impact on the world. At best, you get small advantages like increased rewards or the option to avoid combat, or engage in more combat, during certain encounters.

Your choices do not matter. NPC friends, contacts, fixers, and gang enemies do not react differently to you. For me, this is quite insulting when the game is marketed as an RPG.

Moment-to-moment gameplay feels serviceable, but rarely engaging. Gunplay works, but it lacks weight and tension, especially once you realize that most encounters can be handled in the same way regardless of your build. Enemies tend to behave predictably, and combat often turns into a straightforward shootout rather than something tactical or immersive.

No matter how you invest points into your skills, it does not truly support the type of build you are going for. You can usually break into any compound in any way you want, because there is almost always a missing fence, an open window, or a hatch that can be opened without needing high tech or brute-force skills. It is fine to offer multiple solutions, but when there is no real resistance, it raises the question of why builds matter at all.

Vehicle gameplay also feels inconsistent. Driving lacks weight, and vehicle combat feels clumsy and underutilized. For a game centered around a futuristic city, movement and traversal should feel exciting, but they often feel like a means to an end rather than an enjoyable part of the experience.

[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]

I do not think Cyberpunk 2077 is a terrible game, nor do I think it deserves the extreme praise it often receives. It is a visually impressive action game with some well-written side content, but it falls short of being the deep RPG experience it was marketed as. For me, it sits firmly in the middle. Not bad, not great, just a 5/10 experience that I finished without ever feeling truly engaged.",1767363966,7333.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.5

1091500,True,"I love this game. It's fun to play and it's not too difficult. You have to be prepared by upgrading your character in every way possible as you may get a long way into certain quests before realizing that you're not sufficiently prepared for for certain bosses and certain situations. Do this by doing all or at least a great number of the side missions available before following any main quests. Some missions are trick missions that are set up to get you into bad situations. They're fun to play but not what anyone really in the situation would take the risk of doing.

Some gameplay aspects can be quite annoying. The police are especially problematic in being very trigger happy. Example: I once set off from a parking spot and some idiot just decided to suddenly and randomly walk into my car and died. The police blamed me for that despite the fact I could do nothing about it and opened fire. Another example: I'm travelling not too quickly along a road and a policeman suddenly decides to use the crossing coming out of nowhere. I manage to stop before killing him or even injuring him. What does he do? He starts firing at me and calls in backup when I race off. The backup spam is ludicrous. Cars come out of nowhere. Sometimes I see them literally materializing in front of me and very frequently see them doing so on the mini-map as I drive along.  After a ridiculous chase of over a kilometre, blowing up police cars and killing every policeman who joins in the hunt I finally managed to escape. I walked back over the distance I'd travelled. The number of police and civilians who were killed during that chase was massive. The entire distance was full of burnt-out vehicles and dead bodies. It would've made international news. It was great fun to play but entirely unrealistic. If the policeman had been more reasonable, no-one would've died, no cars would've been damaged, and no news outlets would've known anything had happened. That's only a criticism because the game purports to try to be realistic. Such a response would be expected from criminals, but they don't have the infinite resources of the police.",1767358509,48357.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

1091500,True,"2077的灾难时期我没有经历过，我是从2.31开始玩的，玩了几十个小时，除了非常偶尔出现路上的车突然自爆的情况以外好像没见什么影响体验的BUG。

游戏确实很上瘾，很久没有这么上瘾过了，之前令我这么上瘾的还是辐射3、上古卷轴5这种ARPG，地图非常大，任务非常多，我玩的最高难度开局，人物成长比较平滑，技能点还可以随便洗（如果属性点也能洗就更牛逼了）。特别是潜行这块（最高难度不得不玩潜行啊），它设计得就像细胞分裂、耻辱这类潜行游戏一样好，不仅有各种机关、暗道，还得利用黑客技能吸引敌人什么的，真的就得好好思考怎么去破解关卡。最高难度的经验和金钱收益也非常可观，基本上一个任务就可以升一级，快速升级获得技能点，钱又可以去买武器装备，就可以切换成你喜欢玩的别的流派了。

如果说让我不够满意的，就是义体词缀系统，升级才能换词缀，而且词缀搭配那么多，数值范围又那么大，要投入太多的资金和时间进去了。如果说是升级的时候选择要替换的某一个词条，而不是3个全部打乱重新选还差不多，这样升级3次就可以把3个词条全部换掉了。然后再加入一个提升词缀数值的功能，喂相应阶级的材料就能把例如原来的3的近战伤害提升到4，然后逐步提升到7.5满值。另外词缀根据不同的部位应该也有合理的选项，比如表皮和骨骼应该是偏防御的，手臂手掌应该是偏攻击的，腿部应该是偏移动的，不然一个劲地堆攻击，太无脑了",1767326695,4876.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,True,"I have ca.270 hours in game and currently going through Phantom liberty, played the main game once, this is my second time. Hopefully DEVS will read this. 
bad things first :
- after all this time, car handling and driving in general is still terrible, I at least expected Mafia or GTA style of driving.  Cannot remember if there are any main missions where i need to drive, but some (delivering cars) require it, and honestly it is PITA. Biggest downer of the game! Because when you have a one of very few good handling cars or bikes (bikes somewhat handles better), driving around and exploring or enjoying views, scenery and world feels like a really enjoyable thing to do in game. Most cars and bikes handle like they have no brakes. Transmission is jerky, and stopping on place is nearly impossible without handbrake - car immediately starts to either move forward or back, there is no time delay in between it. There are quick travel options, but ... as i said, to enjoy that world and just get lost in it, driving around in it is experience on its own.
- there are still bugs and glitches!! What i hate most - car calling -> car stays too far away, even though i stand on same road. Upon hopping on bikes - sometimes they just accelerate by itself and pass hundreds of meters before normal operation! Sometimes, car upon calling fall from sky (wtf?)
- why the hell do i have to clickity click continue when i start the game? Start it already!

Ok, those were the most annoying things, now the good parts - and damn, there would be a book written about it-
-gameplay, story, guns, shooting, stealth, cyberware and hacking, characters, world buildup... 
Honestly, this is a gem of a game. Even though the driving is pissing me off every time i am doing it, rest of game is marvelous, and might be the best games i played in my life, certainly one of the most influential. Main story is fresh, interesting, new, characters are well built and interesting, main world is stunning - hats off for creating such place. 
Besides driving, only one thing would make me happier - Cyberpunk movie.

1091500,True,"Just like the top gear ""but I like this"" meme, is there better games than Cyberpunk 2077? Hell yeah there is but I like Cyberpunk.

The gameplay pretty much what you make of it, I will say though to me I think the shooting is cheeks. It's not fun to shoot a guy at point blank in the face with a double barreled shotgun twice and him still not being dead because of [i] hurr durr implants [/i]

The gameplay is not what makes Cyberpunk 2077 great it is for me the atmosphere, the worldbuilding, the lore and to a lesser degree the story. 

The world in Cyberpunk feels disgustingly familiar, you might see the advertisement billboards featuring shemales with visible bulges and think ew where is the modesty? or wow there is so much neon and everyone is dressed like robotic pornstars talking with plenty of cringy slang but guess what? take a person from 1950 and drop them down in NYC and they would think those exact same thoughts as we do about Cyberpunk. This is why the atmosphere and world building is great, it is perhaps not realistic but it is immersive.

The story is okay, not amazing. The best thing about the story is the relationship between V and Johnny and how V goes from hating Johnny to actually quite liking him in the end(depending on your choices). Keanu does a good job of voicing the character and it helps in making Johnny not just occasional comic relief but also genuinely at times seem like a bit of a nutjob who's gone off the deep end. The side quests in the game are a very mixed bag as far as I'm concerned, some side quests are instant classics, some are more bland and boring and some are like an occasional beach episode in a seasonal anime that doesn't do much but is nice to see like reuniting Samurai for one final gig.

Storytelling That Feels Real‌
The moment I saw Johnny Silverhand’s ghost flicker in my vision, I knew this was no ordinary RPG. V’s struggle against the Relic chip isn’t just about survival—it’s a soul-shaking battle between humanity and technology. Side quests like ""Never Fade Away"" made me laugh, cry, and question what it means to be ""alive.""
Customization That Defines Me‌
Choosing the Street Kid lifepath shaped V’s grit, while my cyberware upgrades turned me into a walking experiment. Want to be a silent hacker or a bullet-spraying beast? The game lets you live out every cyberpunk fantasy.
World That Breathes‌
Night City isn’t a backdrop—it’s a character. Corporate ads taunt me in the rain, NPCs share secrets in back alleys, and every district pulses with its own rhythm. Here, I’m not just a player—I’m a citizen of a world that feels alive.

From a rough, buggy release, it rose like a phoenix into a visually breathtaking, deeply immersive masterpiece.
The story is mature, emotional, and gripping, with exceptionally well-written characters.
Playing as female V completely won me over — Cherami Leigh’s brilliant voice acting adds real depth and humanity.
Johnny Silverhand (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) is charismatic, abrasive, and surprisingly layered.
And Judy… beautifully written, emotionally grounded, and unforgettable.
These characters don’t just exist in the story; they stay with you.
Combat and progression are flexible and rewarding, even for someone who isn’t really into FPS games.
High replayability, meaningful choices, and multiple endings make every playthrough worthwhile.
Thanks to modders, the game has become even richer and more customizable.

1091500,True,"Cyberpunk grabbed me mainly because of its story. The narrative is flexible and surprisingly accommodating, letting you approach it in different ways depending on the kind of player you are. Characters feel distinct and well written, and that variety is what kept me going to the end. It never felt like I was being railroaded into a single “correct” way to experience the story, and that’s one of the game’s strongest assets.

Visually, it’s a mixed bag. The day and night cycle, lighting, rain, and reflections are genuinely impressive and do a lot of heavy lifting for immersion. Night City can look incredible under the right conditions. Outside of that, though, much of the world feels oddly blended together. Random NPCs are especially uninspired and forgettable, which makes the city feel less alive than it wants to be. That part is subjective, but it stood out to me more than once.

Achievements were another positive surprise. They’re mostly easy to obtain with a bit of grinding, and chasing them was actually fun rather than tedious. It gave me extra motivation to keep playing even when the pacing slowed down.

Now the rough parts. It’s 2026 and the game still crashes far more than it should. I’m running a high-end PC and still experienced crashes during missions and while free roaming, which kills momentum fast and leads to unnecessary frustration. Stability at this point should not be an issue, yet here we are.

Combat is another weak spot. Fights don’t feel particularly good or creative, and for a futuristic setting where everything is supposed to be interconnected and advanced, the lack of innovation is disappointing. Melee weapons like blades look cool but don’t deliver on their potential. There’s no real sense of impact or mechanical creativity. Older games like F.E.A.R., released decades ago, had weapons that felt genuinely inventive, such as guns that could pin enemies to walls using magnets. Here, nothing really stands out. Being able to choose your own playlist is nice, but that’s not innovation, it’s a reused idea.

In the end, I do like the game, and yes, I would recommend it. That said, it becomes repetitive after a while, and boredom sets in once the novelty wears off. I’m glad I finished it, but I’m equally glad it’s over.",1767289933,6067.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,True,"[b] Cyberpunk 2077 [/b] is an example of a game that truly got back on its feet over time. The gameplay feels smooth and stable, and moving through the world, combat, and character progression give a strong sense of control and freedom. Shooting feels satisfying, stealth works well, and the skill system lets you shape your playstyle without forcing one specific approach.

The biggest strength of the game is still the story and the way it is told. The main plot is engaging, but side missions often leave an even stronger impression. Many of them tell smaller, sometimes bitter stories that fit the harsh and unforgiving nature of Night City. The characters feel believable, with their own goals and problems, which makes them easy to remember and connect with.

Night City itself is easily one of the strongest parts of the game. The city impresses with its scale, atmosphere, and attention to detail. Each district has its own identity and rhythm, which makes exploration enjoyable even after many hours. The areas outside the city also work well, adding variety and offering a change of pace.

The game offers a huge amount of activities, contracts, and side content, so boredom is rarely an issue. In its current state, Cyberpunk 2077 is a very solid and polished experience that finally shows its true potential. For me, it is a clear thumbs up and one of those games worth coming back to.",1767283809,5161.0,True,False,False,8,0,0.6212121248245239

Playtime: ~240 hours

Pros:

World-Building: Cyberpunk 2077 truly shines in its world-building. As someone who loves dystopian futures—think Blade Runner or Judge Dredd—I was hoping for that classic mix of grim, tech-heavy urban landscapes, with towering mega-corporations, a hazy, polluted atmosphere, and flying cars. Unfortunately, you can’t drive a flying car here ☹, but the world is still vast and fascinating. You’ll enjoy driving through dense cityscapes, poor suburbs, and even some sparse desert areas. While the world isn’t quite as alive or dynamic as The Witcher 3 (CD Projekt Red’s masterpiece), there’s still so much to explore—from rogue AIs to empathic machines and unpredictable weapons. It’s a rich experience, even if it’s a bit more focused on tech and hacking than the pure dystopian thrill I initially hoped for.

Customization: The character customization options are a major highlight. While Cyberpunk 2077 is primarily a first-person shooter, it goes far beyond that. Whether you want to play as a sneaky cyber-ninja, a gun-blazing Autobot, or a cyber-psycho samurai, the game offers huge freedom in how you approach combat and quests. There are countless ways to tailor your character to fit your preferred playstyle, which makes each playthrough feel unique and rewarding.

Quests: One of the game’s strongest points. Besides the main storyline, there are numerous side quests that involve deeply developed characters, each with their own backstory, motivations, and goals. It’s your choice which quests to follow, and honestly, I found myself invested in almost every character. These quests give the game emotional depth, and I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the people I encountered.

Graphics: If your system can handle it, Cyberpunk 2077 is visually stunning. The ray-tracing effects are on par with games like Control, and the lighting, weather, and environmental effects are simply breathtaking. The world looks incredible, especially at night, when the neon lights and holographic advertisements really shine.

DLC – Phantom Liberty: The Phantom Liberty DLC refines the Cyberpunk experience in many ways. It tightens up the pacing, improves the overall structure, and offers some of the best quests in the game. The story is more compelling than the main game’s, and the new characters and settings blend seamlessly into the world. Honestly, it’s everything I was hoping the base game would be, but with more focus and polish.

Cons:

World Liveliness: While the world is detailed and expansive, it doesn’t quite feel as alive as I expected. NPCs can seem a bit static, and the dynamic interaction with the world isn’t as immersive as in The Witcher 3. It’s a great backdrop, but it doesn’t have the same level of immersion that makes a game truly feel ""alive.""

Performance Issues (Launch): My first experience with Cyberpunk 2077 was a bit of a letdown. The performance was poor, with low framerates and constant stuttering, especially while driving. There were also plenty of bugs—NPCs would pop in and out, and I’d occasionally lose characters entirely. After a series of patches, though, the game became much more stable. By 2025, when I decided to dive back in for Phantom Liberty, the performance had significantly improved, and I could finally experience the game as it was meant to be.

Audio: The music is decent but not remarkable. It serves its purpose in creating atmosphere but doesn’t have any standout tracks that I’d listen to outside the game. It’s functional but lacks the musical impact that The Witcher 3 had.

Final Verdict:

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that has a lot to offer, but it’s important to go in with realistic expectations. If you’re expecting another Witcher 3, you may be disappointed, but if you’re a fan of dystopian settings and futuristic tech, you’ll find plenty to enjoy. The character customization, side quests, and vast world are major strengths, and the new Phantom Liberty DLC really polishes the experience, proving that CD Projekt Red can deliver when they focus on refining their formula.

In the end, it’s not perfect, but it’s a solid, engaging game with a ton of potential. With the improvements made over time and the excellent DLC, Cyberpunk 2077 proves that it’s definitely worth your time. So, don’t compare it to The Witcher 3, enjoy it for what it is, and embrace the chaos of being a cyber-enhanced badass in Night City.

I’m happy to see that it improved a lot, and i’m happy that i bought it more later. The game makes you feel good in every play and has an amazing storyline.

The controls and gameplay mechanics is really easy to get used to, very addicting, and also fun. I couldn’t stop playing (or play another game instead) for days, i LOVE how you can make so much interesting and unique builds based on any play style you want. 

overall i liked….
- Silverhand's story and character progression (espescially in don’t fear the reaper and other endings, or how he fully trusts V towards the end)
- The vibe and atmosphere of Night City. Every part of night city feels so immersive, and very explorable.
- Combat Mechanics (like mentioned in the previous stuff i wrote)
- Side missions, every side mission is unique and memorable, VERY fun to play and has great stories.
- the WHOLE dlc itself. please get it. its so good and it enhances the story so much and has so much different stuff.

1091500,True,"Honestly despite of the issues with loading in my end, Cyberpunk 2077 has really redeemed itself in my eyes. 

I have only did one run of the game, and I chose the path that gave the most violence (aka Focusing on combat, and implants while taking the Solo Raid ending). A Katana and a Sandevistan implant really is overpowered...  like really overpowered. Katanas on most enemies can just lead to them dying in 2-3 hits. Flash and Thunderclap made it easy to approach, and finishers just made kill time even shorter for those poor gonks. For the majority of the open world, I would just hunt down either cyberpyschos or anyone with a yellow marker above their head. I would then cut them into bits. The gunplay was pretty good for me at least, but I rarely engaged in it unless I wanted too or wanted to force a chunk of 12 gauge into a gonk's head. However, this does mean that I sadly did not engage in much of the other gameplay elements such as quick hacking. Quick hacking is, from my Act I perspective, is interesting. However, I would say it leans towards more into the stealthier side if not to a single target focus side as, again from my Act I perspective, the quick hack can distract enemies which can lead to a grab and kill or a DoT effect. I honestly feel like being pure melee is way too fun, and strong to the point it undermines the other elements.

I would wish to say more about Night City as a whole, but my PC is not good at running Cyberpunk to a nice looking state. I battled with loading issues while driving. Streets were empty, people were like 24 polygons, and sometimes events were so delayed. Animation issues, etc. This made like all of the forced car chase missions (I hated these) extremely more awful. No sounds from me shooting the gun, and sometimes hits not registering. This is mostly a my issue, so don't let it take away from your thought of getting Cyberpunk 2077. Just be wary. Anyways, Night City is extremely big, and I would love to explore it. They have the slums, the abandoned districts, the suburbs, the rich areas, the ""capital center"", and the great unknown outside the city limits. It is a wonder to drive around. At least that stupid loading issue had one somewhat positive thing which was making streets empty for me to drive and take in the scenery. Outside of that, I love that each region also has their distinct culture (or thing) that makes them feel different. This is mainly seen from just looking at the gang who appears in the district as they are, for the most part, unique in their way. Hell even Night City as a whole has their own slangs. ""Choom"" has been engraved in my mind all because of Jackie.

Johnny Silverhand is such a great schizo bud to have especially towards the end. From their pure hatred to each other in the beginning, to now seeing eye to eye and choosing to sacrifice their own life (in a way) for each other if the other was in danger, Johnny and V's constant banter really characterized and made each other feel real and human. He was mostly the main reason why I wanted to get this game as he transforms from being this rebel against corpo tyranny who gave zero fucks to anyone (or just an asshole at that point), to again a human who has a rather complex drive to him... but also sometimes a bit of an asshole--

I am (probably) gonna watch the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime show now. Wish me luck as there will be no happy ending. For folks like them, it is the wrong city.",1767247006,2597.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Gameplay is a little boring, just go here do this then go there and do that most of the time. And the combat was also not very enjoyable until I tried the sandevistan and that was the most fun I had in combat, running laps around enemies and either stabbing them or headshotting at point blank.

I really enjoyed the clothing and riding around on Jackie's motorbike (which I used for the entire game). There were still quite a few bugs I found during my playthrough but not all that frequent and they were more funny, like a car clipping into the floor or the auto drive deciding to ram the car into a wall.

Solid game, pacing felt very slow but that might be because I did nearly every side mission. I would recommend it for the story but nothing else",1767232032,3075.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

[b] Plot - Everything is coherent, well-coordinated, and everything is explained at the right time. All the characters, the city, the atmosphere—it all just fits. [/b]

[b] Starting the game is a new adventure, your adventure.
Everything you do has consequences, with 7 different endings.

[b] Above all, the game isn't overdone; cars, AVs, and other electrical devices are designed as if they were actually supposed to exist in 2077. [/b]

[b] The views are beautiful. Imagine the wilderness, overlooking the entire city of technology, Night City. A city of violence, blood, corporations, and power.
You drive through the wilderness, gazing at the neon-lit Night City, next to who? Panam Palmer. I'm not surprised so many people are crazy about her, but only those who have played her will understand. [/b]

I'm not surprised the Polish dubbing turned out so well. [/b]

1091500,False,"I bought this far after it came out, I got this with phatom liberty.

And I find it not only boring but actively infuriating.

Transversing the environment:
You first have to be near enough a fast travel spot to travel to it, so you initially have to get there by foot or car, There is a car you can summon but for some reason this no longer works??? After Meeting Johnny this option is disabled??? So I have to run very long distances to get anywhere and quite often due to the vertically of some areas you are detoured constantly.

Bugs:
Johhny Silver hand just vanishes mid-sentence during scripted events, such as an elevator ride, the amount of times I am talking to him and he just poofs, I don't mean he fades out he just blinks out of existance???

Some enemies are invisible, this happens a lot, I don't mean you can see a simmer, I only know they are there due to muzzle flashes and the red dots on the radar. I cannot tell if this is a glitch or not.

It also keeps alerting enemies stating that they found a body despite having not even killing or knocking anyone out???

Boring aspects:
The cyber enhancements I can install are worthless, it is like increase movement speed by 35% when health is below 50% or increase health by +3.
The options are so limited and don't apply to the different playstyles, the only one that seemed to be an improvement was one that increased RAM but that was it, the ripperdoc stock didn't seem to refresh.
I understand that there might be better options later into the game but give me something that actually does something at least.

Most guns suck except the pistol, the rest did not do enough damage, so you have to land multiple headshots to kill anything, the submachine gun was especially sad, you could unload an entire magazine and only get a fourth of their health down, while 4 headshots from the pistol would kill them.
I tried the gun shop but they don't sell anything I don't already have???

Most enemies are kinda bullet sponges, have really good aim and do a lot of damage so despite the other play styles existing the only viable one is crouching behind cover. 

This means just makes it a cover shooter, I at least got a perk to take less damage in cover but it didn't seem to make any difference. But this is a boring way to play, I understand that later in the game I might be able to get powers to actually play how I want but why is this not an option from the start, why do I have to wait until the ""fun"" part??? And as skills level up as you use them it just delays the point were you can actually play that way???

They keep adding more and more characters all of which are boring or have the personality of a quest board. There is no funny characters so far just basically the same kinda person.",1767200004,598.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.4803149700164794

1091500,True,"Played on Lenovo Legion Go S (Z2 Go)

This is my third playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077 first on Stadia, second on Xbox, and now finally on Steam and I honestly didn’t expect the handheld experience to be this good.

Running on Medium settings, the game plays amazingly well on the Legion Go S. Frame rates stay solid around 60 FPS+, even during intense combat, busy city streets, and high-action moments where Night City usually tries to humble your hardware. Instead of compromises, it feels smooth, responsive, and genuinely impressive for a portable system.

What really stands out is how consistent the performance is. Gunfights, driving at speed, dense crowds, and flashy cyberware effects all hold up without stutter or major drops. It never feels like you’re fighting the hardware just the gangs, corporations, and your own bad decisions.

After experiencing Cyberpunk across multiple platforms, this Steam playthrough on the Legion Go S might be the most surprising. It captures the atmosphere, scale, and intensity of Night City without feeling watered down, which is something I never thought I’d say about a handheld version.

Bottom line:
Cyberpunk 2077 runs exceptionally well on the Legion Go S. Medium settings, stable 60+ FPS, and a smooth experience even in intense gameplay. If you’ve been on the fence about playing this on handheld don’t be. Night City feels right at home here.

Highly recommended. 29 out of 30",1767190192,825.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

I’ve spent nearly 20 hours replaying the first and second acts across three separate saves, only to hit the same game-breaking issue every time. The game consistently freezes and flatlines during the Silverhand bomb mission, making further progress impossible regardless of the save used.

At times, the game almost becomes a movie, with interactive cutscenes that last 15 minutes. Again, I personally like this aspect as it allows the creators to progress the narrative in a compelling way..

A few downsides:

I wish there were more explorable interiors, dialog options with random NPCs (outside of quests), and I wish there were not so many plotpoints. 

This is the type of game you have to play 2 or 3 times to fully understand wtf is happening. You are frequently thrusted into the middle of some situation where it's difficult to understand your characters motivation for being involved, or the NPCs motivation for their actions. There are too many random side plot points that are hard to understand

1091500,True,"However, the game still needs more fixes and updates. Bugs, glitches, and performance issues haven’t been fully eliminated, and some updates still break things instead of improving stability. There are also quality-of-life problems that the community has already solved through mods.

This is where the biggest issue comes in: mods. Fan-favorite mods and collections—especially large ones like the Welcome to Night City Nexus/Vortex collection—greatly improve visuals, immersion, UI, and gameplay. Many of these mods fix or enhance things the base game still struggles with. CD Projekt Red should seriously consider officially integrating or supporting popular community mods, or at least providing better tools so updates don’t constantly break them.

Cyberpunk 2077 has amazing potential and has come a long way, but it’s still not “finished.” More polish, long-term fixes, and better mod support would go a long way toward making this the definitive version of the game it was meant to be.",1767133219,298.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The witcher series had a much more enjoyable and interesting story line. I felt that the games atmosphere, gameplay and graphics is where it really shines. The gameplay is very in depth. You can take fighting to many different areas of expertise. You can be crafty and become a net runner, disabling attackers with net attacks. You can take the exact opposite and be more of a brawler and use melee weapons. The enemy combatants also take many different modes of attack towards you as well. So overall I would recommend the game as it shines in many areas and the part where it didn't shine in the story it made up for in it's other positives.

1091500,True,"Really a great video game. Feels like there is an emphasis on fun and enough immersion to loose yourself in without the tedium of GTA V missions.

I'm not usually into games that require leveling up but this felt like good progression and fun goal lines. 

True open world with a lot of side missions to help explore the world and progress at a nice rate.

Normal gets too easy quickly for a regular FPS gamer but hard and normal could really use a setting between them. That being said hard isn't that hard once your leveled up and experienced.

Great game. Rough start but at this point 5/5. Will buy the next one.

Runs well at 1440 on 3900x and 12700 with a 3060- 90-100fps with max graphics and no ray tracing.

I'd initally picked up this game at launch, but dropped it due to the performance issues. I'd been hearing that things are way better recently, so I picked it up again. For starters, the graphics are fantastic, night city really does feel like a real city, and it's clear a lot of effort went into making it so. The combat is fun and engaging, although it does slowly become too easy even at the hardest difficulty (if you engage in all the side content). Towards the end of the game I found myself breezing through main story battles and boss encounters with ease which did make them feel slightly anti climactic. 
Now to the main highlight of the game - the story. Fantastic plot lines all round, great voice acting across the board. The game does a great job at making you feel the weight of decisions you make not only in the main story but also in the side quests which is so rare. I found myself actually deliberating before making choices and feeling hurt or at best left with a bittersweet feeling at the end of most quests.

after having given the game multiple attempts first on a different system and now through steam with some added mods; i am accepting that cyberpunk is not for me.  you know the tutorial in the beginning of the game? how annoying and kind of ridiculous it was? yeah, that.  I am finally choosing to give up on cyberpunk for the same reason i had given up on Atomic Heart.  Both games have some cool characters and stories, and beautiful visuals.  They are undeniably cool games in ways.  I have a friend who loved both of these games.  Not for me though.

the game felt a bit clunky too.  i couldnt get the settings to make the gunfights feel all that good.  i dont remember how many hours i put into it on the console i had it on. as you can see from my hours played on steam though; it didnt take me long to remember why i had quit it two years ago.  i wish the gameplay was smoother and more fun.  just isnt.  you can give a game as great of characters and story as you want, but if the core play isnt fun then ....thumbs down.",1767097713,131.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

I dont know. This game just doesnt klick for me. 

Maybe its the futuristic Asthetic that I normally dont go for, that every person looks like they live in a bodyshop or Tattoo parlor, maybe its the fact that I have played a million open world City game with guns. Maybe its the very in depth character interactions that are just that tad too long that I find skipping them most of the time. Maybe its because I am not that excited about Hacking after Watchdogs destroyed that for me. 

My body is searching for the tiniest and weakest of reasons to quit and do literally anything else. Misread a prompt and got chased by police? quit. Have to walk too far? quit. Dog looks at me funny? quit.

Normally this would go without saying but if you have a short attention span and dont fancy sci-fi or body modifications, this game will just be a bland smudge that you want to get out off.

After accidentally getting the worst ending possible, followed by achieving possibly the best ending the base game offers, I can assure you that if Cyberpunk 2077 came out as polished and good as it is today back then, it would possibly be one of the biggest hits of the year. Sure, the game still has minor bugs, glitches, visual errors but it is nothing compared to what it was in the beginning, they no longer halt the immersion and the experience of the game. I speak for those who won't play the game because of it's bugs and glitches, do not make the same mistake I did. Play it if you have the chance to buy it. Just beware that the story might impact you very deeply, and that is exactly what made it so enjoyable and relatable for me.",1767067835,1889.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5454545617103576

1091500,True,"Several years back, the trailer for this game piqued my interest. However, I purposefully avoided this game after the initial launch due to the poor reception of the release build. Now, years later, after several rounds of patches, additional content and DLC- this game is extremely worth the price. What you get here is great writing, an excellent linear-yet-branching narrative, and characters and worldbuilding that is hard to come by in a lot of modern games. That being said, Cyberpunk 2077 is more of a choose-your-own-adventure type open world FPS game, rather than a traditional RPG- sort of like a cross between a Deus Ex, Fallout, and GTA. 
The game's not perfect, and a lot of the more RPG-esque mechanics feel haphazardly implemented and not relevant to the overall gameplay arc. Crafting, looting, weapon tinkering, XP/HP buffs, and inventory management became something I rarely paid attention to other than making sure I wasn't over my inventory capacity (however, this might appeal to other types of players looking for different gameplay styles). The majority of the side missions and gigs are repetitive and grind-y, but there are a few more interesting ones sprinkled in. And while the setting of Night City is beautifully dystopian, immensely detailed, and huge, the NPCs, some of the locations, and the minute-to-minute interaction with the world make the setting feel more like a diorama rather than a living, breathing, changing city. 
The most recently added DLC, Phantom Liberty, portion of this games adds a really neat espionage aspect to the experience, along with emotionally impactful moments that add real weight and value to the overall story and the decisions you make throughout the campaign.
At the end of the day this is still a really cool, beautiful, craftfully written, hours-of-fun game that I already have about 100 hours in just on my first playthrough - and I'm looking forward to subsequent playthroughs where I can make different story and character choices. That alone make this worth the cost of admission. I'm now more than interested in future games coming from this studio.

1091500,True,"Obviously at this point everyone knows that the launch of this game was one of the worst in gaming history, but since 2022 (when I first played it), all the flaws that took away from what was here are almost nearly eliminated. The 2.0 update and all content that has followed has just expanded upon a game whose story about reputation, capitalism, found family, and survival is fantastic and one of the best stories in the sci-fi genre. The base campaign is great, but Phantom Liberty is even more special. It takes a more streamlined approach to its story and missions, but is darker and more complex in its themes and characters. Speaking of characters, the acting in this game is incredible and almost all characters with a storyline are well fleshed out and thematically unique. One of my favorites was Claire Russell. What seems like a storyline just to introduce a few racing minigames becomes a deep-dive into their motivations for what they do and their backstory, culminating in a conclusion that isn't going to satisfy you or them.

I have never been one to replay a story game over again, one playthrough is enough for me for most games (even ones I love), but not only have I replayed the main campaigns multiple times on separate playthroughs, I am in the middle of completing all achievements this game has to offer and 100% it.

1091500,True,"I'm surprised I like this game as much as I do. I'm not the biggest fan for first person shooters but the world of cyberpunk is breath taking, it feels alive and it pulls you in and keeps you wanting to interact with it more. And it's in these interactions that you begin to explore gameplay mechanics that constantly evolve the more hours you put into the game. Flexible builds with a combination of skill perks, quick hack abilities and cyber-ware upgrades permit vastly different playstyles to match your character and role play. The ability to choose different lifepaths also lets you keep the game fresh for those wanting to play the story again with a decent amount of variation in the dialogue options available for you to choose. 

Negative aspects of this game has to be the AI NPCs, Driving feel and the police system in the game. The police system, while functional almost poses no threat and can be largely ignored which i guess is fine for me as I find the police system more annoying rather than fun to interact with. The suspension in some cars in the game feel too bouncy with the slightest bump quickly throwing you into a tailspin or crashing. also the AI NPCs are sometime too reactive to cars or not reactive at all. many times an innocent NPC has thrown themselves in front my car, causing me to hit them when i was not going to hit them with my car but was only driving close by . This then leads to me having to run from cops which you alreedy know how i feel about that system.

O gameplay é bem livre. Dá pra jogar no stealth, sair hackeando tudo, ou meter o louco no tiroteio. Conforme você vai upando e colocando implantes, o personagem fica cada vez mais forte e divertido de jogar. A sensação de progressão é muito boa.

I cannot ""attach"" myself to nothing there. I cannot talk to many of all of them and all the people i have to talk seem to be all the same. Apart the one that batches up the girls in act 2.

He is a singer, has on the same time (idk why) the best gunplay there is, crits for 1.5k with a pistol, gets his hands on two nukes, sleeps with a chick that than gets beyond the blackwall and has for no reason programmed the programm that all the good stuff is based on, knows places and people after 50 years in stasis, than does not add anything to the story choices, is an asshole and loverboy. Idk, man V himself is not better ""incardinated"" in his doings, story in itself is a clusterfuck. Biochip is no point of anything in the later part of the story, the angle with the Arasaka fizzles out (why was it so important, the chip, that the boy steals it and than has to kill his father?), Its just all over the place.

1091500,True,"This game aged like a fine wine.

If you haven't played it on release, forget about the bad reputation game has recieved then. With constant updates the game has now become ""more or less"" what it was supposed to be on launch.

 Upsides:
+Main story is not great, not terrible. It's just good, could've been way better if the devs had more time/money seems like. It's ending feels really abrupt, and it especially ends really quickly if you skip all the side objectives and quests (otherwise: meet Hanako at embers).
+Night City is great. The cyberdystopian atmosphere and visuals at it's peak. Side tasks are where the game shines the most.
+Gunplay/build system and gameplay in general can be really fun, though it can become repetitive and boring if you go the typical ""stealth archer"" arc with the stealth build+scripts gameplay.
+OST/Music. You should check it out. Combat themes for different gangs, Samurai's songs, Anime Edgerunner's opening song, radio, credits song (yes), especially Johnny's Rebel Path cello version is insane.
+DLC has it's own much more !polished! spy-thriller fiction story, it also unlock a new main game ending if you make certain decisions (secret ending is the best).

 Downsides:
-The game can still feel somewhat janky at it's core and break the immersion due to some little/not so little bugs, lags, dumb AI sometimes etc.
-Driving in this game is shit. Fight me if you think otherwise.
-A slight bitter aftertaste if you think really hard about it - what this game and its ideas (at least it's story) could be if it was given more time and budget. Just an overlapping thought, the game is still good and i will die on this hill, but it could've been so much more better, idk, uegh.

1091500,True,"I did a half-ass normal playthrough when this came out back in 2020, and now that it's on sale I decided to get it since I never played the DLC when it came out. So I decided to do a 100% run this time.

This is a completely different game than the disaster it was at launch. CDPR came through and made it a truly enjoyable experience from start to finish, even if minor glitches and hiccups still keep it from being perfect. The combat is extremely fun, with numerous build paths you can take, the Side Jobs contain some of the best written quests in my opinion (such as the Peralez questline), and the story is one of the greatest in modern gaming, that concludes with a sombre, bittersweet ending for the main campaign (no matter which ending you take). The world itself is incredibly immersive, with stunning visuals and attention to detail. All of that is packed with an amazing soundtrack that kicks up to 11 when the combat gets going.

The DLC adds a new area, with brand new characters and new iconic weapons/cyberware. The story is excellent, containing some of the most gut-punching and tragic moments I've ever experienced. The characters introduced in the DLC are fully realised and memorable, accompanied by excellent dialogue and performances with more tough decisions than ever.

Now, in 2025, a couple years after 2.0 came out, the game is even better. I liked it back then, but now it feels like one of the best games of all time, easily on par with Witcher 3. It needed some time in the oven and now it's near perfect. 

I do recommend getting some mods for the character customization, that is this game's primary con for me, there just isn't enough customization options and some of them weirdly lock you to gendered things. Thankfully, there are mods to fix it, but I would still say the vanilla game is near perfect, and the modding scene is well supported by CDPR so it's pretty easy to install everything, even right in the middle of a playthrough. Speaking of playthroughs, im at 200+ hours on my second playthrough now, not including the first 50, and I think i'll finish the game around 300 hours total with everything done and seen (for the most part).

1091500,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most dynamic games I've ever played. I've played it through fully twice, and each time my experience was different, as was my V. The way I interacted with characters, and the things I chose to do largely hinging on how I felt at the time. And players can do exactly that, choose what they want to do, whether it be to help or to fight the cops, to go in guns blazing or to use stealth, to make friends with characters, or ditch them. The game provides such a sense of freedom while still following a guided set of actions that lead to Cyberpunk's many endings. I'll focus specifically on my first run because it was the one I went into without any prior knowledge of the game. Overall, it was a run filled with options made because of opportunities not taken. Some because they never realized the options were there, and some because they didn't realize it was a better choice until it was too late. All of which is extremely human. It's one of the reasons I like this game. It's human.

1091500,True,"Cyberpunk-the game that made me fall back in love with the action/FPS genre. 

First, the character customization is the best feature and allows you to play a gritty and violent version of the Sims as you navigate Night City. You’re able to choose from dozens of clothing options, unique hairstyles, various eyes, tattoos, scars, private bits, and bold makeup options. 

Next is the leveling and skill tree system-that’s been overhauled since 2024. I am typically a sneaky/ranged player, but there is something so satisfying about becoming a fast-moving, grenade-throwing, blade-wielding technomancer that gives me the feels in all the right ways. I’ve played with a few builds and no matter how you play-it’s a freaking blast. 

The cybernetics go hand in hand with the previous areas, but are worth mentioning on their own. The ability to break down weapons and the world for components, the level multiple areas of your body, and increase your skill builds further-it goes beyond enchanting your armor or crafting mods. 

The music. The music. THE MUSIC. Keanu, angst, metal, and raves? Just listen to the soundtrack-don’t even need to buy the game to fall in love with Samurai.

What is a game without its side quests and time fillers? The quest/job system is similar to Grand Theft Auto and the Journal makes management of your tasks easy. The mini games for hacking, quick time responses, and the ability to kill random gang members to gently boost your street cred are great ways to spend time getting the layout of the city.  

Lastly is the story itself, which allows you to create the canon you want without having a “perfect” ending. Yes-there is an optimal ending, but I’ve had fun playing through each of the outcomes. The dialogue, writing, and acting are phenomenal. I want to hang out with Jackie and Misty, maybe have a beer with Vic or Rogue. Even when you hate them, you are invested in them. 

Special mention: I think most of the glitches are hysterical. My favorite happens when your game cache is getting full or you’re running out of memory; you’ll start to notice lots of duplicate NPCs-specifically “child-size” versions-more specifically floating, “child-size” duplicates. Occasionally the game will crash near the end, but clearing old save files and maintaining your console/PC health should minimize the risk.

If you like Fallout, Skyrim, Mass Effect, The Sims, Baldur’s Gate, The Witcher, Grand Theft Auto, Dragon Age, and neon-don’t wait another 5 years or until another sale to get this game",1766985486,149.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

3rd person GTA mode

better AI npc's incorporated with machine learning chat gpt exc.

better game physics I hope they actually make that happen with Cyberpunk's upcoming game in unreal engine 5

New game+ I don't want to do the delamain stupid side quest every time I start a new save cdpr :/ it's boring and time consuming.

better endings like wtf all the endings are terrible for the main character V just loses he's/her's Identity after the game's finished like the character never existed.

less nude's and 18+ content more real content I know 18+ content is a main part of the game but it's like way too controlled I can't have sex with any one I want and then there's loads of nudes being spammed in my face most of the time like it's just not balanced :/.

better hacking system like watch dogs from ubisoft perhaps ? IDK I think the hacking system is just weird and add's a lot of weird outcomes like you don't get the feeling you outplayed the game and it just makes no difference you can go full blast mode and not touch hacking at all I mean it just doesn't feel good!.

better loot and weapon system like omg the amount of f times I had to stop and not think about looting in this game because of my stupid will to loot everything was so f bad I know there is a crafting system that I never even once used btw like you don't even need to use it! why is it there then!?
but the overweight mechanic is so shit like just remove it if your going to make us loot everything and add weight to cloths and shit man it made me feel disconnected from the world when this happened and so many unnecessary miscellaneous items too that you can't do anything with like it just makes everything so bloated and most of them you never even f use stop making the game feel bloated for gods sake good game though!

the skill tree makes 0 sense like I was confused as hell on my first play through that I could finish the main story without maxing a single tree and I was like why the hell is there even a skill tree then on my second play through I found out you can max a maximum of 3 skill trees which to me is a load of bs comon cdpr I want to be able to max everything when I'm playing a single player game.

3rd thing I want to address there is way too much woke stuff in this game I'm no hater of LGBTQ+ stuff but man do I see so many f shit around that shouldn't be blasted to my face all the time like bro I get it there are 80% straight men and women in this world and 20% non straight and prob trans too so who the f cares real life I go out I see them prob 1 in a year or 2 they are not the majority so lets keep the LGBTQ+ stuff in a controlled and less flashy way if possible if you want to go based on science the world can only be progressing on straight men and women making human beings anything other than evolution is non evolution.

the game is way too f short like we needed more content other than phantom Liberty IDK maybe a whole life with johnnies playthrough would have been nice giving the character more back ground and who he really was and stuff.

look cdpr you made the best game in my opinion but from a gamer perspective I just don't find my self really immersed or get the rush of dopamine when playing the game and some of this stuff really annoys the shit out of me the stealth is also really generic like the combat and all that ; adam smasher was so easy to kill that I was shocked a game of this caliber can be beaten by the likes of black myth wukong like bro come on black myth wukong has the best combat I have ever seen gameplay wise cutscene wise and all that IDK I just hope CDPR can really learn from other games and what made them great then incorporate that into their own game GTA watch dogs black myth wukong hell even red dead or elden ring with those enemies and physics! 

Ok all I want is better gameplay loops and mechanics and less inventory bloating and better physics and characters that actually matter with a good writing and story from the next game hopefully I want cyberpunk's upcoming game to beat the shit out of rockstar for the GTA V online mess they made like wtf is that garbage who f plays that garbage prob kids but it's a 18+ game and I played it when I was 13 and I didn't even touch the online even then because I knew it was hot garbage and I want the next game to win all the awards like I know it's a big ask but I only got so much left to live bro my life's coming to an end slowly and I want to go fulfilled at least.",1766970419,7166.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4545454680919647

1091500,False,"Unfortunately, I am unable, in good faith, to recommend this game.
I have picked this game up two times since it's release. Although I did experience game-breaking bugs during my first playthrough, I dropped this game because it got slow, boring, and stale.
Fast-forward almost half a decade to the second time that I decide to give this game an honest chance, and I still do not find this game enjoyable.

While there is clearly been a lot of work put into this game, it is clearly in the wrong areas. The world feels convoluted and maze-like, but it is not alive. It is exactly that: a maze. The building are walls, or at best platforming steps, the NPCs are copy-paste, an entire city of NPCs that you are unable to interact. For quests almost all missions involve a phone call telling you to go to some place and shoot a dozen of crooks.
The crafting system and level progress are a mess. Weapon customization is minimal and inventory management is terrible. And if you are curious about driving just think that they added a ""autopilot"" mode to spare players the torture.
Now, with all that said, what does the game do well? First off, it has a very nice story - that is, if you are able to keep up with the branching paths and the all technical jargon. The animators and voice actors have truly put their heart and soul into every single main story interaction - emphasis on main story. The cyberware-aspect feels nice but I wish it had a bigger impact that mere stat upgrades (more eye modifications, roller-blade feet, finger-guns, screen-skin...).

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 should not be considered an FPS-shooter. The game is best experienced if you set the difficulty to the lowest setting, focus strictly on the main story, and come to terms that the ""open world"" is only there to disappoint.",1766948054,4906.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.4545454680919647

1091500,True,"I came in expecting GTA and got Watch Dogs instead, best way I would describe this game is a gem covered in piss.

First of all, Night City looks amazing, CDPR really outdid themselves here with all these small details that makes the world feel lived in. They have details in every nook and cranny of NC, there are tons of environmental storytelling spread throughout, and the gangs and cops interact with each other, shooting on the side of roads or whilst in the middle of a car chase. No other game has a city this good.

The story itself falls flat whenever it tries to make me care about anyone dying, they never gave you any time with those characters to make you care about them barring Jackie. It's one appearance and they're dead. Adding to making me not care about anything, is the fact that choices don't matter most of the time, and even if it does, it's most likely just a single throwaway line in the next mission or something. The only choice that really affect the ending of the game is the one before the final mission, just like in GTA V. But despite its issues, i did enjoy it somewhat, not the best but not the worst either.

Gameplay is pretty much like Watch Dogs, guns and blades feels amazing and looks cool but the driving physics is horrendous, and you can avoid cops by simply being in the water. My issue with gameplay is that it's wide but shallow, mechanics like hiding bodies, swimming, food buffs, etc. are only used once or never, missions never take advantage of them, I don't even know why they're included, JUST LET ME DIE WHEN I TOUCH THE WATER LIKE GTA:VC GODDAMIT!

1091500,True,"I can't give this a thumbs down because of how good everything else is, but I take issue with the RPG elements. There are plenty of half baked synergies presented to the player but in truth there are only a handful of viable builds. So many are distractions that should be ignored. Stacking a 2.5% bonus, or in some cases 0.05% bonus 5 times does not present an opportunity to base your build on that. Same goes for ""cool"" sounding combat loops that are impractical for 90% of scenarios.  For instance if there are mitigation perks & bonuses then I expect to construct a full build around mitigation and if I stack everything correctly it should be as powerful as having full armour + max health. 

The synergies are too weak, and most wearable items DO NOT PLAY INTO IT AT ALL!!. Missed opportunity to say the least. Ridiculous. Learn from games like Underrail where they got everything right.

By end game you can end up having 15+ in all attributes which cheapens your RPG efforts.

1091500,True,"I got Cyberpunk 2077 with Phantom Liberty from a Spring/Summer Steam Sale in 2025, around the time a new patch came in.

After the introductory Act I I could give in to my usual ""jump into anything but the Main Quest"" approach and I was rewarded with a metric mountain of fun and weirdness. When the side-, sub- and ad hoc quests were done, one step further along the main path opened up another load of side stuff. Heartily approved.

The story, both the main one and the DLC were interesting, and even sad at times. So many apparently small choices affected things later on, which was always nice. Or annoying if I had chosen a bit hastily.

I found a fun way to live in this world, and I imagine a bunch of different approaches would also be made worth it, which adds to replayability. Alsø: you can go around hitting the incredibly trigger-happy cops in the face with a motorized dildo. It's a shame Myers' fate wasn't in my hands but I guess that'd been too much of power-tripping 🤔

During my playthrough I had maybe two dozen crashes, most often when changing from a heavy area to another. Dogtown's pyramid region triggered a good amount of them. In addition to that, at least the core of Corpo Plaza and some corners in Kabuki sub-district caused some slowdowns.

My only actual complaint is the camera handling while driving in the 3rd person view, it never felt natural to me. A smaller one are the various ""you can't save here/now"" moments, which have never made any sense to me.

1091500,False,"Cyberpunk 2077 – A Shiny but Mediocre Experience

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that looks impressive on the surface but ultimately feels like an overhyped and underwhelming experience. Even after the 2.3 update, it remains more style than substance.

The Good

The strongest part of Cyberpunk 2077 is its graphics. On a PC with an RTX 5060 Ti, the game can look stunning. With standard RTX enabled, the visuals are sharp, atmospheric, and detailed. Night City is visually impressive and clearly had a lot of effort put into its presentation.

The gameplay, especially shooting, is decent for what it is. Gunplay feels responsive enough, and moment-to-moment combat can be enjoyable at times.

The Bad

Path tracing is a major disappointment. Turning it on completely ruins performance. Even with DLSS enabled, the game drops below 30 FPS, feels sluggish, and suffers from noticeable latency. Frames may technically be there, but the motion is not smooth, making it unplayable. In short: path tracing is not worth using.

Weapon variety is another weak point. Despite the number of weapons available, most of them feel almost identical. Only a few legendary weapons stand out, while the rest lack personality or meaningful differences.

The story is one of the biggest letdowns. Player choices barely matter. The three different class options at the beginning of the game have almost no impact on the overall experience. The endings are predictable, and you can see where things are going long before you get there. The illusion of choice is there, but real consequences are not.

Technical Issues

Game-breaking bugs are still present. During my playthrough, I experienced at least one crash per session. In multiple cases, I was forced to reload much older saves due to bugs that blocked progress. This severely hurt the overall experience and made the game frustrating to play.

Final Thoughts

Cyberpunk 2077 is a visually impressive but shallow game. It is a shiny cyberpunk mess that never fully delivers on its promises. Even after years of updates, it feels barely functional beneath the surface. The hype surrounding this game far outweighs what it actually offers.

I've played all the stages of it, the buggy start, the mid development and finally the last update with everything flashed out.

I cried, I laughed, I had to think about decisions... never a satisfying outcome, but always strougle. Not strougle with the game mechanics, V is pretty much OP no matter what you choose, but with the choices you have to make along the way.

As someone who strougled with depression one of the endings hit me like a truck... 

I love this game and I wish it was even longer and with more dificult choices. The constant battle with the decisions you have to make along the way is something I grew found off. They are never just good or evil, it's all a matter of prespective, and even though the decisions themselves don't give you that dopamine hit in the moment, you get the satisfaction of the overall story.

I'll wait some time, and maybe with mods or maybe evem without mods, I'll definitely come back to it.
My next play through will definitelly be much calmer and with more attention to detail now that I played most of the endings.

It's definitely worth experiencing. Personally, I think there are aspects that could help the game improve in future versions, such as further upgrading the gameplay, giving the story more freedom (of course, this will be difficult to develop because there are many situations that need to be handled), breathing life into the NPCs and the city to make them more vibrant and realistic, and better optimizing the game so that medium-sized machines can still play it.

1091500,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty enjoyable alternative history ride. I can see why Keanu Reeves was a pretty perfect choice to introduce us to the world because it did feel like they pandered to 90's kids quite a bit.

While there are some really strong moments in the game, they are often contrasted with other things that notably don't live up to the expectations that the other content sets.

There are often these great set piece moments with NPC's where they are animated quite fluidly for the scenario and then the instant the talking is over they return to a sort of unnatural walk pattern of the 'standard' animations.

Ray tracing is excellent, especially in the rain - The well crafted urban areas are super impressive but then you notice that one reflection is consistently missing - The character you spent all this time customising is entirely absent from reflections. Basically the only thing not reflected is the one thing you'd most expect to see.

You can walk around giant areas of this well worn city with absolutely tons of NPC's looking really natural, living a life but then when you get into combat almost every NPC behaves exactly the same and the fighting is very samey as a result.

You can set your car to auto-drive to your destination but you'll quickly find this feature is more likely to be 'auto crash into something'. A great feature for immediately making a horde of police come kill you, I guess night city isn't a fan of arrests so the 5 star notoriety system doesn't land as well as it does in GTA.

Only had a single game crash in over 60 hours and after the first loading screen there is no loading unless you use fast travel. I was able to play with all the graphics set high, which was very welcome given the game had a reputation on launch for performance issues.


Overall, for all the pain points I had, they were vastly outweighed by how impressive Night City is and for all the times I wished there was a narrative option available that they didn't cover, I was usually still able to enjoy the ones they did have. I'm now very eager to see Cyberpunk '2', while previously I was unfussed about the genre of Cyberpunk, which is why I waited so long to play 2077.",1766916633,4055.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

the universe night city is set in (created by Mike Pondsmith, love that guy) is incredible, and mimics reality in a lot of ways, most are political so I wont go into detail :D  the lore is deep and detailed. I could double how much playtime I have and still be learning new things.

the music is fantastic. from the variety in radio stations to the ambience and cinematic stuff :D
the gameplay (movement and gunplay specifically) is beautiful. driving is a little eh but that's okay.
the skill trees are huge, there are so many different builds you can have. 
character creation is amazing too.

phantom liberty is one of the best dlcs I've ever played, it feels like a whole other game sometimes. on top of the story itself, PL adds so much extra content :D

another great aspects is modding. this game has one of the most active modding scenes I've seen in any game.

1091500,False,"You know what I tried to like this game and give it a chance and get into it after sleeping on it for 5 years and you know what. There is a reason I slept on it. This game just sucks. It's not fun, its also depressing. I'm finding myself forced into a nonstop series of dialogue and cinematics that are seemingly never ending. I keep waiting for the game to finally open up and let me explore and enjoy the open world I was told existed in the game but it seemingly never happens. I got stuck and early on lost interest after a very boring part of the game emerged where I needed to use a series of different filters and scan various parts and rewatch an overall cringe cinematic over and over which was completely boring. I eventually fired the game back up and forced myself to get past the stuck part I was bored to tears playing. Then I'm greeted with more cinematics and more linear boringness. I am currently stuck at a part where finally some action is starting to happen but it appears I am forced to only use stealth and my bare hands despite everyone having weapons and being able to pick them up but not able to equip them I guess cause the game is forcing you to use stealth only in this part. This game just sucks ass and it is boring as shit along with being cringe and depressing. It is also a copy of a much better game and game series and favorite of mine which is Deus Ex. This game copied everything from Deus Ex but just did it much more terribly and made it very boring and linear and cringe when the only new thing I suppose it is trying to offer and build upon the greatness that was Deus Ex but failing miserably is that it is supposedly offering at one point a large open world type of gameplay similar to the GTA series but I wouldn't know cause I got bored from being many hours in and stuck in what appears to be a never ending linear path of cringe and boringness and constant cinematics. If I wanted to sit and watch hours of cinematics I would watch a movie not attempt to play a game. This embodies everything that is wrong with modern games essentially. For example fire up Mario Brothers 3 on the NES. You are just instantly greeted with an awesome game that is fun right from the start, playing the actual game is the fun part. It does not force you to watch hours and hours of cinematics about Bowser and Mario and his goal to rescue peach and what happened to peach and why she was captured by Bowser to begin with. Throughout the game there might be a small paragraph explaining the story that lasts a total of 5 seconds to give you some quick insight of what is going on. You are not forced to sit there for hours bored to tears and unable to play the game due to being forced to watch a never ending cutscene that is at times interactive in terms of decisions but still ultimately boring. Oh yeah they didn't fix the bugs still. I'm looking at a tall red light in the game and move the camera and it breaks into a bunch of black blocks all over it which looked terrible All this game had going for it was all the hype and it failed to live up to it. I should never feel like I am having to force myself to enjoy a game or try to enjoy it. It should never be a painfully boring experience to try to enjoy or get to the fun part that never seems to arrive and instead just more boring linear gameplay and endless cinematics.

Just existing in Night City, taking in the visuals, characters, and stories, is a huge part of the appeal.
The game does a great job letting you live out the cyberpunk fantasy. Whether you’re following the main story, doing side jobs, or just wandering the city, it nails the feeling of being in a futuristic dystopia. The world-building is the real star here, and it kept me hooked the entire time.

1091500,True,"From Broken Promise to Modern Masterpiece

It is no secret that Cyberpunk 2077 had a rocky launch, releasing in an unfinished state. However, CD Projekt Red refused to give up, polishing this rough diamond into a true gem that finally lives up to the high expectations set after The Witcher 3. Today, Night City is a breathtaking, dystopian playground that sucks you in with its incredible atmosphere and a soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood.

The gameplay variety is where the game truly flexes its muscles. The character creator is top-tier, allowing you to shape V exactly how you want. You can play as a silent Netrunner, hacking cameras and frying enemies' brains from the shadows, build a tough melee colossus who charges through the front door, or become a high-mobility stealth ninja, slicing through foes with a katana before they even know you're there. Switching playstyles completely changes the experience.

The narrative is deep, emotional, and filled with side quests that feel just as important as the gripping main story. Combined with complex side gigs and the phenomenal Phantom Liberty expansion, this game is now a complete, unforgettable experience.

The story is what really hooked me. The characters felt real, the choices actually carried weight, and there were multiple moments that made me stop and think instead of just rushing to the next objective. Side quests didn’t feel like filler either,  a lot of them were just as engaging as the main storyline and helped build the world even more.

Visually, the game is stunning. Night City is one of the most impressive open worlds I’ve explored, especially at night. The atmosphere, music, and overall vibe all come together perfectly and really pull you in.

Performance-wise, my experience was solid, and any minor issues never took away from how much I enjoyed the game. Once I got rolling, I was fully locked in.

There are hidden things everywhere.  Currently I have 900 hours played and I am still finding things I've never seen.
Id recommend this to any gamer (and even non gamers) 100%.
That said the game does have some bugs and limitations,  Though nothing major that cant be addressed with mods or just ignored.
Photo mode is amazing, but I would like to see more freedom in it. Like a free pose mode and the ability to use it anywhere at anytime no matter the action.

1091500,True,"[h1] SHOULD YOU PLAY CYBERPUNK IN 2026? [/h1]


[i] First, I want to address a common misconception: [/i]

This game, when it initially launched in late 2020, was in an abysmal state, to say the least. That's a fact. There were bugs, glitches, and issues plaguing the game that turned away everyone who was even remotely interested in picking it up, but these issues were so traumatic, that it ended up turning away people who didn't even want to play it in the first place. (Think: ""Cyberpunk? Isn't that the game with all the bugs""?) ~ This still happens even to this day. 


[b] HOWEVER [/b]

They have fixed most, if not all of the major bugs, and is now far beyond ""playable"". In fact, I'm going to go as far as to say that it's close to perfect in terms of performance. Despite it's rough beginning, it bounced back BETTER THAN ANY GAME I'VE EVER SEEN. This game went from ""Don't bother playing"" to ""it's one of the greatest games ever made"" in a few years. The release of the anime ""Cyberpunk: Edgerunners"" in 2022 sparked it's resurgence, as well. (a true must-watch) CD Project Red (developers of ""The Witcher"" Franchise) didn't disappoint. In any case, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this review.


[h2] CYBERPUNK 2077 IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER MADE [/h2]

And I don't say this lightly. I've been playing video games of all genres for the vast majority of my life across every single platform know to man. From the Nintendo DS, PlayStation, Xbox, switch, PC, even the Wii: U. This game, in time, will become a [i] timeless classic [/i].

If I had to list my personal top 3 games of all time, it would be Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, and Minecraft. This is just my subjective opinion, take it as you will. 

[u] TL;DR: Yes, you should pick up this game INCLUDING it's DLC - ""Phantom Liberty"". It adds a whole new area to the map, new weapons, NPC's, sidequests, and an entire additional ""main"" story with 4 endings and countless combinations of plot-points alterations. I would go as far as to say it's worth picking up even if it is not on sale. [/u]


[h2] WHAT MAKES IT SO GREAT? [/h2]

Okay, why should you pick up this game, and what makes it a top 3 game of all time, you ask? Here's my take:
Cyberpunk 2077 tells one of the most compelling stories that I've ever experienced. I'm talking Attack on titan, game of thrones, etc level of compelling. There are only 2 games I've played that have ever made me cry: Minecraft (mostly nostalgia) and Cyberpunk: 2077, specifically the DLC ending ""The Tower"". This game genuinely broke me. Watching the accompanying anime ""Cyberpunk Edgerunners"" Only added to the seasonal depression this game sent me into.

If you're looking for a story-rich open world RPG with deep character customization (3 ""life paths"" aka backstories available), potentially dozens of possible endings with 12 ""main endings"" (depending on the choices you make), smooth gunplay, melee optionality (I'm looking at you, apogee sandevistan + katana), and truly unforgettable characters such as Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reaves) and Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba) - this game is a [b] MUST PLAY. [/b] 

I recommend this game to people the way I recommend Skyrim to people. As in: ""Wait... you HAVEN'T played it yet??""

I could go on and on about the beautiful graphics, mechanics, story, etc - but let me talk about some of the more ""underappreciated"" features of this game:

[olist]
[*] [b] The story is very unisex: [/b] Picking a Male or Female MC makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE but still feels consistent and smooth. Both are FULLY voice-acted and either path actually makes a huge difference on many side quests and dialogue options. To the point to where I say the game is worth doing a playthrough once as Female V and once as Male V to get the ""full experience"". 
[*] [b] No loading screens.. ever: [/b] The entire map is SEAMLESS.
[*] [b] Highly immersive world: [/b] My vocabulary is forever ruined because of this game. The lingo this game has constructed is so addictive, it bleeds into my day to day life. IYKYK.
[*] [b] The Drip: [/b] The clothing customization is TOP TIER. You can make your character look like a tactical gunmen, ninja, rockstar, prostitute, and everything in between. I have PAGES of clothing options (men can wear women's clothes and vice versa) [added realism]
[*] [b] Advanced NPC dialogue: [/b] The amount of time I've spent exploring Night City, and I overhear a random NPC conversation with the craziest tea/lore I've heard since GTA: V radio interviews is absurd. Sometimes, you can even chime in during certain conversations. The city feels ALIVE.
[*] [b] Lightweight: [/b] The game, including the DLC, is a mere 85GB of space. And yet, it still looks better than any other Unreal Engine 5 game I've played. 
[*] [b] Soundtrack: [/b] The music is INSANE - I have half the radio songs on my irl playlist because they're THAT good. (I'm looking at you, ""I really want to stay at your house"" - sends me to tears every time.)
[*] [b] Repeatable love interest side quests: [/b] In this game, you can start a quest called ""I really want to stay at your house"" where your love interest of choice can come over to one of your night city apartments, and you just... hang out. Dance, watch TV, cuddle, shower, drink, sleep, etc - a very interesting infinitely repeatable sidequest that adds serious realism. Your love interest's dialogue options even change depending on what's going on in the main story, a very cool detail most players miss. 
[*] [b] Controller/K&M friendly: [/b] Controller support is exceptional, and mouse and keyboard doesn't feel ""bogged down"" with random keybinds for every single little thing, unlike most games of it's type. 
[/olist]


[h2] STILL NOT CONVINCED? [/h2]

If you're still on the fence about whether or not you should play this game, then I highly recommend you watch the anime ""Cyberpunk: Edgerunners"" **on Netflix only :(**. This will give you a good idea of what Night City is all about. 

Personally, I'm going to start another playthrough soon to get a difference experience. Although I've only done one as Male V so far, I'm going to do another run as Female V. However, I think it's worth mentioning that I reloaded several saves to experience all of the endings, so I've already seen all there is to see in terms of the main story. Expect my playtime to increase as time goes on - my opinion isn't going to change. 

[h2] IN SUMMARY [/h2] 

Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the greatest games ever created. Period. I personally rate it above Skyrim but below Elden Ring (albeit, barely) - and I'm a sucker for fantasy RPG's, [i] that's how good this game is. [/i] I don't care if you're ""not into single-player games"" - this DOES NOT EVEN FEEL LIKE ONE Because Johnny Silverhand is talking to you half the time. The world is so immersive I didn't even notice that I was playing by myself half the time, because it genuinely didn't feel like it. The characters are so memorable and lovable, it actually broke my heart to get certain endings because of the bad outcome. Please, I beg of you, if you can only pick up one gift this Christmas season, let it be Cyberpunk 2077. It will not disappoint. 

[spoiler] P.S. If you're going to pick this game up, I HIGHLY recommend making a manual save during the mission ""Firestarter"" in the Phantom Liberty DLC so you can reload your save and go back to experience other endings without having to replay half the game. You'll thank me later. Oh, and also - don't forget you can actually save Takemura during the mission ""Search and Destroy"" by jumping back up the hole you fall through, or by finding your way back upstairs. (The reasons I mention this is because there's an achievement for doing so, and you might get locked out of this and will be forced to start another playthrough otherwise, if you're achievement-hunting) [i] oh noooo, I guess I have to play the entire game again... whatever shall I doooo ;)[/i] [/spoiler]",1766803588,5260.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,True,"This is a game I came close to buying when it was first released, mainly because I almost bought into the hype machine, but I didn't and felt vindicated given the shit show that followed. Having put it out of mind for a few years I finally decided to give it a go based on the fact that I've been hearing more and more positive recommendations, particularly after they released Phantom Liberty. And I can say it is now a very good game.

The games start is kind of slow and I liked the it less at the beginning. The introduction has you restricted to certain parts of Night City for a few hours but gets better once you're let loose on the whole map. Initially I was broadly following the main story questline, which to be honest is kind of weak and I was surprised when I reached the point of no return a lot sooner then expected. However as you encounter characters in the main plot line, some more side quest lines open up and I started to play through these alongside some of the other side quests you can find dotted around the map.

These are a lot more enjoyable and this warmed me up to the game a lot more. Add Phantom Liberty which has both a fantastic main and side questlines and it gets even better. I actually enjoyed the Phantom Liberty storyline a lot more than the one from the main game. Even Keanu Reeves character who I disliked when I was mostly playing the main plotline, ended up being much more likeable in the side quests and DLC. 

My favourite part of this game is Night City itself. It looks like a grim, bleak shithole and yet has a sort of beauty to it all the same. Theres a surprising amount of interior locations as well which often have a side gig mission tied in, so its not all just endless blocks of unenterable buildings. It is a fun place to explore and does feel like a living breathing city. Even though there are plenty of fast travel points, I did find myself opting to drive most of the time just to take in the city. Also speaking of the driving I was really impressed with this as well. The cars just feel really satisfying to drive and control differently depending on the type of car. I also loved the car aesthetic in this game with a sort of futuristic 80's look to a lot of the cars. Even the shitbox cars have their own unique charm.

Combat in this game is ok. Less so in the beginning when you have few upgrades or abilities and the enemies are like bullet sponges. But as you level up and get better equipment you can end up really powerful and its more enjoyable being a badass mowing down enemies. Theres also the option to use stealth and hacking which is also a lot of fun, and I found that was the better approach in the early game. The stealth here reminded me a little bit of Deus Ex which was why I favoured the stealth approach more in the early game and the bullet sponge enemies is less of a factor with stealth.

One disappointment was I felt that the roleplaying element was a bit restricted. You can pick an origin at the beginning of the game which can impact dialogue options and your skills do to, but I felt as lines were voice acted, the dialogue options were generally pretty restricted. That said I played the male V and really liked the voice actor and in general the voice acting is pretty impressive throughout the game. It also has a great soundtrack although I think because the music in this game is so varied there will inevitably be a few tracks you will just hate.

Overall I really enjoyed this game. Maybe still not quite at the level it had been hyped up to before it was released but they've closed that gap a lot. So if you were put off by the games state on release its worth trying now. Also I think Phantom Liberty is a must buy. It elevates the game a lot in my opinion.",1766800661,4432.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I can't say how rich or interesting the story is, because you simply never understand when or why things happen. Your actions do have consequences, which is good, but their logic is completely unclear. In that case, even the most brilliant plot goes down the drain.

The interface is a whole other story: it's such an ancient mess that it feels like the Japanese developer who made it must be 200 years old. You should be glad they managed to come up with anything at all.

As for the music, it's absolutely forgettable. Even now, while playing, I can't recall a single track. The rest of the sound design is decent, though.

The open world is another disappointment. It's not just uninteresting—it’s so oddly designed that you stop caring about it entirely.

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This game was my first souls-like. The cinematics and cutscenes are upper echelon, the scenery is peak, and you can tell the entirety of everything was well thought out. From emerging through a tunnel and seeing the sacred Erdtree in perfect view, to killing a boss after an unholy amount of attempts, to finding the most niche easter egg, Elden Ring can easily have you busy for THOUSANDS of hours.

This is a game I recommend playing at your own pace, in your own style, because the first playthrough will be your most memorable by a landslide.

That being said, I know the whole point of this vague, open world game is to allow you to have your own adventure, but I think a quest log of some sort wouldn't hurt just to provide a bit of organization and prevent players from skipping out on content.

All in all, a very memorable gaming experience that I could see a wide variety of gamers enjoying whether they be more casual or hardcore.",1767596935,24576.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

1245620,False,"I'm the odd man out.

I fully acknowledge Elden Ring's popularity and wide appeal, unfortunately I have no desire to continue putting any more time into it, nor have I enjoyed the vast majority of my time playing. My lack of enjoyment comes from two sources, the setting and the gameplay.

Simple explanation first, my issues with the setting. I find it purposefully niche. Maybe if I was more interested in the overall aesthetic, I would be able to push through my disinterest in the plot or characters, unfortunately almost every boss, enemy, and NPC is ugly as sin. Yes, it is supposed to feel depressing and like you're up against larger-than-life enemies, but instead of feeling inspired to pick up my sword and fight until my last breath, I am completely uninterested, checked out, and bored. Nothing about Elden Ring's setting, characters, or enemies inspire or immerse me, and I will fully accept that this is not a fault of the game itself and simply a misalignment of my interests and the games inspiration. 

Next in my major concerns is gameplay. I find the combat in Elden Ring feels slow, sloppy, and difficult to navigate. I've fought enemies at high level, low level, for hours before beating them and beaten some before reading their name. While the time spent mastering my dodges is satisfying in some respects, I barely felt any level of enjoyment in beating enemies. What I did often feel was the relief of never having to fight them again, and the dread of having to fight something else.

Between my disinterest in the setting and the gameplay I struggled to have any enjoyment, regardless of the method or approach. I envy those who find this gameplay engaging. From the stories I've heard it FromSoftware games have been lifechanging for some and I don't doubt their effect on most, but for me this was time I wish I could get back.",1767574316,2126.0,True,False,False,1,1,0.4831081330776214

Finishing Elden Ring at 100% is both grueling and glorious. It takes 150–200+ hours, at least three playthroughs, and careful tracking of missable items. The reward is a deep appreciation of FromSoftware’s design—every ending, every legendary weapon, every hidden questline.

Pros: Immense world, varied builds, unforgettable lore, true sense of mastery.

Cons: Time-heavy, opaque quests, some frustrating missables.

And something I feel the Dark Souls series lacked, a 10/10 story that you get given to you in an understandable narrative BUT you can, additionally, seek more lore through item descriptions and environmental storytelling, which is wonderful.

The only complaint I have about this game is its lack of accessibility settings that are, on purpose, not included. Not even a pause button (though the game can be paused by a secret technique players found). 

I deeply and wholly recommend this game to anyone who has doubts about the Souls series.

1245620,True,"I have a lot of mixed options of the game as a whole, but most of them stem from not enjoying massive open world games and a lot of the design decisions they tend to come with them - filler content such as many recycled bosses, very similar dungeons (with few exceptions that go kinda hard) and a lot of loot that simply didn't appeal to me due to preference in how I play (spirit ashes etc.).

Despite all of that though, I feel like this game has some of the best ""main dungeons"", the best build variety in the series and a handful of bosses that I think are among the best in FromSoft's library. On top of that, due to to the open nature of the game you have quite a bit of freedom in getting your build going very early despite some items being located further in, which is really nice on repeat playthroughs - even though the process of just riding in a mostly straight line feels a bit dull and boring to me, and the only thing I can really do to deviate from that is doing side content I don't really care for.

There's definiely a lot of good in this game that caused me to put many hours into it beyond just beating it once, but a lot of it was unfortunately me having to put up with the aspects I didn't enjoy as much more-so than consistent enjoyment every second.

Ultimately, I still think the game is deserving of its overwhelmingly, well deserved positive reputation. It succeeds at what it's trying to be - I just don't enjoy exactly everything it's trying to be in the first place.",1767487893,67047.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

1245620,True,"For anyone who likes carving out a path in the wild or tackling formidable challenges, Elden Ring is undoubtedly worth playing. The open world is massive and bristling with life in a way that makes respect for nature hard to avoid. And there's always something fun waiting around the corner: a new area to explore, an alien boss that kicks your ass

The fighting is real severe at the beginning, but when you figure it out, everything is very satisfying. Every victory feels liike it was earned through sweat and blood, which can be rewarding in its own way. The bosses are memorable, the atmosphere is amazing and it is nice to realize that a game doesn't punish you just for asking questions

But it's definitely not for everyone. If you don't appreciate ultra hard games the way some people don't mind cutting off their noses to spite their faces (I have fun with these folks) then Elden Ring is a hard sell.

1245620,False,"Elden Ring is a great game. Just a few minutes ago, I completed my third playthrough and obtained every achievement. I will most definitely play it again, as I am a big fan of the Soulsborne series. However, this game receives a bad rating for the following reasons:

1) Despite my system exceeding the game’s system requirements, the game ran poorly. I experienced stutters from the very beginning, which eventually escalated into heavy, permanent freezes and crashes. I had to restart my system multiple times due to how badly the game performed. After contacting the publishers for help, they eventually stopped responding after all their guesswork failed to resolve the problem. In order to run the game properly, I had to install a mod, which is something I am strongly against. Although the mod fixed my problems, it forced me to play the game offline. I never got to experience the online mode.

2) Despite how good the game is, it is very overrated. After a few hours of playing, I noticed that many locations are clearly copy-pasted, and the majority of bosses are also reused. Repetition is extremely frequent, which easily pushed this game to the bottom of my Soulsborne ranking.

3) The DLC’s story completely ruined the experience for me. Whoever was responsible for designing the DLC’s characters and narrative clearly wanted to see the franchise burn. As a result, I personally chose to ignore the DLC entirely.

Regardless of how good a game may be, it receives a negative review by default if it does not run properly. Since the publishers failed to help me resolve the issue, my trust is gone. I have removed Elden Ring Nightreign from my cart and will not purchase anything developed by FromSoftware again.

My first introduction to Souls games and I wasn't too excited to try it, because despite being very visually appealing it didn't seem to fit my game tastes much.
Now I come to regret I didn't pick it up earlier, it is a very beautiful and fun environment. The lore is very interesting even if I barely know much yet, the atmosphere sure is immersivable with each region and there's tons to explore. 

The first hours sure hurt though, I suppose that's what never got me into Souls games, but after you get into the rythm of this type of gameplay it sure is fun to play this dance with the enemies, knowing when to dodge each one and punish them.

I probably would have double or more the hours as of writting and have not finished the game if my friends who previously played didn't guide me a bit, because it sure doesn't tell you much on how to exactly do something or where to go in detail, just pointers. That I guess is what can make you play for hundreds of hours since the exploration of this game is plentiful, which isn't inherantly bad, but might leave you to wander lost if you are trying to do or get something in specific with no references.

- The stated attribute scaling stats on weapons have a fairly strong tendency to lie about what stats to level into. This is so balls to the walls insane that im genuinely taken aback that this got left in the game for this long.

- enemies tend to hit hard at base, and if you stray from the intended beginer's path little bit (in the game that sells on having a lot of exploration in it), everything starts to hit really, really hard

- money required to level up scales really hard compared to most games of this type that ive played, requiring 4k runes to go from lvl 24 to lvl 25

- sprinting is not a thing. 

- if you inspect a non-pickupable item you find in the world (a portal for example), it sometimes puts you in some sort of ""notifying state"" where theres a lil popup telling you something. during this you also cant attack, dodge, parry, use items, use objects, or even pause game. and if its in an area with a big group of enemies, it tends to last a lot longer for some reason (6-10 seconds jumping up to 20-25 seconds).

- the money you drop on death in a boss room remains in that boss room, meaning you have to either balance fighting the boss and getting your money again without dying (which will lose you all of the money), or blow everything on merchant items before the boss. but if you fall to your death during the fight, it spawns right outside the darn boss room. this issue is avoided completely in other souls likes, such as lies of p, which i had a lot more fun with. 

- lore is not communicated too well


Cool things that i like
- Horse

- double jumping horse

- fantastic graphics & Fucking beautiful art direction. no, those are not the same thing. they are mutually exclusive things. one is stuff like polycount on models and ray-traced lighting. the other is the result of using those graphical tools to make art, and that usually takes a lot of time and dedication. you can be great on both, or terrible on both, or good on one and not the other. And if you needed me to tell you that, then im glad i did :)

- Fast travel in a souls like that doesn't require being at a Site of Grace/bonfire equivalent.

- Player messages & bloodstain mechanic

overall i feel like this wasnt worth the $40 i spent on the winter sale for this. if 5/10 is an accurate rating for the average steam game, this game is a 4/10. it has loads of potential that it dangles in front of you constantly, and then stabs you for looking up.

1245620,False,"Spoiler warning

Ok the first thing i will say is that its a great game for people who want to get into souls games and have never played any hard game, with that being said i will say the difficulty of the game was unbelievably easy with me only dying at most 5-7 times to any of the main story bosses(optional ones too). I died far more in games like terrarias ""calamity infernum"" mod than in elden ring and with all the hype about certain bosses being very difficult i was pretty disappointed. 

The map looks amazing truly, but it gets pretty old with most of the loot being either competely useless to you or you just have so much of it that you dont need more. Once you get an early game armor set it will carry you to mid-late game then you will get one more armor set that you will finish the game with and will never use the other armor sets that you were given, this applies with weapons at least in my experience.

Many of the characters that i have grown attached to like Hewg got little to no dialog, i would have loved to see more of his relationship with Roderika and even a quest line but nothing happens. They had a father daughter relationship but we never got to see any of it and that really disappointed me.

The enemy targeting system in this game is absolutely horrible with the game targeting an enemy behind the one literally killing me so often, and when you are fighting some of the side bosses like the two crucible bosses it really gets in the way. Because the game doesnt allow you to lock your screen to where the character is facing (or atleast i couldnt find any) you cant target the enemies well yourself. The game doesnt do a great job at explaining much of the mechanics with me needing to search up how to do certain things and how the level system worked.

Lake Lucaria was very empty with the two of the three castle being questline areas and the last one having far far less than Stormveil Castle. The rest of the area was pretty much empty with me riding around on my horse most of the time. The first areas that you can reach had so much more to explore and to find to a point that you say to yourself ""if this is how the rest of the game is it will take me ages to finish the game"" but then you get through most of the mid to late game in half the time.

I might have missed couple things but yea,

I havent finished the game yet so if my opinions change i will edit my review but as of playing this game and being very close to finishing it i would have gave game of the year to God of War Rag and personally i dont think its close. I heard a lot of praise for this game calling it the greatest game of all time and was disappointed. One more thing THE FACT THAT MALENIA AND RADAHN ARE OPTIONAL BOSSES IS ABSOLUTLY CRAZY. Overall 7/10 maybe 6/10 game. would love to hear what people think about my opinion.

1245620,True,"Game is good. 

Co op should be easier to get into. You should not have need to use an item to see summon signs. 
And bosses should not be buffed that much when you do co op. Max they should be buffed is like 25% for two players and 25% more if there are three. So max 150% , the thing is if players wanted challenge they would just not use summons so why make it more challenging when there are summoned players.

Bosses should have more openings. If i dodge a hit i should get atleast as much as hits as i dodged the combos of bosses. So if i dodge a combo of 5 hits , i should get some hits in , boss should have more recovery time on their attacks. It feels like players is not participating as much. Or give a talisman that makes it so if you dodge an attack it damages the boss. Like in sekiro you were progressing the fighting with deflecting. 

And bosses like Margit jump back like 5 times in row when you trying to be aggressive. Enemies jump back as soon as you are about to get a hit. No bosses should be jumping back at all.

Weapons without bleed should be buffed. R2 attacks should be buffed as well , atleast the poise damage they do. Not talking about holding R2 but just normal R2.

You should not have to go to mines to get smithing stones in every new playthrough. There should be more player freedom on how they approach weapon upgrades. Enemies should Drop more upgrade materials so you can farm the upgrades reliabely.

Drop rates should be increased for all items tbh.

Game could have been smaller but dense and like open world could have been more shorcuts and stuff. like intereconnected like Dark Souls 1. And unlock shortcuts. 

Speaking of Shortcuts , level design needs to better in terms of shortcuts. Shorcuts should make you question your sense of direction like Dark Souls 1.

Some weapon are too good , like bleed weapons. Needs Balancing. Makes we just wanna use those weapons like katana in every playthrough.

And there should be more questlines regarding spirit summons. Like jellyfish quest. It was cute and hearwarming.

Combat is deep, precise, and punishing. Every enemy is a lesson. Every boss is a story. Every defeat is training. The music makes each encounter feel legendary, and the art direction turns suffering into beauty.
ELDEN RING rewards curiosity, punishes arrogance, and respects intelligent players.

This game is terribly optimized for PC. The fact that I’ve tried around 20 different “solutions” from YouTube videos and Google searches—each promising to make the game playable—says everything. The graphics settings barely matter at all. I can run similar games at 1440p, 60 FPS on medium settings without any issues, yet here even 1080p on low settings can’t deliver acceptable performance.

I can't tell you how much i wanted to give this game a better score.
 Phenomenal world building(literal), phenomenal artwork, great exploration, great gameplay, i very much enjoy the variety of bosses and open world bosses..I died to some of them, i was really in awe, but its faults are too much for me.
The faults:
1) This is the most horrible system in gaming history..Whoever designed that your runes, that you can update your  actual level with, and also buy items with, as a losable resource, should stop working in the industry...
If you die once, you lose your runes on the spot you died.. If you die on the way to collecting the fallen runes, you lose them forever..I can't stretch this enough: It's an open world RPG..The whole point of the game is exploration..''Na, i can't go that way. I am going to die to some bs and lose the runes..'' It's really going against the theme of the game..What were they thinking?

2) The horrible class selection..You can't start as a mage without buying spells first. In my first 15 hours i wandered on the map in search of this mage vendor.. Couldn't find him..I couldn't hold on my runes..because you get it, i would lose them eventually, and so i had to play melee and invest in intelligence while i was getting destroyed by mobs...After the 15 hours passed, i said Ok..Google is my friend...Nice, i don't have a staff.. in 15 hours of gameplay i couldn't find a staff by chance..I was looting everything...Horrible class design choice.

3)Some of the worst questing systems in gaming history..99.99% of the players in this game have not finished the quests without Youtube..You have no questlog..I can't stretch this enough. You have nothing...I have had people suggesting me to take out pen and paper... What?

4)  I dislike with a passion runbacks..After i die..i want to be able to fight the boss again, immediatly...not after 2-3 minutes of running through mobs, maybe dying again...If i die 30 times to a boss, i don't want to waste 40 to 60 minutes on the road.. That's disrespectful of my time..

5) Many of the bosses and mobs run on infinite stamina..and have a handful of combos they simply spam..You can't do any of your own combos..You simply have to hit them in a very small window in which they allow you too..That's all..

6) Yeah, there are some moments when some treasure chest sends you out of nowhere on the other side of the map(so that you can lose your runes)..without being able to teleport back without clearing that specific space with  very overleved mobs..but what can you do?
7) The quests are very simplistic, very forgetable characters, plain narrative, plot..basic..

Still, with all its faults, it's a 7 out of 10..
I still think it's a great game, but these are the things that i find awful..",1767373052,4906.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1245620,True,"This game is about pain and how you learn to enjoy it. This is the kind of game where you'll never give up if you have a goal and a path. My path and goal were Malenia, the Blade of Mikella, and it's an incredible experience when you die and laugh in her face because you'll come back again and again and win. My victory was pure zeal and faith in victory. You're like a general leading his army into battle, and with each attempt you lose a soldier, but you don't lose the battle. In the end, no matter how many people you lose, if the general continued this battle and believed in himself and his army, he will win. For me, the song ""The Winner Takes It All"" by ABBA was special. I carried it throughout Elden Ring. In the beginning, I saw myself as the loser, the one who wasn't even second, the complete loser. In the middle of the game, I was simply suffering, but I could already see myself as the one who took silver, the one who was second. Only after defeating this truly worthy opponent could I recognize myself as the winner. The one about whom they sing, ""The winner takes it all and a loser has to fall.""But now the loser wasn't me, but everyone who bowed before my sword. If you have problems with self-confidence, this game is definitely for you. If you want to prove how cool you are, this game is also for you. Come on in and it will punish you for that assumption.

1245620,True,"THE GOOD:

+ Massive, rich open-world, which doesn't feel empty.
+ Classic FROMSOFTWARE challenge, but now the player has even more freedom to create different characters builds. It's a bit harder than DS3 in terms of bosses IMO.
+ Amazing soundtrack, but not as good as DS3 and DS1 in my opinion.
+ Atmosphere is just amazing in this game. I was fully immersed to this game and its world.
+ HUGE variety of bosses and other different enemies. There's always something new to see and experience. 
+ The visual design and graphics are phenomenal. I played this HDR and ray-tracing enabled. Multiple times during my playthrough I simply stopped moving my character just to admire all the buildings and environments. Elden Ring feels like a proper next-gen game and is something out of this world. 
+ Voice-acting is great. Very high quality and the actors really did a great job in my opinion.
+ Character movement feels great and responsive.
+ Amazing animation work. Pretty much every frame in every animation is well made.
+ Huge amount of content pretty much everywhere you go in this game.
+ Multiple endings (if you do the quests)
+ Integrated map (finally).
+ Elden Ring takes a lot of elements from other FROMSOFTWARE games and improve them. For example, the player messages, co-op, game mechanics and base gameplay is still here from other FROMSOFTWARE games and somehow they are even better in Elden Ring.
+ Has one of the greatest game expansions ever made.
+ This time I played Elden Ring on Windows, but it will also work great on Linux, if you use Steam's Proton compatibility layer.

THE BAD:

- Story and world-building are great, but VERY cryptic. I was literally so confused playing this that I simply watched some lore videos to actually understand what was going on in this world.
- Elden Ring has a tons of crucial quests, which you NEED to track yourself. Meaning, you will not even get any kind of journal which will keep on track who you spoke to and what you have done so far. I literally had to create notebook tab on my phone to actually track these missions because they are crucial for the ending and should not be skipped. These quests also provide a lot of content to the player. This is simply bad game design. Even old-school CRPGs have some king of journal to keep you on track. Elden Ring's quest tracking is simply unnecessarily tedious, cryptic busywork. This was fine in DS games since they are simply smaller games and don't have that many quests compared to Elden Ring. In Elden Ring, this becomes problematic very fast, simply because Elden Ring is very massive game. Pretty much all quests in Elden Ring require some kind of online guide to actually be discovered and completed. Isn't it just so fun to write everything down yourself on every encounter you have with every NPCs?
- Graphical bugs, which are quite annoying. In some open areas the cast shadows and lights flicker a lot, breaking the immersion. This is very random when this flickering happens. Restarting the game fixes this for some odd reason, but may reappear after some time. GPU and other firmware fully up-to-date. 
- They somehow made the targeting system worse compared to other FROMSOFTWARE games. The lock-on is just unreliable and I wasn't able to cycle between enemies in some situations, even though they were the closest to me. The camera in this game is probably the worst I have ever experienced in FROMSOFTWARE game. 
- I'm still not a fan of random PVP encounters. You can't even turn PvP off, if you only want to play PvE while online.
- Has RPG elements (like attribute based leveling, skill system and pretty deep character customization), but lacks deep world-altering dialogue and morality options, which will impact your character, people and the world. It's therefore quite linear game, even though it's a ""rpg"". It's definitely an action-rpg, but if you are looking for ""high-fantasy grand rpg"" game, you should look elsewhere.
- FPS capped to 60FPS

CONCLUSION:

It's great game, pretty much everything a FROMSOFTWARE fan was hoping for. However, it's still not perfect. The biggest drawback is probably the questing system, since it gets tedious to track important quests fully by yourself in such a large world. Online guides are also required to get the most content out of this game, which is a shame.

1245620,False,"Undoubtedly top tier story and worldbuilding. Top tier aesthetics and atmosphere. Very well thought-out RPG elements. All these amazingly well done elements however create the illusion that this game at it's core, is an open world RPG game. But it's not. At it's very foundation it's a rage game, specifically and intentionally designed to frustrate the players and waste their time with an inspirational variety of game mechanics to induce an artificial sense of accomplishment when you defeat some boss / progress through some area. 

Most of the story and the world can be already experienced for free through amazing lore videos made by the community. If you wanna experience these things in game you will have to progress through certain bosses which were (with scary precision) designed to send you back to the checkpoint in various different ways and for some of them the walk-back is minutes long and you can't even multitask by watching a video to the side (or anything like that) since you need to have both hands on the controller/KBM and both eyes on the main monitor because you need to dodge enemies / obstacles just to get back to the boss room. It's simply just a pure, raw, 100% concentrated waste of the player's time.

1245620,False,"Before I start, this was my first souls game, and I will try to pick out elements from the first playthrough, and use my honest opinions. This will be long.

I love fromsoft. all of their games are good, but in what ways are they good? I will pull examples from other games. In Dark souls 3, my personal favorite fromsoft game, the bosses are mostly all good bosses, with some crazy encounters, for example, Pontiff. Dark Souls 1, though not having that strong of a boss lineup in my opinion, makes up for that in crazy encounters such as O&S, Artorias, and Manus, Not to mention the world design that makes that game great in the first half. Dark Souls 2, while having flaws, is one of my favorites due to late-game boss quality such as Fume Knight, Sir Alonne, ivory King, and Elana, not to mention some personal favs of mine like Looking Glass Knight. Elden Ring I feel was a game that was pressured by fans to make harder. Not to discredit souls fans, as hard bosses can be super fun, take Friede from DS3, but when artificial difficulty is introduced, it makes fights less fun, which I will get into later. With this foundation of the game in mind, I feel it good to mention the good parts of the game. Though not as good as DS1 in my opinion, the world design is still pretty cool, but instead of looping levels and genius shortcuts, it is a wide expanse of world for you to explore. The spectacle of some levels are very cool as well. The bosses in this game are mainly focused on spectacle too, and some fights are unmatched in visuals, and comparable to Gael's cinematic visuals. These encounters are great to hype up boss encounters, Especially the main Caelid boss, the spectacle is great. I could go on with some of these encounters. Another one of these is the final boss, which is really great until it falls of hard, which I will talk about later. Just know that the spectacle in this game is great.

To start off the base game with the bad part of it, and I will cover the DLC as a whole later, the bosses are focused on spectacle and not gameplay. The first major boss, Margit, is one of the cooler bosses in my opinion, but my gosh are some of his attacks dumb. Every boss in this game is like pontiff, or a sekiro boss. Unlike those bosses, in Pontiff's case, it is great because 1: he is parriable, so that can easily trivialize the fight, 2: even if you don't parry, he has some openings, though his most common one is tough to learn, and 3: there are only 2 bosses that attack the way Pontiff does, the other one being Friede. Margit isn't the only boss like this, basically every boss in the game is on some sort of drug. I have seen bosses attack me for 25 seconds, and then i get hit for a good 70% of my health at 60 vigor, using hp boosting talismans as well. Some people will say ""use spirit ashes"", and I did on my first playthoughs, and that is the only way I can have fun in this game, as FINALLY, i can get an opening to attack the boss. I have heard people that agree that the bosses attack too much say that daggers are the way to go, as you can get more openings, and I plan to try that out, but I just feel like i have picked the game dry doing a lot. Another big problem with spirit ashes is that the bosses are not balanced around ashes at all. again using margit, I spent 10 hours trying to kill him normally, but when I found out about spirit ashes, I dumpstered him in 5 minutes max. Another problem is the boss hp bars, though most are just fine. The DLC has really facilitated this problem, as most bosses have in excess of 35,000 hp in the dlc. In the base game, the boss with the most hp is a gimmick, and one of my favorites, as it is actually a balanced fight, with a few exceptions. Another boss with a giant hp pool comes when you are around 60-65% done with beating the game, and this boss made me quit on my first playthrough. It is by far one of the most annoying bosses in the game, and that fight alone makes me want to cheese most bosses using bleed, the most busted mechanic in the game, which isn't fun on the fair bosses.

Now moving on to the dlc, I will bundle both the positive and negative aspects into this paragraph, so be warned, this will be long. To start off with the positives, the spectacle, again is great. The elements of the map fit together so well, and the visuals are just great. The whole south of the map looks really cool too, not to mention the Abyssal Woods, one of the coolest levels in the game, and kinda reminds me of a much harder version of Mibu Village from Sekiro. Also like Sekiro, the boss at the end of that level is a great boss, but unlike sekiro, it is my favorite boss in the game. The reason for this is that his fight is very fair, with one move that is annoying to avoid unless you know the trick to dodge it. Though this boss has in excess of 45,000 health, he is an actual fun fight, and the hp doesn't really bother me that much. His attacks are all pretty fair, and that is one of 5 or so bosses that I actually enjoy fighting. The boss at the top of the castle is also pretty cool, and a fun fight, but he suffers from the whole, bosses attack too quickly for me to get a hit in part. The camera in the DLC also works just fine, which is a pleasant surprise. Now moving on to the negatives, the new level up system is dumb. On a first playthrough it is just fine, and encourages exploring, but on repeat playthroughs, I don't want to spend 45 minutes running around the map before I stop getting one-shot by bosses. The first boss I, and many others, encountered first is a taste of what will come. The boss hits like a freight train, has no openings, and unlike many others in the dlc, which i do give them credit for, the camera is utter garbage. The boss has cool attacks, but have fun dodging them, the camera is actively working against you. The next boss I encountered was cool, until the moment I played DS3, where all of the magic went away. That boss, still fun, is a pontiff clone, I'm not kidding. I love pontiff in DS3, and he is one of my favorite base game bosses, but copy pasting him, changing his gender, and giving him an arena wide AoE isn't that fun fromsoft. After that, you encounter covetous demon if it was somehow worse. I know many people hate on covetous demon, and he is way too easy, and has absolute garbage hitboxes, and has a bad arena, I liked him for what he was. In this game, covetous demon clone is guarding 2 upgrade materials, and the worst grab in fromsoft, so have fun. This move is even more pathetic when Lies of P decided to copy this fight and put it in its dlc, even though that one is kinda fun somehow. Moving back to Elden ring, the first required boss, as stated above, was cool. the second one was garbage. Introducing a status effect into the fight is almost never fun, and when it is, it has to be accounted for, which includes not having an arena wide AoE that procs this status effect. The rest of the optional bosses, setting aside the one that I mentioned above that was fair, range from a midir copy but worse, to very annoying, half of all the bosses in this dlc are so annoying that I dont even want to bother killing those bosses, even if it means losing a fragment. The final boss of the DLC is one of the most polarizing bosses i've seen. half of the people say it is fair, and you just have to learn, but the camp i'm in say it's bs. the boss can one shot you if he so desires, and later on in the fight, after effects are cool, just look at Gael or Abyss Watchers, but in this fight, they aren't just confined to the boss, they spread out a good distance away, so if you were healing.... have fun with that. The boss also, you guessed it, had an arena wide one shot AoE, and it also has a two-shot unique grab, which I admit is cool, but all it takes is one slip up, and whoops, there goes your heart. Is the DLC worth 40 bucks, that's up to interpretation, but if it is, maybe don't have another tree sentinel gank please.",1767213077,37852.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

Later, in the frozen lands of the Mountaintops of the Giants, in the Stargazers' Ruins, I encountered a jellyfish spirit who repeated endlessly: ""Sister... Where did you go? You promised me. When we turned 14, we'd go to see the stars... I've been waiting ever so long. Forever and ever it seems"".

That jellyfish spirit couldn't even converse, just murmuring softly to herself, tirelessly repeating the same words. When I summoned the Spectral Jellyfish Ashes, the jellyfish spirit exclaimed happily, ""Ahh, dear sister, you're finally here. No time to waste. Let's see the stars"".

After both jellyfish disappeared, I continued on my way along the cliff beyond the ruins and came to a pair of gravestones inscribed with the words: ""Here lie Aurelia and Aureliette, who never saw the stars"".

Aureliette waited so long, probably even before the Stargazers' Ruins became ruins, waiting for an eternity. Aurelia, my sister in the form of Spirit jellyfish ashes, tearful, tried so hard, searching tirelessly for her home, probably just to fulfill the promise she had made to her sister.

Then I remembered what Roderika said when she gave me the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes: ""And the spirits look rather fondly upon you"".

1245620,False,"ELDEN RING was my long awaited game on steam. I was really excited to play the game, but I wasn't aware with what FromSoftware can offer. So beforehand, I tried Dark Souls and Sekiro first. Sekiro left a huge green flag for me with good writing and incredible gameplay, the game is fast, thrilling, a little bit scary, and most importanly, fun. Unlike Dark Souls, it's almost the opposite of it, leaving me with mixed feeling. But I remain faithful with what ELDEN RING can do and it didn't dissapoint. 

Not only Dark Souls and Sekiro are linear, Elden Ring took a leap forward, making the places accesible in a one huge continent. The exploration in the game is definitely the joy I've been getting through my gameplay. It was a bit overwhelmed honestly, in which way I should be going. It was really fun at first on the early to mid-game. Until late, you can sense see the pattern of each place will be, either there will be a grave, catacombs, a mine or eternal city. It was become a chores rather than curiosity, since you want a better upgrades for Spirit Tuning or Weapon Upgrade. That's why the best part of exploration is when there's a quest related, either to fetch something or find someone. But that's the problem, there are not much of a NPCs that want you to do that in a big open world map. And that's where the problem began.

Many NPCs that you'll encountered that will leave a good impressions are the one that can be found easily. Diallos, D, Rogier, Latenna, Nepheli, Kenneth, Sellen, Tanith, Hewg, Roderika, Rya, Blaidd, Fia, Ranni, Millicent, and maybe Hyetta, anyone you can name it that are not gonna go missing without leaving a clue are the ones that fills the gap of this vast open world, giving a purpose in exploration. I'm that player whenever I beat the boss and done an exploration will comeback to the manor, talk to everyone that may need something to unlock a dialogue for them with how they're doing and what's on their mind, being immersive with the RPG, but the game doesn't really commit that way. I love to talk to the NPCs because they taught me more lore in this cryptic fantasy where it either riddles or a purpose I'm forced to take to. Why the game making it so hard? The QOL is literally over there, if you open the map, it tells which NPC is in that area, but the catch is, it don't. The RPG aspect in this game is also the bare minimum where the answers are either ""yes"" or ""no"", if you picked the wrong one, there are no consequences, you just have to answer it again on the correct one, if it's not the most boring RPG. And it hurts me, because I love these NPC, it satisfy me to found an item this NPC needs through exploration. My god this game doesn't care. But they obviously do because each side quest are pretty long and even brought up from early game to even late game content.

Other part that I really enjoyed was building my character, at once it was just a Dexterity build, but there's a lot of invitation and exciting ability that makes me want to try and at the late game, it was a Faith build. I really like that incantantion and dragon skills, it looks cool honestly rather than useful and I don't mind. I also did endurance build so I can wear the coolest armor and the heaviest, it really is rewarding to explore and fight the bosses. A lot of time I was never really grinding in one spot, moreover it was just full exploring and fighting all the mini bosses and I really like that, the game is big enough instead of just grind. 

The story does confuse me a bit so the best way the game tells me is through POV of other NPC on what they thought about it. It kinda creates a dilemma and which side I should be on. I do like that because at its core, I just want to help everyone with everything, having fun with the NPC, being immersed, and had fun with the exploration.

I really love this game but there's a lot of things that made it repetitive, tedious, and confusing, but the NPCs really made me care about the game and it makes the world more interesting. No I don't recommend people playing it because there's better open world and better RPG, although if you want a better souls-like game, this one is definitely it. But I recommend trying other FromSoftware souls-like first like Sekiro or definitely Dark Souls to get a grasp of what the game has to offer, otherwise you're just in the for the gameplay. And no, I don't care about the combat at all, it's nothing interesting. 8/10.

1245620,True,"To be honest, I was scared to start Elden Ring. I had never played a Souls game before and expected it to be extremely punishing. After dying about ten times in a row to the same boss, I almost quit, but I pushed through, and I’m very glad I did.

The game doesn’t hold your hand and can be quite vague at times. I occasionally had to Google where to go or what to do. That said, the difficulty is balanced by a huge amount of freedom and build variety. You can experiment a lot, and certain builds or summons can make the game much more manageable if you want.

Beating a challenging boss gives an incredible sense of accomplishment. The main bosses are unique and memorable, though side dungeons can feel repetitive, with reused environments and recycled bosses, something I didn’t really enjoy.

Still, the world itself is stunning. Seeing a castle in the distance and realizing you can actually go there never gets old. The level of detail and atmosphere in these areas is fantastic, even if the graphics could be a bit more polished in places.

Overall, I loved my time with Elden Ring. If you enjoy challenging combat and dark fantasy worlds, this game is absolutely worth it. I would rate this game a 10/10.",1767195278,5989.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1245620,True,"So I would start off this by saying I'm not a 'souls' player. I've never followed FromSoftware from the beginning and never played Bloodborne or Dark Souls and don't know if I intend to, so I'm one of the unlikely people to recommend this game for several reasons.


[h2] Graphics and Visual Design [/h2]

In similar vein to previous FromSoftware games, the world of Elden Ring has this really unique what I would describe as 'Super gothic' look. Grandiose cathedrals, castles, massive temples, all with this overt medieval and Christian/religious theme. It is really unique and absolutely beautifully done. What I was really surprised by was how successfully the world was designed so you can enjoy some truly incredible vistas and viewpoints from specific angles based on how you would arrive at a particular area. To control that movement flow in an open world game is not easy and I had some truly 'oh wow that is beautiful' moments in this game. The Lands Between is a unique and diverse place with danger lurking at every corner, but also the lands themselves tell a really vivid story. Initially I thought the tombstones everywhere were a bit morbid but I then realised it is all very deliberate to tell a story. The world of the Lands Between is a broken one, hence why it all feels quiet and dead, but also beautiful in a way one might experience walking through ancient ruins of a once great empire.

[h2] Gameplay and difficulty [/h2]

Ok this is probably where I will get some flack for my opinion. I think the combat 'can' get a little bit ridiculous, especially as a melee combatant. I think my main gripe that I have with the game is not that mobs and bosses hit hard and are very punishing - I've played games like that before and had fun. I don't think it's just about 'getting gud', but rather that there 2 totally different speeds and standards for bosses vs players. Bosses will be moving and hitting at warp speed while players will be limited by very visually cumbersome manoeuvres with animations that won't be able to be interrupted once started. This can make the gameplay quite frustrating at times as it forces a very careful and telegraphed gameplay to ensure you only attack during small windows of opportunity. There were times where I killed bosses during 40+ min fights where I had to dodge perfectly for 8-10 boss hits in a row just to get in maybe 1 quick attack before having to start the cycle again. That to me is not really fun and doesn't allow for a full use of mechanics and it encourages use of cheesy tactics. That being said, the game does give you a variety of ways to approach each boss through thousands of combinations of skills, speels, specs, weapons, builds, talismans, etc. I'm sure with enough research and patience, anyone can end up trivialising a boss by tailoring their approach to that particular boss fight. I would say that on the overall, once I hit a certain level, boss fights became more fun as I felt I had more tools at my disposal to balance out fights, rather than getting annihilated in 2 hits.

I think the combat is not really where the difficulty lies, but in honesty (and again maybe I'm just a filthy casual) but at times I found it frustrating just how little the game tells you about how to achieve things and the ridiculous expectation on players to just 'know' things. The amount of guides and googling I had to do to figure stuff out in this game - it made me wonder how long it would have taken me to figure out on my own. For instance,  (Light Spoilers) - There's 2 medallion halfs you must find before you are able to use a lift to access a certain area. Now I will acknowledge you can bypass the lift through a different path, but when I got to this point there was no indication where those two halfs would be. I happened to stumble upon one because it was in a fairly easy to access Fort but the other half I wouldn't have had a clue were it not for online guides. And that is the case for a lot of stuff in this game. There are truly important and indispensable objects in this game that are hidden somewhere that would be really tricky to find out as a new player on your own. So therefore, unless you enjoy extensive exploration over tens if not hundreds of hours, guides are probably your friend here.

[h2] Exploration and Story [/h2]

These two aspects were my favourite and what made Elden Ring a great game. I mean, when you get George RR Martin to help do the worldbuilding, chances are you will get a truly interesting story. Elden RIng has probably the most extensive, intricate, at times contradicting and yet fascinating stories and lore I have ever seen. Truly unique and complex, if not a bit confusing at times. There are very few cutscenes in this game, with most of the story told through item descriptions, small pieces of dialogues with a handful of NPCs, and through the visual design of the world. You are left to sort of piece together the story through reading items and exploration, which is done really well and gives a real sense of achievement when you get to the bottom of a story. Also, might seem contradictory with what I said earlier in terms of exploration being sometimes needed for really important items, but when it comes to the overall ability to stumble upon amazing places by accident, this game is no joke. I was able to just follow my curiosity and find amazing and incredibly detailed places that were always meant to be discovered in less than obvious ways, and I will always appreciate a game that has the courage to truly reward a sense of curiosity and attention to detail. It is not profitable or easy to justify to create game levels and entire areas that maybe 5% of players will experience, yet Elden Ring achieves that again and again and it truly makes you wonder what other secrets lie around the corner.

[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]

With all that being said, I can totally see the hype, and it is justified. Elden Ring is a truly unique and beautiful game, crafted with love and attention to detail. It is probably one of the few games that really respects the player as an intelligent individual with agency and the game expects a lot from its players. but it also rewards them with a great experience in return. For those who are more casual I would say don't worry too much about boss difficulties. Yes, there were some that made me nearly smash my keyboard, but overall it was a net positive experience. My only wish is that they would just make it easier to find important items and locations in this game and that combat was a bit snappier and faster-paced, but otherwise a really solid game with some of the best world building and visual design out there.",1767179109,5360.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Even within the early area of the game, there are mini-boss characters who absolutely wreck, without the player having a chance apart from staying out of their view. Going into a swampy area and heading toward a small island resulted in a massive dragon that dropped out of the sky and one-shot'd me without so much as a ""Good evening, crunchy!""

 But also this game sucks too. I played 114 hours, my character is nearly 110 level and my sword is at +21 and still they kill me. My damage is average, not bad not good but their damage is extraordinaryh. They kill me with 3 strikes. Even stupid dogs are giving me high damage despite high vigor and sentinel armor. In every game, it become easier when u close to ending but this game is not. It becomes even harder thus it becomes kinda torturing. It feels very wrong after these high hours I am still a noob and there is nothing to avoid that. Like If I wanted to improve I have to go one exact location, but I feel forced even areas before that location despite it's easier. So only way to beat those kinda locations/catacombs is die 100 times and learn every behaviour of the NPCs so maybe u can finish it with luck. It felt good in the beginning but after 110 hours it's not. IT feels stupidly hard, like unneccesarily.

I generally play to finish the story + all the content but this is the first game I will not finish. I ain't gonna torture myself like that dying toı stupid erdtree dogs. Once they give you those dogs as boss then they give you 2 of them. Then they put those bosses as a side NPC enemies and funny thing is damage is still same, I am still fighting like they are boss, and they are still damaging me like they are boss.

1245620,True,"Elden Ring é simplesmente um jogo maravilhoso. Ele representa a evolução natural das mecânicas da trilogia Souls, trazendo uma história cativante que, mesmo após diversos playthroughs, ainda consegue surpreender o jogador com novos detalhes e descobertas. A variedade de builds e ferramentas para superar obstáculos é gigantesca, e a introdução do mundo aberto, algo inovador para a série Souls, foi um grande acerto.

Apesar de eu considerar que o mapa poderia ser um pouco menor, o mundo aberto de forma alguma é um ponto negativo do game. Pelo contrário: se você aprecia cenários e paisagens, ficará maravilhado. O jogo é um verdadeiro espetáculo visual. Claro que Elden Ring possui suas limitações; não é porque o mundo é aberto que ele se tornará algo no estilo Fallout, Skyrim ou GTA. Afinal, trata-se de um jogo da FromSoftware, e ele herda características clássicas do estúdio, como a narrativa fragmentada contada por meio de descrições de itens, diálogos perdíveis e inimigos que resetam suas posições após descansar em uma bonfire.

Outro grande destaque do jogo são as lutas contra os chefes. A maioria dos confrontos, principalmente os da campanha principal, é extremamente memorável. Eles são desafiadores, mas raramente se tornam frustrantes. Além disso, o jogador pode reduzir significativamente a dificuldade ao utilizar os summons, ficando totalmente a critério de cada um decidir se deseja ou não usar essa mecânica. Por se tratar de um jogo de mundo aberto, é natural que algumas batalhas existam apenas para cumprir tabela, mas isso não ofusca em nada o brilho da experiência geral.

Falando de combate e movimentação, o controle do personagem é extremamente fluido. Não houve mudanças drásticas em relação ao Dark Souls 3, com exceção da adição do pulo como mecânica dedicada, uma decisão extremamente acertada. A liberdade de utilizá-lo tanto para esquiva quanto para ataques abre um leque completamente novo de possibilidades durante os combates.

Concluindo, Elden Ring é um jogo incrível. Dá tranquilamente para perder uma vida inteira dentro dele sem explorar todas as possibilidades que oferece. É, sem dúvida, um must-have para quem gosta do gênero: vale cada centavo investido e, principalmente, todo o tempo dedicado.",1767089053,21467.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I feel like this game can be played many times over without getting bored. 
It is however giving me seconds-long lag spikes every now and then, which I dont know where it comes from, whether it's poorly optimization for PC or something running in the background that sets it off. And the game keeps running while the spike happens (not like freeze/lag if GPU was throttling or something, seems more like packet loss spike) so it kind of catches up after a sec or two, so I dont think it's hardware related (1440p, 5700x3d, 32GB ram, rtx 3080).

1245620,False,"Elden Ring is very derivative and not very innovative. It has an empty, unrewarding world filled with meaningless enemies, and tons of copy pasted content. The gameplay feels stale after a while, and the PVP is dead and has no incentives. I didn't often feel satisfied in combat, merely tired and relieved after a victory, as both bosses and enemies have become bloated gankfest messes with aoe spam, 360 degree tracking, and endless combos.

Choice is hampered by enemy stat bloat, forcing a heavy vigor investment even with heavy armor. Enemy drops are often meaningless, and you can fight several miniboss level enemies with little to no reward. The lategame is even worse, where there are very few cool items to uncover, and enemy strength is too high.

The story never felt engaging, and the world doesn't feel compelling. I'm the Elden Lord of a dead world, with almost nobody who isn't a generic zombie, why should I care? Melina, you say births continue, but there isn't a single livable town? It feels too convenient and overdone that everything is a crazed zombie, and attacks you on sight.

I genuinely preferred other soulslikes such as AI:Limit over this. Everything is carried over from past souls games, from stats, to weight and poise systems, enemy animations, souls, bonfire, estus, and even most talismans are just directly taken from past games, almost everything is the same, and doesn't feel unique or fresh.

1245620,True,"Good Game. I like. I have some complaints though. Don't worry most of them are niche.

You guys mostly forgot about Parrying when it came to balancing bosses, didn't you? Like, parrying feels kinda rather odd, more like a memorization of parry windows instead of properly learning the mechanic. Kinda like how a kid memorizes his multiplication tables instead of learning how to properly apply the method (This was me as a child, I am the example). Doesn't really help with the awkward delays some bosses have, or how many bosses need 2-3 parries to be riposted.

Could we also mix up the parry meta? The only parry that feels worth while is Carrian Retaliation, and on occasion, Golden Parry (I would like to state that I absolutely love the sound design for golden parry, could we get another faith-type parry on par with Carrian Retaliation please? It doesn't have to absorb spells or anything, I just want a good parry with that amazing sound design.) The other parries are basically a small shield parry, but ""different"". The default parry is just sad man. I can't even be angry over it. I know it's supposed to be balanced so that a small shield defends against less damage but can parry more attacks than a medium shield, but that doesn't really work when you can just slap Carrian retaliation on a shield and now all are equal.

Horseback combat is under-cooked. Everyone knows this. There isn't much you can do but swing left or right, and I think that's a waste. I know the devs probably had to cut more complex horseback combat to ship the game, but I don't think anyone would mind if they patched it in alongside some horseback npc invasions. I think it could be really fun! Maybe even add a horseback combat option for the arenas!

Please for the love of Marikia, fix the damn camera. Fire giant wasn't difficult for me because of his odd move set, I just couldn't see him because of the camera. It makes the dragons a slog too, and same with the Elden Beast. And that Astiel fellow too. Just make it zoom in and out properly, I beg of you.

Everything after Morgot the Omen King (Absolute Gigachad) kinda feels like a bit of a slog. I think it has to do with the enemy level jumping higher than usual In an area transition. Like the transition from Limgrave to Liurnia of the Lakes felt natural and smooth, but it also felt like I need to gain a few more levels going from Lyndell to the mountaintops of the giants felt like I was at least twenty levels under prepared. I suppose that it doesn't really help that by that point you are at like what, weapon level 24-25? I think Fromsoft had used the same method they had for the early game area transitions but forgot to incorporate the fact that because this was the end game, upgrades and levels would be significantly more scarce to come across. The Haligtree npcs are just overpowered, I was at like level 175 and 80 dex with a +25 Longsword before I felt like the Limgrave guys when I was properly leveled for that area.

Speaking of the Haligtree, Malania Blade of Miquilla is NOT a balanced boss. Don't let anyone gaslight you into believing she is. Unless of course she's balanced for you and two co-operators, then maybe I could see that. But coming from a guy who spent 10 hours trying to beat her, I can tell you she IS NOT. I learned a new playstyle (Blade and Incant) to use the Aspects of the crucible incantations for stagger, and it still didn't work. Eventually I just upgraded an utichkatana to +24 with a bleed infusion and jumped her in a back ally with my mimic tear and a bunch of frost pots. Still took a few tries, but it was kinda funny. I ended up walking away from that boss feeling a bit disappointed, like I had wasted my time. Yes, I know she's an optional boss, but did you really play the game if you didn't fight her? She is THE boss people think of when they hear elden ring after all. What did you spend all that money for?

Alright, I'm done ranting without giving constructive criticism. The biggest offender in Malenia's moveset is her waterfowl dance (big surprise, I know). It wouldn't be as big of a deal if she had a minimum distance she had to be from the player before she engaged the dance, or heck, if she couldn't cancel her hit stun to start this move to blend you at point blank. I don't really mind any of her other moves, and I think her heal gimmick is pretty cool. Yeah, I said it. I think Malenia have a good moveset with the sole exception of waterfowl dance. Although I do wish she wasn't able to chain 3 Rapid Prosthesis Slices in a row. I think most people would be fine with her if her waterfowl dance felt fair.

Now to remind people that I do actually recommend this game. This is actually my first souls like, and as such, my opinion is untainted as possible. The only thing I had ever played before that was even close to Elden Ring was Breath of the wild, and as you can guess, Elden ring FAR exceeds it in terms of quality. Every major Dungeion feels unique, the boss variety is incredible (though there are some issues with reused bosses). The bosses in the 1st 2/3rds of the game are generally well-made, and the open world, is incredible. I do wish there were more gimmick bosses though. Rykard was especially fun for me (though I do have an issue with visual over stimulation in his second phase), and I thought Renalla was pretty interesting as well, as it was a fun deviation from the dodge rolling during her first phase. You guys should really include more gimmick bosses in later games.

However, why are madness and deathblight completely useless outside of PVP? now mind you, on the topic of deathblight, no one thinks it should be an instant kill on tougher enemies and bosses. I do however think it should insta-kill lesser foes, like basic soldiers, and maybe rats, or dogs. You could have it work either like bleed or like frostbite. If you want the bleed method, just have it take longer to proc, but deal more damage. I've seen other people online suggest that it could work more like frostbite, where you proc it and it deals damage and a debuff. I kinda like the frostbite method more. Have it take longer to proc, and let it deal more damage than frostbite while dealing a significant amount of stance damage. Also add it as a Faith-Dex infusion for the sacred whetblade, kinda like how Flame art is Faith-strength, so that it matches the eclipse shotel.

And for madness, just have it affect npcs. The rats have flaming eyes, so we all know it doesn't go against the lore.

In conclusion: Fun game, would recommend. Malenia is such a disliked boss of mine that I cannot find her sexually attractive. Please make a deathblight infusion and have it do things in PVE.

1245620,True,"Pretty sure everyone already knows how good Elden Ring is and no one needs to hear details they've heard again and again from more credible, unbiased critics/reviewers.

Elden Ring along with BG3 and recently Exped33 are literally era defining games that have really changed the way I look at games recently. Been buying games in the past few Steam Sales, but I find myself defaulting back BG3 or Elden Ring when I get tired of grinding out achievements in the new games I play. It's like I can't even enjoy mindless fun anymore, because I keep seeing games (especially RPG and Souls genre ones) with these 2 as a point of comparison. 

As a Souls game, it is probably a very good entry point for beginners to the genre with its summon and ash of war mechanic. Builds are able to carry you in this game if you lack execution usually demanded by Souls type games. Build variety is also very extensive due to the introduction of the AoW system and the game has an extensive spell list, which make replayability one of its strongest draw. The world itself is expansive and there are a lot of things to fight making build testing/multiple playthroughs a lot of fun.

And it is the most accessible game yet, although for a newcomer, it WILL still be challenging.

It's honestly one of my favorite games of all time, for everything. The lore, the gameplay, the worldbuilding, the level design, the characters, the music... Everything is so damn good.

I start the game and everthing looks pretty bad, okay some tweaks to the settings usually works.
So I go into display settings to find it's running in 2560x1440 when it should be 3440x1440.

It's actually refreshing to play a game where I don't have to download mods in order to declutter my HUD from a plethora of waypoints that tell me exactly where to go and what to do when I get there. 

That being said, one of Elden Ring's faults is a lack of an in game journal of some kind where you can reference back on quest lines you may have only just barely started 20 hours ago before running off in some other direction. Something along the lines of Morrowind's would be great. It still isn't holding your hand per se, but you can be sure that the important information is at hand. Technically this does exist in some form in some cases, so long as you remember to look at the particular item in your inventory or talk to a certain NPC that can nudge you back on track but it's still heavily reliant solely on player memory.

Elden Ring is the only game where I can confidently say I was emotionally supported by a jellyfish and emotionally destroyed by a goat. I set out to become the Elden Lord; instead, I became a full‑time employee of the “You Died” screen.
The open world is gorgeous—so gorgeous that I kept stopping to admire the scenery, which is exactly when a random bird the size of a Honda Civic decided to end my career.

Even story bosses aren't exent of being copy pasted despite of their unikeness. The cobat is really good, this is the most fun i had with  combat in the souls series, there are a ton of variety of weapons armors, playstyles.

I have been a fan of Elder Scrolls. I love the map of ES5, but the dungeons are so repetitive that I get bored very quickly. The Elden Rings offers a different experience. Although the map may not be as large, the dungeons are souls-like design. Every dungeon is unique and challenging. You never get the same experience on different locations.
Similar dungeons on different locations are essentially the same thing but waste players' time. It discourages exploration and get me frustrated. Although the map is not the largest among open-world games, the Elden Ring actually offers more playable contents.

A major upgrade from previous Dark Souls series is that you can customize skills on weapons. In Dark Souls 3, every weapon has a built-in skill which cannot be changed. This is redicules since skills are just martial art moves the character can perform. Why they are affiliated with weapons? If I can perform a quickstep, is it because I equipped a straight sword then I can't? Sometimes I had to use some weak weapons for the skill. Sometimes I had to swap weapons to swap skills - which can be done just by clicking another ability key in other games. The Elden Ring solves the first problem by enabling customization of skills. I hope the second can be resolved in the next game.",1766966661,58092.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I remember finding this huge underground cave system that, while very pretty, I searched for at least an hour and found nothing. After several other times of something like this happening, I would explore the world and find nothing or something I had to clue what to do with, I concluded that exploring the world was a waste of time with very little in terms of reward.

I did have fun defeating margit. But as the game got more and more difficult I found that the only way I knew how to cope was to grind one enemy over and over again to level up my character. Eventually the enemies got so difficult that the amount I needed to grind that one enemy seemed not worth it and I gave up. After talking to other people who played this game say that was not their experience, maybe I missed some very important game play element, but honestly the game just seemed to repetitive. Find a boss learn it's patterns or grind runes to defeat it repeat.

1245620,False,"Since I had some unfinished business in the DLC, I came back to this game after a long hiatus. Taking that break made the issues in this game even more glaring. I'm giving this game a 10/10 for lore, exploration, and world design, though the latter feels a bit empty for its size. But gameplay-wise, FromSoftware took their games in the wrong direction ever since Dark Souls 3, with its super aggressive and fast enemies, only to dial this up to 11 in Elden Ring.

I think having more consistency would do the next game some good. Meaning:

* A working poise system (again).
* Clear attack patterns without those long-winded combo streaks.
* Reaction-based dodging instead of instant attacks that come out of drawn-out wind-ups.
* Clear punish windows.

The late game also turns into a slog. Having bosses you've fought before and some new ones only this time they deal a ton of damage and have massive health pools. This is not challenging; it is exhausting to fight.

And of course there is a wide selection of weapons and consumables, especially spirit ashes (summons you can call into a boss fight or certain areas) that trivialize some fights massively. But what was the point of making boss fights artificially difficult in the first place then? Meaning: almost undodgeable attacks, massive damage, massive health pools, endless combos, high mobility that leaves very little time for the player to punish the boss, if they can even get to them in the first place, that is. It's like there is no middle ground here anymore, which could have been achieved with fine-tuning all boss encounters. But it's clear what they did here instead: go mass over substance.

It is still a great game, just not the best souls-like they've made so far. And as you can see by my hours played, I still got a massive amount of enjoyment in return for the money spent. But Steams rating system has no stars so I'll go with the negative one. If the FromSoftware games are more about the lore and the exploration for you (just like me), then I'd still recommend this game. If it is challenge you seek, then the other FromSoftware titles will be more enjoyable, in my opinion.",1766869054,37662.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.5

1245620,True,"Elden Ring – A Game That Stays With YouSome games are fun. Some games are memorable. And then there are games like Elden Ring—games that change the way you feel about gaming forever.From the moment I stepped into the Lands Between, I knew this was something special. Not because the game held my hand or explained everything, but because it trusted me. It trusted me to get lost, to fail, to learn, and to grow. Every step forward felt earned. Every victory, no matter how small, felt powerful.Elden Ring doesn’t just challenge your skills—it challenges your patience, your curiosity, and your courage. You will die. A lot. But instead of feeling unfair, the game teaches you. Each defeat pushes you to try again, smarter and stronger. And when you finally defeat a boss that once felt impossible, the feeling is unmatched. It’s not just winning—it’s overcoming yourself.The world is breathtaking. The Lands Between feel alive, mysterious, and ancient. Every castle, cave, and open field tells a story without saying a single word. Sometimes I would stop playing just to look at the sky, the trees, or a distant tower and think, “How can a game be this beautiful?” Exploration feels rewarding because you never know what you’ll find—danger, secrets, or moments of pure wonder.What makes Elden Ring truly special is its atmosphere. The music, the silence, the loneliness, and the epic moments all blend together perfectly. It makes you feel small in a broken world, yet important enough to change it. The story isn’t told directly—but when you piece it together, it feels personal, like you discovered it yourself.Elden Ring is not just a game I played. It’s a journey I experienced. It taught me patience, determination, and that failure is not the end—it’s part of the path forward.I love this game from the bottom of my heart.

1245620,False,"i genuinely don't know how people have come to the conclusion that this is a 10/10 game.

for any non Miyazaki glazer, this game has glaring design decisions that serve no purpose other than to make the game Hard with no justifications other than... tradition?

Fromsoft has not really innovated their game design in 10yrs.
really nothing has changed & that's sad guys. 
you shouldn't settle for the same shit over and over.
a game shouldn't waste your time so thoroughly as this does.
a game shouldn't hide important features from you that make it so that you HAVE to go lookup basic information outside of the game.
when you put down a game you should be able to point out what specific parts made you enjoy it.

now, i wanna take a moment to emphasize that i said hard, not difficult.
that is because difficulty implies complexity, a challenge, a puzzle to overcome, or something to learn.
think boss fight patterns, or stat scaling, these are all things you can exert control over, and work towards overcoming.
that is where the difficulty comes from.
that is where challenge comes from and that feeling of triumph.

- when you have to jump off a cliff, because there is no way down and you die because fromsoft decided that 5ft is enough to be lethal fall damage... there's no challenge, it just sucks. there is no 'git gud' and really there's not much incentivization to get your runes back.
- when you get intrigued by a snek girl quest and want to follow it through to it's end but can't because the questline dialogue is ambiguous as it can be, because for some reason fromsoft has decided to write their dialogue like they purposefully want people to NOT understand... it's not challenging, there is no logical conclusion. there's no pattern to follow. Rya disappears after a certain point in the quest.... and you just have to find her.... why? who approved this?

that out of the way... the soul-crushing difficulty that is part of these game's charm is obviously not the issue.
you can have your struggle session game where it makes your pussy feel tremendous every time you finally beat a boss after 30hrs of effort AND there can be new shit to do besides.... grind and kill more enemies for runes.
you can have questlines that don't take a cypher or a 15 minute guide to understand.

you can have all this and it still be a souls-like, it can still be challenging, and you can still be innovating and implementing new game mechanics.",1766789812,430.0,True,False,False,5,0,0.4970059692859649

This is also supported by the soundtrack, which not only creates relaxing anticipation during exploration, but also makes grandiose battles legendary. 

The amount of ways you can take on your enemies is staggering and the amount of opportunities and help you get compared to other games of the genre is unmatched. 
This alongside the number of different and interesting areas and locations you get to visit makes a really colorful adventure, filled with possibilities.

The game has a fantasy setting and instead of a story game, we get a lot of lore and optional side missions.

Listen well, fellow Tarnished
for I speak not with arrogance… but with certainty.

I have fallen.
I have bled.
I have stood before foes who thought themselves gods.

And yet
I am still here.

The Lands Between test us with blades, with sorcery, with despair itself. They whisper that we are unworthy, that we were cast out for a reason. But tell me this

Who decided that?

Was it the gods who hid behind thrones?
Was it fate, trembling at our approach?

No.

For every time death claimed me, I rose.
Every time the world said kneel, I stood taller.
Not because I was chosen
but because I refused to yield.

Fear?
I acknowledge it… and walk past it.

Failure?
It sharpens me.

Gods?
If they stand in my path
then they will learn what it means to face a Tarnished who does not bow.

Remember this, my fellow Tarnished:

You do not challenge the Erdtree because you are strong.
You are strong because you challenge it.

Stand proud.
Carry your scars like crowns.
And if the world dares ask who you are

Tell them:

I am no pawn of fate, no servant of gods.
I walk where the world fears to tread,
and in my steps, I carve the ending itself.",1766730325,1034.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The great Elden Ring was shattered.

In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.

and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was the first to perish.

Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.

The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.

A war from which no lord arose.

A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.

Arise now, ye Tarnished.

Ye dead, who yet live.

The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.

Hoarah Loux, chieftan of the badlands.

The ever-brilliant Goldmask.

Fia, the Deathbed Companion.

The loathsome Dung Eater.

And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.

And one other. Whom grace would again bless.

1245620,True,"Elden Ring is a breathtaking achievement that blends challenge, freedom, and discovery into one unforgettable experience. From the moment you step into the Lands Between, the game invites curiosity with its vast open world, mysterious landmarks, and striking art direction. Every region feels distinct and thoughtfully designed, encouraging exploration without ever holding the player’s hand. The sense of wonder that comes from cresting a hill and seeing a new area unfold is one of the game’s greatest strengths.

The gameplay is deep, rewarding, and highly flexible, allowing players to approach challenges in many different ways. Whether you prefer careful strategy, fast-paced combat, or experimenting with different builds and abilities, Elden Ring supports it all. Battles feel intense but fair, and overcoming difficult enemies delivers a strong sense of accomplishment. The freedom to explore, level up, or simply go somewhere else if things feel too tough makes the experience feel empowering rather than frustrating.

Beyond mechanics, Elden Ring excels at atmosphere and storytelling. Its lore is subtle and intriguing, revealed through environments, characters, and small details rather than long explanations. This approach makes the world feel ancient and lived-in, rewarding players who pay attention and piece things together themselves.

1245620,False,"I will never understand the Souls-like genre. Everybody seems to love it. I get recommended these games multiple times a year and yet every time I try one, it feels like the same experience all over again.

When Dark Souls 1 and 2 were still a novelty I actually UNDERSTOOD the appeal. “The point is that it doesn’t handhold you” great. That made sense at the time. But this genre has been run into the ground. Over and over it’s the same setting, the same tone, the same ""mythic past"" or ""bleak dark future"" where the bloodied, tarnished, vanquished whatever must fight Eli the All-Mighty Executioner to prove their worth. It’s creatively stagnant.

What really loses me is the design philosophy. What skill is actually being tested when you’re ambushed constantly, die, respawn and then simply remember where the traps are? That isn’t ""skill"" it’s memorisation. By that logic Far Cry 3 is a Souls-like because you die once, then know where the pirates are next time and sneak up on them. Maybe I just don't GET it.

The genre is also an oxymoron. Souls-likes are constantly framed as niche, hardcore experiences, yet they are massively popular. They sell millions, dominate charts and dozens of them release every MONTH. That isn’t niche. The appeal often seems less about fun or creativity and more about being able to say “I did it or something.”

I’m not here to trash THIS specific game. Elden Ring is clearly well-made and crafted by the original architects of the genre. But Souls-like games have been mythologised to such an extreme degree that they can never realistically deliver what people claim they do. They don’t meaningfully prove skill, they don’t offer an especially interesting challenge and for me, they’re rarely fun.

It’s just not my cup of tea. I'll keep it in my library to play on rainy days.

Evet, üstte belirttiğim gibi. Zor, bir o kadar da güzel bir oyun. Yoran, bir o kadar da haz veren bir oyun. İstanbul misali. 

Elden ring her şeyden önce muazzam dövüş mekanikleri olan, mükemmel atmosferi bulunan, zorlayıcı, etkileyici bir oyun diyerek başlamak isterim. Gaming dünyasının olmazsa olmazı gibi bir oyun bu. Soulslike’ı sevdirecek boyutlarda başarılı. Fakat öyle bir sıkıntısı var ki, siz sormayın ben söylemeyeyim. 

Oyunda bir mod kurulumu yardımıyla duo oynayabiliyorsunuz. Fakat bunun bir dezavantajı olacak. Eğer duo’ysanız, sürekli oyun dünyanızın raid yemesine hazır olun. Bu raidler o kadar saçma, o kadar aptalca ki, tüm oyunun güzelliğini gölgeliyor adeta. 

Anlamlandıramadığım bir şekilde pvpsi her daim laglı. 10000 megabit internete de sahip olsan, vuruşlar hep laglı bir şekilde rakibe gidiyor. Vurduğun halde canını azaltamıyorsun. İşin PvP kısmında dodge sisteminde sıkıntı var. 

Daha da garibi, bu raid esnasında gerçekleşen PvP düellosunun, hiçbir şekilde adil olmayışı. Gelen kişi itemsel ve level olarak sizden çok da güçlü oluyor. Bundan da saçması, siz bir boss fight’ının ortasında raid yiyorsunuz ve eksik pot’la oynamanız gerekiyor. Sırf bu sebeple oyuna dislike atasım var, ama bunu yapmadım. Çünkü bu, haksızlık ve duygularımla hareket ederek yaptığım bir puanlama olurdu.

1245620,True,"Really enjoy the game. I play it on a laptop not meant for gaming and so there was the added difficulty of a pretty bad pc port which has very slow input lag and control drift, in addition to stuttering and whatnot, but enemies and bosses are mostly doable as long as they are predictable. Once I got a controller, everything became much easier due to more responsive controls and whatnot, even on this potato laptop.

Some critiques:
1. Some of the level and arena designs are quite poor in that they present difficulties unrelated to the game mechanics but are purely technical such as giant bosses in tiny arenas which lead to cameras constantly clipping into the walls and the boss itself
2. These poor design issues combine with poor controls to create situations where you are really fighting against your own PC and camera rather than the boss itself, which can be a challenge in itself but not the enjoyable point of this game.

1245620,True,"Elden Ring is likely one of, if not, the best games I've ever played. The spectacle, the feeling of victory - the grandiose of it all truly feels like a once in a lifetime experience. I fear I will never play a game as marvelous as ELDEN RING.

Elden Ring is a beautiful, yet cruel game that rewards persistence and grit; the stunning world you enter is violent, unforgiving, and harsh... Yet the player persists. The sense of accomplishment that comes when you finally conquer a challenge you'd been stuck on, or finally clear a dungeon/castle is something I've never experienced in a game before. 

Elden Ring is the definition of a legendary journey. You will face overbearing hardship across the wide, open world that is The Lands Between, with each of its distinct regions posing different challenges.

In Caelid, you'll be challenged by vast amounts of dragons and putrid, rotten creatures. Liurnia of the Lakes will have you battling mages and spirits, while the Mountaintops face you with snowy trolls and giant crows. Each region is distinctly difficult - and the vastness of the open world poses a new challenge at every turn.

The vastness of The Lands Between is complimented greatly by the diverse array of challenges presented all throughout. In each crevice, you'll find catacombs to conquer, a hidden boss, or an NPC you've never seen. The world of Elden Ring is full of things to see - each testing your persistence and skill.

Elden Ring is without a doubt, a MASTERPIECE - not because it is forgiving, but precisely the opposite. Elden Ring is a test of determination and persistence; completion is proof of struggle - and I love a good challenge.",1766413297,12111.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.5

I liked Sekiro and Bloodborne and to a lesser extent DS1, 2 and 3, but I just found this to be dragged out way too much, be way to focused on making specific builds and so much essential stuff being hid around the massive world. It was just too much and not explained in any way. 

Often losing track of what you were supposed to do when sidetracked by some dungeon, and often you find yourself in areas that you are way underleveled for. Last part was especially aggregios to me, because the game felt more like a mmorpg grind rather than a souls-experience. Also, a ton of essential stuff is hidden in dungeons or other maps that are theoretically ""optional"".

At the end, I just wanted the game to be over so I could call it a day and not feel like I wasted my money, but that is more on me and my stubbornness I guess. Felt relief to be done with the bosses more so than accomplishment like I did with other entries. Especially because some had cutscenes you had to skip every time, some had annoying walk-backs, and others had annoying, tedious first phases.

1245620,True,"I love this game so much in so many ways, but at times it's a very love hate relationship. Going into it, I felt the game was overhyped, and even several hours hours in, I still felt that way and was close to dropping it. Then something clicked, and I can wholeheartedly say that yes, this game does deserve the hype, and I cannot recommend it enough.

This was my first FromSoftware game, and I do not think I will be playing another, not because this one was unenjoyable but just because I'd like to keep this as the standard of soulslike I got to experience, and the open world Elden Ring offers, from my understanding, isn't offered in the other games. In many moments, Elden Ring felt like the perfect game, however it does have its flaws, so I guess it isn't a perfect game? I feel the first playthrough of this game is something that you'll never quite be able to capture the feeling of again, in all the right ways. 

The game’s lore is deep, but its story is not told through a traditional main storyline narrative. Instead, the player needs to put together pieces gathered through NPC dialogue, world exploration (environmental details), and item descriptions. Additionally, there is no quest log, and little guidance on where to go or what to do next. Even after completing my first playthrough, I still did not have a solid understanding of the story, and most of what I know now came from external sources. However, that's not to say I wasn't picking up what the game was putting down. Interestingly, when I replayed the opening cutscene in New Game+, it felt completely new because of how much I had learned during my first playthrough. The more you understand the world, the more rewarding exploration and side content become. However, you are probably not playing Elden Ring for its story, but for its gameplay and challenge. 
In my opinion, the world is the game’s greatest achievement. It is massive, detailed, and genuinely feels alive. The art direction is stunning, with a wide range of distinct regions, and for the first time since games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and CD Projekt RED titles, I felt truly immersed again. There is a constant urge to want to keep exploring and see what the world has to offer.

However, the beauty of the world comes with a steep initial hurdle. The lack of direction makes it easy to spend hours exploring without feeling like you have made any real progress. My first 10 hours were spent wandering aimlessly, and that nearly made me quit. It was only after following guides to understand where to go and how to build my character that the game opened up. Once it did, exploration became far more satisfying, though I still frequently looked things up, from build optimization to hidden bosses. 
The combat and boss fights are what the game is best known for, and overall, they deliver. The game offers strong build variety through weapons, spells, talismans, and skills, and most playstyles are viable. You can also respec your character's skill points later on, which allows for experimentation. While the game is challenging, I do not think it is as punishing as its reputation suggests. Most bosses took me fewer than 10 attempts, and if something felt impossible, there was always the option to explore more, level up, and return stronger. In that sense, the player has some control over the game’s difficulty.

That said, the combat is not without issues. There is a noticeable difficulty spike in certain late game areas where even regular enemies deal excessive damage. Some encounters feel unfair rather than challenging, with stun locking enemies or poorly designed bosses. Many large bosses suffer from awkward hitboxes or fights that revolve around chasing them for extended periods, which is simply not enjoyable. Unfortunately, even the final boss falls into this category. Enemy aggression also became a constant annoyance, with enemies chasing far beyond what feels reasonable. 
Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the base game enough to buy the DLC at full price. Visually, it lives up to the base game’s world design, but the difficulty is noticeably higher, and exploration feels tense rather than rewarding. Many of the combat issues present in the base game are amplified here, and the frustration often outweighed the enjoyment.

The DLC bosses are not difficult in a satisfying or engaging way, but instead feel frustrating and exhausting. Difficulty and challenge do not automatically translate to good boss design or enjoyment. Rather than feeling creative or well-paced, they often rely on constant aggression, excessive attack chains, oversized AOEs, and very limited openings. It felt like Many encounters came down to dodging insanely well only to be rewarded with like two seconds to retaliate, which quickly becomes draining.

To be clear, I beat the main bosses in the DLC and then more, which I feel is important to say given how often criticism is dismissed on the basis of skill. If this style of design works for you, then that is completely valid, but for me, it made many fights feel more annoying than challenging. While the DLC does include one of my favorite bosses in any game I have played, Rellana, the overall boss design direction was disappointing.

I would only recommend the DLC to players who truly loved the base game and want to experience everything it has to offer. If not, I would say skip the DLC, leave it at the base game.",1766276568,6994.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.5

1517290,False,"Battlefield 2042 didn’t just have a bad launch — it feels like a game that never really understood what made Battlefield work in the first place.

Yes, the launch was rough: bugs, missing features, poor performance. Some of that was patched later. But even now, the core problems are still there. The maps are too large and empty, matches feel chaotic instead of tactical, and teamwork matters far less than it used to.

The Specialist system is a big part of the problem. It removes clear class roles and turns Battlefield into something closer to a hero shooter, which just doesn’t fit this franchise. Instead of improving the formula, it waters it down.

Post-launch support also feels late and reactive. Major fixes only arrived after a large part of the player base had already left, which makes it hard to trust the game as a long-term multiplayer experience.

Battlefield 2042 may be more stable now than at launch, but “more stable” doesn’t mean “good.” It still doesn’t deliver the Battlefield experience many players expected.

Do not buy this at full price. Even at a discount, know what you’re getting into. This feels less like a failed patch cycle and more like a failed direction.",1767423555,2335.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5213410258293151

1517290,True,"This is my first ever battlefield game and man oh man, is this game good. I'm not a PVP fan so I verse bots in conquest solo/co-op mode, heaps of fun, especially on that map where it's indoors inside a dome mostly dark. REALLY good game this, highly recommend.

I was wondering whether to get this or Battlefield 6 but seeing this game, you can verse bots, that is good enough for me, I'm happy. I give this game a perfect score of a 10/10 and a 5/5.

I have a few favourite shooter games but I think this may very well become my new favourite.

When I tried out the conquest mode, very similar to Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2, capturing zones, defending etc. But seriously, this game was worth getting, it's so addictive lol.

UPDATED REVIEW: 17/12/2025

I had a look at the trailers and gameplay of Battlefield 6 and apparently, players are having performance issues and disconnections from servers, also game crashes on startup. This is my first Battlefield game so I cannot say which one is the best one to buy if your looking for a good shooter game?

Battlefield 6 is good if your a PVP player. Then Battlefield 2042 if you want the option of either doing PVP or fighting against AI/bots. You do earn XP through versing bots but at a reduced amount which doesn't bother me, I play purely for fun. If I recall correctly, you can verse bots/AI in co-op still in 2025 which is really good so heaps fun if you have friends or family.

I did check out Battlefield 6 but honestly, I prefer this one, to me, far better than Battlefield 6 but hey, that's just me lol. You do unlock things as you play more and more, especially doing objectives.

Battlefield 2042, okay, I have to admit, this is my new favourite shooter game, hands down. Something about it, it never get's boring.

My word of advice, if you wish to do PVP but cannot handle it. I myself have been burnt through PVP personally but it's always good to mute mic, turn off others audio, don't respond in text chat etc, don't respond, not even once. What trolls hate most is when you don't respond and if you respond with fire against fire, it really stirs things up and that is what they love most, to see you struggling. Do not listen or even give them attention, they can try another person. PVP is fine if you ignore everyone and simply play the game. Now, I used to love PVP, not anymore because of past hurts. But anyways...

Great game, looking forward to seeing if I can play any other Battlefield games.",1765878450,385.0,True,False,False,17,2,0.6984844803810119

I haven't played this game when it was launched, it caught my eyes when BF6 proved to be a terrible disappointment because of EA's stupid mentality of catering to COD players/streamers instead of caring about the game.

I don't really feel like I'm playing Battlefield; the recycling of maps and other elements really shows that Dice didn't put much thought into making this game. The fact that the game doesn't have a campaign is really evidence of the lack of budget that EA gives to develop a game. The fact that Dice gives us access to the Portal mode, which is just crude recycling so that players can try to create content to make up for the lack of content in the game... The Hazard Zone mode is just a simple extraction mode without any content in the maps and without any real fights against actual players. Sure, I’m clearly not the target audience for this type of game mode, but offering such a thing is shameful in terms of gameplay. We can also talk about the countless bugs we encounter during our matches that still haven't been fixed even after 4 years after the game's release, the game is extremely poorly optimized, especially considering the graphics that don’t exactly blow us away.

The gameplay is fast, intense, and not predictable. There is always something happening on the maps. Some fight inside buildings, others drive tanks or fly helicopters. The fights are strong, and the situation can change in a few seconds. Sometimes the weather makes it hard to see or forces players to move, which makes the game more exciting. The game gives a lot of freedom. You can play aggressively, help your team, or act alone. It all depends on the player's style and the chosen specialist.

Is it worth it? Definitely yes.",1764522312,1265.0,True,False,False,19,2,0.6815891861915588
1517290,False,"Although improved since launch, BF2042 marks a low point for the Battlefield franchise. Bizarre development choices make this entry feel so out of place that it hardly resembles a Battlefield game. Although I have given the game a chance, I am still dealing with bugs that make it quite a tedious experience. 

I can never open the game successfully on the first try. I have to open the game, close it and then launch it once again otherwise I'm faced with an endless beeping satellite cutscene. I also struggle to play with friends as we can't stay in the same lobby from match to match. We are instead forced back to the menu and we have to invite each other every single time.

To make matters worse, there is no campaign. That alone is not a dealbreaker for me but if they go down the route of solely focusing on multiplayer, you would want it to be near flawless and polished, which it isn't. 

Skip this one, there are better alternatives.

+General in game graphics. For once they didn't desaturate and make every environment as unpleasing to look at as possible. Before we take a wrecking ball to everything the maps look nice.
+Gun play. The gunplay feels more like the far older battlefields except smoother. its actually more reliable and consistent. Your weapons don't feel quite so unpredictable like they do in the other more recent titles.

1517290,True,"Battlefield 2042 – Review

At launch, Battlefield 2042 arrived with ambition but stumbled under the weight of its own contradictions. Set in a near-future world ravaged by climate disasters and geopolitical collapse, the game promised a bold reimagining of the iconic franchise: dynamic weather systems, globe-spanning maps, 128-player battles (on supported platforms), and the removal of traditional classes in favor of the Specialist system.

Visually, 2042 is stunning—maps like Orbital (French Guiana) and Discarded (Antarctica) showcase DICE’s mastery of scale and environmental storytelling. The Hazard Zone mode experimented with tactical extraction gameplay, while Portal offered fans a creative sandbox to relive moments from Battlefield 1942, Bad Company 2, and 3.

However, the game launched with significant issues: minimal narrative context, a shallow Specialist system that felt more like reskinned loadouts than meaningful roles, and a glaring absence of features expected in a modern shooter—no campaign, no voice chat at launch, and limited AI support for squad play. Server instability and balancing problems further eroded player trust.

Over the following years, EA and DICE committed to a “Season 0” reset, overhauling core mechanics, reintroducing class-like roles, and improving map design based on community feedback. By 2024, Battlefield 2042 had evolved into a more cohesive and enjoyable experience—but for many, the damage was done.

Verdict: A technically impressive yet deeply flawed entry that struggled to honor its legacy. It’s a game that could have been great—but only became competent long after players had moved on. For die-hard fans willing to forgive its rocky start, 2042 now offers chaotic, large-scale warfare with moments of genuine brilliance. But it remains a cautionary tale about launching too soon and listening too late.

i liked the gun play but its not the best, too (as for the best, it is bf1), good mechanics (almost everything is similar to bf4 for me, including specialists), a lot of guns including ones from bc2 and bf3, good and underrated maps which are really nice for vehicles but mostly poor for infantry (obviously there are maps like redacted and stuff, but most of the maps are too open). what is bf2042 getting disliked mainly for are specialists
specialists are not the same specialists as on release featuring just.. specialists? and no class system, which was added later. right now its absolutely the same as bf4 class system except its worse, it really is (and the skins) 
the graphics are pretty good, there is enough destruction,  wish there were levolutions too ((

The early experience delivered unpredictable moments and ridiculous vehicle plays that everyone loved, even if it wasn’t polished.

A few months later the patches toned things down. The vehicle changes removed a lot of that launch-era craziness, and while the gunplay was decent, it felt more arcade-like and less true to classic Battlefield roots. After that, I stepped away from the game for about a year.

Coming back right before BF6 released, the game was in a much better place. It felt more balanced, more stable, and surprisingly captured the Battlefield vibe well enough to hold me over until the next game dropped.

1517290,True,"Battlefield 2042 is a first-person shooter developed by DICE and released in 2021. Set in a near-future global conflict, it abandons the series’ historical and modern-war settings for a high-tech battlefield featuring advanced gadgets, dynamic weather, and massive player counts. It was designed to showcase next-generation scale and chaos but launched with significant issues that affected its reception.

The game features 128-player matches on large, open maps, emphasizing vehicle warfare and player freedom. Traditional classes were replaced by a new “Specialist” system, where each character has unique abilities and equipment. This shift aimed to encourage flexibility but diluted team roles, reducing the tactical coordination that defined earlier Battlefield titles.

Core gunplay and movement feel fluid, with improved weapon handling and traversal mechanics. However, balance problems, inconsistent weapon tuning, and erratic hit registration plagued the launch. The map design, while visually impressive, often felt too large and empty, leading to disorganized gameplay and long travel times between engagements.

Graphically, Battlefield 2042 demonstrates the full capability of the Frostbite engine. Massive storms, tornados, and destructible environments create dramatic visual moments. Weather systems and map-changing events deliver spectacle but sometimes interfere with gameplay clarity. Sound design and atmosphere remain strong, maintaining the immersive audio identity of the franchise.

At release, the game lacked a single-player campaign, focusing entirely on multiplayer modes: All-Out Warfare, Hazard Zone, and Portal. All-Out Warfare provides the classic large-scale experience; Hazard Zone blends extraction-style mechanics with tactical objectives; and Portal allows players to create custom matches using assets from Battlefield 1942, Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. Portal became a highlight due to its flexibility and nostalgia value.

Performance and stability were major concerns early on, with bugs, UI issues, and server instability dominating launch feedback. Over time, DICE released extensive patches that improved optimization, restored classic class structures, and overhauled maps to increase combat density. The post-launch updates gradually transformed the game into a more stable and coherent experience.

In summary, Battlefield 2042 began as an ambitious but uneven experiment that traded structure for scale. While its launch was rough, consistent updates have made it more enjoyable and closer to the series’ roots. It remains visually stunning and technically impressive, but its design choices divided fans. For players seeking large, chaotic, modern battles with evolving support, it has matured into a solid—if unconventional—entry in the Battlefield series.",1762757625,253.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4761904776096343

Well worth a buy on sale if you like tinkering with game modes.
I like the Portal experience where i can make my own game and rules.
Like WW2 US soldiers versus Modern RU for example.
Another cool feature is projectile speed that can be changed ,so a bullet flys at half speed.
I also like to tweak soldier health and vehicle health too.
I think the default vehicle health is too high -
realistically a couple of Rpgs should take out a vehicle - so I reduce this health value.
You can make the game 2 shot kills if you want for infantry ,maybe 1 for snipers and shotgun slugs.


Runs OK on older laptop -just limit fps to 57fps and play at 720p ,this will reduce CPU heat a lot. In a similar vein i made a User.cfg to use only 2/3rds of my cpu cores and threads -this also reduces CPU heat.
The only problem I think without doing these 2 things is the high CPU heat when playing game.

1517290,True,"BF2042: The Underrated Titan of the Battlefield Franchise

Honestly, BF2042 has evolved into something special — F2042 delivers some of the best core gameplay the series has ever seen.
Best movement, best weapon handling, best vehicle handling, great spotting, and great maps — alone, those five points make it a dream to play for anyone who values the classic Battlefield feeling refined to perfection.

Add to that better weapon customization and modification, maps spanning nearly every Battlefield era, vault weapons and vehicles, and the freedom to jump into ANY (classic) gamemode — all while enjoying constant events, a ton of easter eggs, and hidden secrets scattered throughout. It’s the most content-rich and flexible Battlefield to date.

Most importantly, it’s now a complete, fully functional, non-buggy, premium FPS — and you can grab it for just a couple of bucks. That’s insane value for what you’re getting.

After experiencing how polished and satisfying BF2042 has become, it’ll be a long while before I feel like dishing out cash for an overpriced, monetized BF6.

1517290,True,"A lot of people told me that Battlefield 2042 was trash when it first came out, but I decided to make my own opinion instead of just listening to others. And honestly, I’m glad I did.

At launch, the game definitely had problems — tons of bugs, missing features, and it didn’t really feel like the old Battlefield everyone loved. But after all the updates, it’s a completely different game now. The gunplay feels great, the maps are way better, and the new specialists system actually makes sense once you get used to it.

The large-scale battles with 128 players are insane in a good way. When everything explodes around you, helicopters flying over, tanks rolling in — that classic Battlefield chaos is back. The graphics and sound design are also top-notch, as always.

Of course, it’s not perfect. Some maps still feel too big or empty, and matchmaking can be a bit slow. But overall, it’s way better than what people say. I think most of the hate came from the early days, and people just never gave it another chance.

1517290,True,"BF2042 had a poor launch, coupled with bugs and unpolished maps. This more or less doomed it commercially because the internet has swift, brutal reactions and rarely deviates from initial judgments. 

Fast forward a couple years, and this game is polished, smooth, and extremely fun. I would argue the internet slept on this game, because it has been the best shooter on the market for several years, with great gunplay, squad gameplay, and a variety of maps and vehicles. The movement is fast-paced and quick, which makes gunfights extremely chaotic at times; the movement style is reminiscent of Titanfall or Apex Legends. I think this game gets a lot of undue hate because it dared to be different than other Battlefield games. It is less realistic and allows itself to be a little more silly than other Battlefield entries, but that quirkiness adds a much needed element of joy and fun to the game (the entire ""story"" with the no pats is frankly amazing in a silly, 1980s action movie kind of way). The reality is that most of the criticisms levied against it by the ""hardcore"" or ""older generation"" Battlefield fans are illegitimate when you break them down (or think critically for more than 0.2 seconds). E.g., 2042 gets a lot of hate for being ""less realistic"" than other Battlefield entries, but no one making this criticism actually wants realism, they [i]want[/i] to have a reason to hate this game. 

If you have a chance to pick it up on sale--which should be easy these days--consider giving it a shot. If you like modern games or movement shooters, you will probably enjoy this. Possibly more than BF6; considering BF6--at time of writing--feels and plays like a game from 20 years ago while BF2042 is more modern.

Wish they'd bring back Conquest 64, I'd probably still play this game.

1517290,True,"After putting almost 100 hours into Battlefield 2042, I’ve spent most of my time in the Engineer role — repairing vehicles, holding objectives, and keeping the team moving under fire. There’s something satisfying about being the backbone of a squad, making sure our armor stays operational while dishing out damage with launchers and gadgets.

I’ve also leaned into being a taker — pushing aggressively to capture points, secure vehicles, and turn the tide of fights. Whether it’s locking down a sector solo or coordinating with teammates, those moments of chaos and control make the game rewarding.

On top of that, I’ve logged plenty of time in the skies as a pilot. Mastering helicopters and jets has been a huge learning curve, but flying support runs, evading missiles, and delivering precise strikes feels incredible when it all comes together.

Altogether, the experience has been a mix of teamwork, skill, and sheer adrenaline — and even after 100 hours, Battlefield 2042 still finds ways to surprise me.",1760823531,5670.0,True,True,False,1,1,0.52173912525177

What's wrong with this game:

-The maps are so goddamn horrendous 64 player Conquest is essentially unplayable

-128 player Conquest is straight up just unplayable because the servers piss and shit themselves so hard that everything teleports at all times

-Vehicles are hilariously overpowered. The TRANSPORT Helicopter got re-classified as an attack helicopter because it has 4!!!!!!!!!!!! gunner seats on it?????? And essentially every other transport vehicle also has 4 gunner seats, making the transport vehicles the strongest attack vehicles for some godforsaken reason.

-Portal is dead and purely afk xp farms

-The extraction shooter gamemode thing is entirely dead so no clue if that's worth anything because you just cannot find a match

-Seriously the maps are so bad in so many different ways it's hard to even describe the ways they fail

-It's *alright* if you only plan on playing breakthrough but even then, with how overpowered vehicles are and only attackers getting them every single round will be an attacker stomp unless you play on one of the maps without vehicles.

-No ability to exclude certain maps from matchmaking

-The spawning system is amazingly bad, putting you in no-man's land 50 kilometers away from any objective with no cover literally anywhere so good luck!

I've enjoyed Battlefield 2042 but it wasn't as great as others such as Battlefield 3, 4 and 1. The gunplay felt a bit too quick, feeling more like a Call Of Duty then the average battlefield experience. The game is overall fun though and I did enjoy some of its weapons feeling absolutely broken to play with once you put the right attachements. 

To me, some of the most fun games I had were with the 128 players conquests games. Even if it felt like you were dying on repeat and couldn't solo flank an objective, the pure chaos of it was really fun! Def hoping some gamemode of it can be available on BF6's Portal mode.

Now one of the things I disliked in this game was the Hazard Zone gamemode. Ngl, it felt like a pathetic attempt at an Extraction Shooter. The gamemode isn't dead-dead but there is a really small community, so when you'll play it you might always be playing with the same people in your lobbies. It also felt dull with the goal of getting devices and them being really easy to get (only stacking up to 5, could have been better if you could get unlimited from looting people).

1517290,False,"I honestly didn’t think it was possible to make a Battlefield this bad.

When the game first dropped, I skipped it. I came back to it later, already having played almost every BF (except Hardline, and I barely touched BF1). And man… after BF5 and the open beta of BF6, this one - Battlefield 2042 - just feels awful.

And I’m not even talking about graphics or visuals - no, that’s fine. The gameplay itself is just straight-up terrible.

Yeah, there are massive 100-player modes, but the maps are so stretched out and empty that you spend forever running in silence with nothing happening. They’re so wide open that most capture points are completely dead - zero action, zero fun.

Weapon and vehicle balance is a joke. Gunplay has no feeling at all - every weapon feels like a laser gun, no recoil, no weight, nothing satisfying about it.

Vehicles? Same deal - total letdown. I love rolling in tanks, and in BF5, when you and your buddy roll up to a point, you feel that power - the tank feels heavy, impactful, dangerous.
Here? You’re just a slightly tougher SUV. Everyone can shred you, and the physics... it’s like driving on melted butter. No weight, no detail, no realism at all.

And what they did with classes and specialists - absolute cringe. Classes should be fixed. Assault has its weapons, Support has theirs. When everyone can pick whatever, it turns into a total mess.

No story mode either. That short intro cutscene when you first launch the game - that’s it. They might as well not have bothered.

Honestly, I couldn’t even force myself to finish the battle pass for the BF6 skins - I uninstalled after 17 hours.

This game is a total disappointment. You can tell by how the community reacted - everyone just went back to older titles. For a while, BF1 from 2016 even became the most played again.
Then after BF6 came out, 2042’s player count completely died again.

Sure, Battlefield games usually launch broken - that’s nothing new. But after a few months, they get fixed, and people end up loving them. Not this time though. Four years later, Battlefield 2042 is still one of the worst games in the series - and rightfully so.
The community sent a clear message to EA: rush jobs don’t fly anymore. They somehow managed to screw up even worse than BF5’s launch.

Rating for BF 2042 - 4.5/10

Let me add this - when the action actually does happen, it’s pure chaos.
If you were hoping for some hardcore mayhem in the middle of explosions and gunfire - yeah, that’s exactly what it is.
But it’s not the good kind. It’s like watching a Brazzers scene - intense banging, but zero emotion or feeling behind it. Just noise and chaos.

1517290,False,"[h1]Battlefield 2042: Scale but no Substance.[/h1]
‎ 
[i]2042[/i] is a game that they wanted to be a long lasting title in the franchise with the main focus being multiplayer which was made apparent in the marketing but what we got was a striped back almost beta-like game, especially on release. 
Years of updates have dragged the game into a serviceable state, but by the time things improved it was already to late, the damage was done. On top of that, microtransactions and a heavy emphasis on cosmetic skins and collaborations felt out of place and only added to the sense that the game prioritized monetization instead of the community.
I believe that disdain for the game in general was necessary for the franchise to improve, which is hopefully what we are seeing with Battlefield 6.
‎ ‎ ‎ 
[b]Price Paid:[/b] [i]A$ 139.95.[/i]

[b]Achievements: [/b][i]Most come as you play, though some are extremely grindy. Portal can speed things up, but the hardest ones are probably in Hazard Zone, good luck finding a match.[/i]


[h1]Recommendation:[/h1]With [i]Battlefield 6[/i], there’s very little reason to pick up [i]2042[/i] at this point. And even then, previous entries in the series still have active player bases and arguably offer better experiences.

[hr][/hr]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3582079857
[h2]Story.[/h2]
‎ 
A sequel to [i]Battlefield 4[/i], set 22 years in a climate-ravaged future, you play as the “No-Pats” — mercenaries hired by global superpowers to fight their wars. The premise had potential through gameplay with environmental collapse and destruction shaping the maps, but the game barely does anything with it. There is no single-player campaign which is a real disappointment as the single player was something I enjoyed a lot when I was younger. All the lore and worldbuilding that exists is scattered through the official website, community wiki, and what people have pieced together and shared on reddit. The game itself tells you almost nothing, except for what you may be able to surmise from trailers and maps. 
The writing for the Specialists, or No-Pats, is some of the most awkward and forced I’ve heard. The lines feel like they belong in a hero-shooter rather than coming from soldiers in the middle of a war, and yet even with all the quotes and their design they lack any actual personality. 

[h2]Gameplay.[/h2]
‎‎ 
The ambition with [i]2042[/i] was clear, but the execution leaves the core gameplay feeling stretched thin. Even with 128-player battles, maps can feel enormous and empty, where you can end up running for some time with little happening only to get gunned down by a jet or sniped by a tank which is especially bad when you are primarily an infantry player. Majority of the time, at least in OCE, full 128-player lobbies are uncommon, and most matches are filled with bots and the classic 64 player matches being the most popular, for good reason. 

Tornadoes and storms rip through maps in [i]2042[/i], which is impressive and exciting the first time you see them, maybe even the next few times. But the novelty quickly wears off, and they become more of an annoyance than anything disrupting your HUD, interfering with electronics, and tossing you around. 

The introduction of Specialists felt like a step backwards. Instead of creating more freedom and flexibility with loadouts, they ended up reducing team play. Even after the reintroduction of a semi-class system, individual character gadgets still felt like the main focus rather than team roles. While weapon access was opened up, DICE tried to justify class-specific weapons through small proficiency bonuses, for example, Assault players getting three extra magazines. However, this did very little.

Portal mode is easily the best feature to come out of[i] 2042[/i], offering a sandbox where players can build and share custom game modes using content from past [i]Battlefield[/i] titles. While it’s not something I personally spent much time with, there’s a featured game mode that rotates weekly on the home screen, often created by community members or even YouTubers and streamers. The mode also includes a server browser, allowing you to find and join populated lobbies, though usually with reduced XP gains.

Hazard Zone is an attempt at a ‘high-stakes’ squad-based extraction mode, [b]often compared to Tarkov[/b] — though it’s not on the same page let alone in the same book. You and three squadmates are dropped into an OG [i]2042[/i] map against multiple enemy teams, tasked with collecting data drives while fighting AI and other players. After gathering enough drives, you have two chances to extract via VTOL, which almost always turns into a fight over the extraction points. Very few people play this mode because it doesn’t offer much, and even when you do find players, it’s common to encounter campers that purely just sit at extract points. It’s an exhausting experience, and to complete achievements, I had to use a VPN just to find eight players for a single match.
‎‎ 
[h2]Difficulty.[/h2]
‎‎ 
Since [i]Battlefield 2042[/i] is primarily multiplayer, the challenge in PvP matches depends almost entirely on your skill and who you get matched with. The game also offers AI bot modes, which range from just shooting sitting targets to surprisingly tough opponents who are better than most players. Or, if you prefer, you can just sit in a tank an entire match like a Jackass.
‎‎ 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3582080556
[h2]Visuals.[/h2]
‎‎ 
Visually, the textures, models, and effects in [i]2042[/i] are all solid.[b] The problem is the art direction[/b], everything looks too clean and sterile, lacking personality or distinctive detail, which makes the game look worse than it actually is. They did attempt to rectify this over time by adding more debris around the maps but it did very little to improve the overall bland style. That said, some of the map releases later on were better designed and offered genuinely solid experiences.
‎ 
[h2]Audio.[/h2]
‎‎ 
Audio is a downgrade across the board compared to previous entries. While it has improved since release, the overall range still feels limited, certain sound effects come across as compressed, and directional audio is unreliable. Footsteps are often difficult to track or simply fail to play entirely, tanks can sometimes just sneak up on you with little warning. 
[b]The soundtrack is equally forgettable[/b]. It lacks identity and comes across as generally generic. While it may fit the game’s theme, it fails to stand out or add any real emotion to the gameplay, unlike, dare I say, the previous titles.
‎ 
[h2]Performance and Bugs.[/h2]
‎ 
I’ve seen a lot of complaints about poor performance, but [b]honestly my experience has been the opposite[/b]. The game runs smoothly, stable frame rates even in 128-player matches, and no stuttering or crashes on my end. I still ran into the occasional bug however, even after years of patches. Being disconnected from the server randomly, my character just floating next to the vehicle and broken animations when downed.

1517290,True,"I’ve been in the U.S. Navy long enough to know when the tide’s about to turn—and brother, Battlefield 2042 isn’t just a game anymore. It’s a prelude. A simulation of the chaos I can feel building in my bones. Every round I play is one step closer to the inevitable headline: “World War III Begins — Gamer Was Ready.”

When I boot up 2042, I’m no longer in my barracks. I’m deployed to a near-future hellscape where drones scream overhead and the air tastes like copper and adrenaline. I’m in the zone. My pulse syncs with the gunfire. My brain’s rewired to the rhythm of war. I can practically hear the reactor humming in the distance as I mutter, “God help the first Ivan who crosses my crosshair.”

The devs probably didn’t intend for this to be psychological warfare training, but here I am, a sailor stationed halfway across the Pacific, using every match to sharpen my instincts. When the bullets start flying, I’ll already have 400 hours of combat experience—sure, it’s digital, but so are most modern targeting systems.

The game’s chaos feels real. Jets screaming through the smog, hovercrafts drifting across skyscrapers, medics reviving me like I owe them back pay—it’s beautiful carnage. It’s the kind of environment that forges warriors or breaks them. My squadmates may be 13-year-olds yelling “EZ” into their mics, but in my head, they’re comrades in arms—brothers and sisters of the digital front.

Sometimes when I’m on watch duty, I’ll catch a reflection in the glass and see that 2042 thousand-yard stare. My CO asked me once what I was thinking about. I told him the truth:

“Sir… I was thinking about flanking the Russians on Kaleidoscope.”

Battlefield 2042 isn’t perfect—yeah, it’s got bugs, lag, and the occasional tornado that eats your GPU alive—but perfection doesn’t prepare you for the apocalypse. War isn’t pretty. It’s messy. It’s unstable. It’s Battlefield.

It was rough: you play not because you want to, or because you enjoy it, but because you have to. There was zero fun in that. And on top of that it’s still BF 2042. Sure, it’s not the same game it was at launch. They’ve patched it up a bit, and now, in my opinion, it’s in a slightly above-average state.

This last event is like the final point of Battlefield 2042, its last performance on stage before leaving forever.
And yeah, it was tough, but I wouldn’t say it was completely awful. Yes, the game is still rough the recoil feels awkward, the guns feel like plastic toys, and shooting is pure RNG, with terrible hit registration. As for optimization, I can’t complain. I’ve got a powerful PC, so no issues there.

One big plus: lots of new players joined during the event, and matches were found instantly.
Also, some maps with weather effects were genuinely cool. Yeah, that was supposed to be the feature of this Battlefield, but now I finally get it, when a tarnado starts and you're right in the middle, it's awesome. The new Iwo Jima map is fun, and I finally managed to properly play Hazard Zone. Course, I was already tired of it, but I couldn't help but be happy after five wins in a row or successfully exiting 25 times it wasn't easy. This game is way better with friends — you’ll get far more enjoyment than playing solo. Although, to be honest, I doubt many will play it.
At least the game looks good on ultra settings.
It’s not Battlefield 1 with its stunning visuals, but if you don’t compare them directly, BF2042 actually looks fine.

In the last two weeks, I’ve played around 80–90 hours, while before that I only had about 14–15.
Now I’m sitting at roughly 150 hours.
And yeah, for some reason I decided to unlock every single achievement… Don’t ask me why.

Originally, I planned to write this review after finishing the Battle Pass, but if I had done it back then, it would’ve looked like this: “This is absolutely terrible. I’m never coming back”

But I decided to play for my own enjoyment, and I actually found some positive sides not many, but still.

Will I return to Battlefield 2042? Definitely not.
And honestly, I’m pretty sure the player count will drop even lower tomorrow — October 10 — when Battlefield 6 releases.
The game got its last chance: many people tried it for the first time thanks to the 95% discount — it was just $3, €3, or 30 kr.
Some old players even came back, and that was great because the servers were filled with life. Many were sitting on PORTAL maps farming XP.

But the event is over and the game is slowly dying and it will continue like this.
Anyone who played during the last Battlefild 2042event winessed a unique event the last flare of a dying star before it faded away forever. Battlefield 2042 is not the best entry in the series.

There are still a lot of problems that remain. But it had one last chance a chance for players to enjoy it, at least a bit, before it becomes a completely dead game.

Personally, I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. Too bad Steam doesn’t have a 50/50 rating, because that’s exactly what this game deserves.

In the end: Battlefield 2042 isn’t a great game.
It has its flaws, but I still managed to have some fun with it.",1760033935,7470.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1517290,True,"It's a game. Not a Battlefield game but it is certainly a game that feels like it's inspired by it's predecessors. It's trying to be a million things at once while also trying to convince you it is just only one step up from BTF5. It works, it runs and the guns shoot, that's about all you can gather from it. 

The absence of a single-player takes away a massive core-identity of BTF games and you have no choice but to go head first into multiplayer PVP. If you have come from any of the previous games this will feel nothing like them and will likely bore you very rapidly if you are a stickler for the core tenets of the series. 

If you're reading this after the release of Battlefield 6, don't even waste your time downloading this game unless it's free. This game will forever be remembered as the game that wanted to be so much more but just ended up being known as a place-holder game for impatient players waiting for BTF6 to release and nothing else to do. 

I would say it was fun while it lasted but if I'm being objectively open about the game, you would have more fun and memorable times in BTF4 player hosted servers than anything portal could possibly offer. Save your time and money, this will likely never be a game any significant amount of players return to at any point in time, especially when compared to the longevity of BTF4, 1 and 5.",1760010772,10205.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

But this one, Battlefield 2042, honestly… I played the beta, and it was terrible. I played for a month of EA’s subscription just to try it, and when the trial ended, I didn’t renew it because it simply wasn’t worth it. The game was incomplete at launch, the maps were bad, and there’s really not much to praise about it.

Some people might like it, but as someone who’s played all the Battlefield games, there’s nothing here that stands out in a good way. I’ve got around 250 hours in it only because I bought it on sale for about 4 bucks, and I was grinding BF6 skins in Portal servers while AFK. That’s the truth.

1517290,True,"Well that was it Battlefield 2042. A game that started and ended with mixed emotions.
But believe it or not, as a big Battlefield fan, I gonna defend this title until the end, also because I felt some of the criticism unjustified. Why? Well you gonna find it out:

I played this game since the Beta and played almost every Season, so I have a very large opinion about this game. It’s so large that my review gonna be in bullet points to not make it too long.


Positive:
-Battlefield 2042 from all, the best conquest mode. Now it‘s almost impossible to capture one objective just by yourself in a 64 vs. 64 match. So I totally disagree that teamplay got worse, it got better. Good luck defending an objective by yourself when a transport vehicle comes to you.
-Due to the large scale maps, you are now just a small soldier on a big battlefield. That means in conquest you try control more an area of the map than the whole battlefield. This type of gameplay I could only experience on hardcore shooters like Hell Let Loose or Squad. But Battlefield 2042 proved you can get this great experience also on a casual shooter.
-The big maps are awesome with their diverse areas to play. I played them sooo much and still I haven’t seen enough. There are just so many places to explore. The other good thing of these map is, that they give freedom for every playstyle. For example in the old Hourglass map, you had so many possibilities. If you wanted to snipe, then go to the roof of the skyscrapers. If you want more of CQC like in Operation Metro, then go to the stadium.
-The plus system is awesome. Now you can modify your gun on the run if your combat situation changed. So no force to change your loadout on the menu anymore.
-The guns are balanced very well. Each category fulfils it’s purpose. Also Shotguns can finally be used outside of close combat thanks to the increased range. It‘s not the fault of the long area anymore, it depends of your tactic.
-Although I can agree that it sucks that we have specialist instead of classes, their gadgets like the wingsuit or ballistic shield, are just too much fun to dislike them.
-Even if you want to travel a long area of the map, you either pick a vehicle nearby or call a vehicle via your tablet. I never understood those people who complained that they needed to run minutes just to get to another objective. I always needed less than one minute moving on another objective. Even the tornado can be also used as a quick transport which looks cool at the same time.
-As an Battlefield 4 enjoyer myself, I can finally go another route against those elevator campers.
-Battlefield Portal is great.
-Almost all matches had a good team balance.
-The most most most important one: With my +750 hours playtime I witnessed maybe two or three cheaters, unlike Battlefield 5, where it was an every day situation.


Negative:
-Back in the day you felt, and sometimes still feel the problematic development for BF2042. On launch, the bugs really made Battlefield 2042 look unfinished and when they started to fix and update it, some new problems arrived and it got even worse. Now it is in a way better version, but it still feels a little bit unpolished like trying to redeploy when two squad members are close by or that Casper can‘t deploy a drone in a smoke because of whatever reason.
-I agree that the specialist having names and identities damaged effect to let the soldiers blend into battle. Now it gets more obvious that the same character models appear over and over again.
-No “Assist count as a kill” anymore.
-You also feel BF2042 identity crisis. Some map reworks and especially everything after Season 4 was like EA Dice saying: „Hey players, yes Battlefield 2042 is total garbage! And because of that we gonna remove those features that made this game special or change them to more normal mechanics!“. C‘mon we can all agree that BF2042 did not completed all their expectations but still it had new cool and fun things. Yes some people wanted a more classical BF experience but they would hate the new mechanics anyway.
-One thing that no one really talked about: Battlefield 2042 doesn‘t feel like a worthy next step after Battlefield 5. Many changes that were good in the previous title, didn‘t returned and it sucks. The ping spot instead of a 3D spot was great and way less annoying.

Those were all my points I have in mind.

TL;DR : Yes Battlefield 2042 had a rough start and yes BF2042 is not that polished like the other entries, but I liked this game… hell I love Battlefield 2042! From all games I played since Battlefield 4, this the Battlefield with my most playtime. Yes, and it‘s because the most ""battlefieldest"" game of all. If Battlefield for you means large scale combat, then Battlefield 2042 did and focused on exactly that. Great game, totally recommend it!",1759838593,46016.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1517290,False,"I did want to rate this positively, because it's honestly not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. But over these last few weeks leading up to BF6, I've had terrible crashes, in one specific spot. When you load into the main menu, your character spawns in and does a cool badass turn and walk towards the camera. Wow, so fucking cool and sick. Except... if you're like me, your game will crash as soon as they start walking to the camera. This isn't just an issue of it crashing when you load in--when you finish a match, you get a screen that shows you all of your unlocks from the last match. When you click through that menu and return to the main menu, your game crashes as your character walks at the camera. Doesn't matter how long you're in that initial rewards menu; you crash when the character model loads in. Awesome.

To make matters worse, this game relies on the tumor that is the EA desktop client. For NO fucking reason. And sometimes, the EA desktop client will simply refuse to connect to their servers, even though you're able to connect online with LITERALLY EVERY OTHER APP on your computer, even as you're in Discord VC with other people in the SAME STATE who are connecting to the EA servers no problem. Reset the EA app? Clear the EA app cache? Restart your PC? Uninstall the EA app and reinstall? Verify integrity of game files? UNINSTALL THE ENTIRE GAME AND REINSTALL IT? NOTHING WORKS. What does get it working again? Re-launching it for the 100th time, having changed NOTHING AT ALL, after trying to get in the game that you PAID MONEY FOR for 30 minutes... I'm not exaggerating when I say that the EA app may be the absolute worst piece of trash software I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, and I used to play League of Legends.

If Battlefield 6 requires you to launch through the EA app, I legitimately may request a refund. It is so shit.

This game's gameplay is fine. The maps are bland and insanely open. The time-to-kill of the gunplay is way too fast, guns are way too accurate at long range with full-auto fire, and helicopters are OP, frequently unkillable.

1517290,False,"Team Deathmatch stands out as one of the most enjoyable modes in Battlefield 2042 because it keeps the action focused and intense. The smaller-scale combat helps mask the game’s biggest weakness, which is its large, often poorly designed maps.

Unfortunately, the squad-based system limits coordination in larger public matches. With squads capped at four players, organizing as a single, cohesive team is nearly impossible. This restriction takes away the large-scale teamwork that Battlefield has always been known for.

As a group of ten friends, we can’t all join the same match like we could in past Battlefield titles. Unless we use custom Portal servers, we’re forced to split up, which really hurts the experience. Sadly, it seems this design direction may continue into Battlefield 6, which is disappointing for fans who miss the franchise’s classic large-squad coordination.

1517290,False,"This game is a tried-and-true aim down the sights FPS. And its the battlefield format. I personally had a lot of fun in this game as someone with above average FPS skill, who was trying to both aim train and also warm myself up for the battlefield format in preperation for the new game. 

The battlefield format is not something I am the most experienced in; I put around 250 hours into Battlefield 1 over the course of that games lifespan and it was really good! There was a lot of variety and the class system made sense. That game had its own host of issues with EA's notoriously bad publishing and arthouse descisions when it comes to monitization. Overall, it had some great and bad maps, along with great and bad guns. Vehicles were kickass and it felt like there was a ton to do.

Battlefield 2042 is the 2022 installment of the battlefield franchise - the modern adaptation of the battlefield format. This game still boasts a full $60 pricetag, for a really lackluster overall game experience. I put in the majority of my hours into this game in 2025, after all 7 seasons worth of content for BF2042. I had lots of fun farming clueless players with some of the most overpowered weapons I've ever used in any online FPS. The AM40 outclasses basically every other AR and SMG in class, The Rorsch-mk4 is a hitscan, no drop-off railgun weapon which makes snipers and sightlines basically irrelevant, from any distance, which is still mind blowing to revisit. There was offline modes where you can earn XP and custom made AFK XP lobbies for people who don't want to play this game. The maps were shitty and there wasn't a lot of them. I would rather gouge my eyes out with a shard of hard plastic than play one round of Conquest on any of them. Breakthrough was a ton of fun because every map is a gradual hill where overwhelming force can only be done from the top of said hill. At least there is plenty of combo kills to get, attachments to grind out, calling cards to achieve, and any arrangement of situations you can put yourself in with no class weapon restrictions and the limited combo of vehicles and aircrafts available on some maps.

This game is rated at 48% overall reviews. If this game were free, I'd say that is completely disagreeable. For what you get though, the only things that kept me playing this game were its kind of strange weapon unlock system, the extremely overly long battle pass, and the brief potent hits of dopamine I get from frying an entire platoon of people in one of the very poorly designed chokepoints. I dunno. It's mid. But it's kind of good. Its good mids. Avoid this if you are replaying the entire battlefield franchise. If you were stuck on an island, and you had this game, it wouldn't be the worst. As a modern multiplayer experience this is another disappointment in a line of them.

And I got some great unlocks for one or two seasons. But it were the seasons of bugs and broken sepcialists. So I had some fun in the beginning but it went down quickly. 

I hate the FOMO Battle Pass! 
I have like 10h per week to play. Enough to progress through the weekly missions to get the unlocks I want or even need. But I don't want to spend my preciuos time playing a game in a way I don't even want to play it. There are other games I want to play also, so curse you FOMO mechanics! 
But important specialist and vehicle unlocks need you to complete some BS tedious weekly missions just to get some points because grinding these points with regular gameplay takes forever. 

Yes you had the chance afterwards to unlock them with some missions like in BF3 but I never understood when they released because I was long gone and there were even weekly missions you couldn't complete because you hadn't unlocked the weapons in the battle pass before.

I liked the BF3 system better. Yes you had to grind through some objectives that were tedious but you could do it whenever you felt like it and after that you had your unlock. 
I played the BF6 beta, had fun and have high hopes so I tried BF2042 again for 3,99 to get the unlocks for BF6 and get some BF Fun. But nope. It will forever be the worst.

Will I buy BF6? Yes because I am sure I will get at least 100hs of fun out of it if it is equal to the beta and that is enough for me.

1517290,False,"After 95 Hours, It's Time for a Review

The game is now in a state it should have been at release.
It needs some work and balancing nothing major, but sadly it's at the end of its supported time

Maps:

Many maps need some work done, nothing major, but adding things here and there. 

Some of the big maps that were reworked aren't enough; they just shrunk the map and added some extra crates and other stuff to hide behind. That's a good start, but not enough.

In the map rotation are some BF5 maps, which worked well in BF5, a game with fewer explosions and a mechanic to rebuild defenses. An airfield with lots of barracks is now, after 20% of the game, just an open field with a capture point but no defenses.

Balancing:

Weapon: weapons balancing is mostly fine; some are a bit OP, but nothing major. Only snipers need some bullet drop and suppressed status when under fire. 

Vehicles: Tanks and other cars some weeks ago vehicles were nearly unkillable and had an extreme amount of firepower; now they have an extreme amount of firepower and are made out of paper. When you are in a tank, you can easily kill 10 people, but when someone has a rocket launcher, you are dead.

Hacker:

Wallhacks: are not easy to prove because of all the spotting gadgets, but I'm often in situations where it's really strange how they know where people are, because in my team they often don't like to spot people, and they have need really good teammates that are helping them.

Aimbot: I've seen more than once people on my team aim and look at enemies behind walls or above them on the roof when they were not spotted.

Performance:
Grafik und PC: its good nothing bad here
Connection: mostly good

☢️‹‹ Gameplay ›› [10/10]
‎ ‎Battlefield 2042 has a good and smooth gameplay. Like all classic Battlefields, the Conquest and Breakout modes are very entertaining and have maintained their identity well. In addition, it has an interesting and somewhat mining mode called Hazard Zone, which is also entertaining in its own right. The variety of weapons is also good, but one of the negative points of this game is having different classes that take a while to get used to because previous versions of Battlefield only used four classes, which I think the old versions are better in this regard. But this cannot be considered too negative, but changing the structure of the game, which is popular for its simplicity and realism, is not very interesting.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Graphics ›› [8/10]
‎ ‎The graphics have always been beautiful in different versions of Battlefield and have always had a realistic atmosphere. In Battlefield 2042, they have also tried to maintain a realistic and logical environment in the future, and in this respect it has been good. However, having simple textures in some environments and having weak destructibility made this game less than expected. It must be said that one of the signatures of Battlefield is the destructibility of the environments and their effects on the gameplay, but unfortunately it performs poorly in this case. Of course, there are natural disasters in this game such as hailstorms and hurricanes, but these are not very interesting.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Sound & Music ›› [6/10]
‎ ‎The music in this game is not very interesting. Just a few sound effects that you hear from time to time, even one is not that impressive. If you listen to the music of Battlefield 3, 4 or 1, you will fully understand the weakness of this version of the game.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Story & Narrative ›› [0/10]
‎ ‎As a fan of the Battlefield franchise, I was really disappointed that this version didn't have a campaign or story mode.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ World and Atmosphere ›› [8/10]
‎ If I were to talk about the atmosphere of the game, it is really good and acceptable. The game environments are very well designed and large, and since the game is set in the future, we see logical and realistic structures (unlike Call of Duty). The game's weather is natural and the light colors of the environments are well preserved. I personally like the rainy and gloomy environments very much, which are well done in this case.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ AI & Challenge ›› [10/10]
‎ If you have played the custom modes or the portal mode (with AI), you will realize how good AI is in this game and it is kind of enjoyable because it gives the feeling of real players and performs exactly as you expect. Regarding the challenges of the game, I must say that it has challenging and completely fair challenges and completing them is quite enjoyable, whether to get cards or unlock attachments and guns or battle passes.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Performance & Technical ›› [8/10]
‎ The game has good performance and can be played with relatively old systems to some extent. But the game has some bugs that apparently have never been fixed and will never be fixed. For example, when playing, you will definitely encounter lag during animations or when structures are destroyed. Some of the game's animations have problems and of course there is also getting stuck somewhere on the map and sometimes it is really annoying. Most of the time, there is a problem with loading the game's textures and it takes a long time to load.
‎ 
☢️Battlefield 2042 is a good and fun game, but it has some differences from what you might think of as previous versions, and this may not be satisfactory for many.

The gun-play feels good, squad play can still deliver that classic Battlefield chaos and some of the updates genuinely improved the experience. It still has its flaws, like weak map design and questionable balance but if you go in with tempered expectations, there’s fun to be had. It’s not the Battlefield we wanted but it’s no longer the joke it started as.

1517290,False,"This game is almost good. It's infuriating, because most of the problems stem from the idiotic decision to design the entire game around Specialists and throw out the original class system back at launch. Why EA thought a hero shooter formula was a good fit for a game with 32 players per team is completely beyond me, but it feels like they wanted to prioritize the extraction royale Hazard Zone mode over the rest of the game at first, which flopped immediately so instead we were just left with the traditional Battlefield style scale balanced with a 4 player squad extraction royale in mind.

Granted, the game is in a far better state it launched in and a lot of the issues have been at least mitigated or addressed in some way, but there are still some serious problems. Gadget variety is pretty terrible since every specialists brings their own gadget to the first gadget slot, which isn't interchangeable at all. Want to run AT mines and a launcher? Too bad, you can only do that with Lis and have to deal with a super unmaneuverable TV guided missile launcher, the other two engineer specialists simply have turrets meant to counter infantry. A lot of the more powerful gadgets simply don't get used because the specialists they're tied to aren't fun to play or can't compete with the passives of another specialist.

Vehicle balance is pretty horrendous since the majority of conquest maps give both teams 2 Jets, 2 Attack helicopter, and a transport helicopter, and vehicle respawn is on a per player basis so you're just getting spammed by air for the entire match. Ground vehicles are oppressively mobile and omnipresent, and people don't seem particularly interested in coordinating AT launcher fire to counter them instead just preferring to run and gun against other infantry players, which was always a problem in BF but reached new heights with this game.

Player visibility across the board is pretty bad and oftentimes you'll just have to rely on looking for the orange dorito above people's heads to tell if someone's just being a bush wookie. And even if you do see someone, both teams use the exact same specialists and skins so you can't just tell at a glance what side someone is on without seeing their red lite-brites or seeing their red name above their head, which can be a problem. Which is funny because the infamous bots used to fill out servers have defined faction appearances and class designs which look a lot more interesting and cool than any of the basic default specialist skins. But apparently DICE thought we didn't want to play as soldiers, just zoomer mercenaries and old folks straight out of the retirement home.

Most guns are very low recoil and have very little spread so getting caught out by someone usually means very quick death even from a distance. Maps are far too open even after the passes made to tighten them up and add more cover, leaving you with classic Battlefield situations where sniper sightlines can just dominate the entire map and leave huge stretches of ground watched by vehicles that infantry just can't do anything about. Smaller scale modes like TDM and Rush suffer from poor map layouts that have the exact same issue of just too much open ground watched over by rooftops and long sightlines.

And then of course, no campaign. That's not a dealbreaker but you're undeniably just getting less content than other games that have some sort of singleplayer campaign on offer. All the lore is explained through calling cards (of all things) and a codex buried in the menu that nobody reads, and whatever voiceover both teams announcers give at the start of a match. And the story itself on display, what little there is, isn't very good. Blackburn is a eugenicist tech magnate obsessed with making cyborgs or something (????? how the fuck do you go from stopping New York being nuked to that?), the factions from 2142 are being established with the Mandate of Nations being the new EU after the old EU collapsed and lead to the No-Pats, and the Thousand Petals Coalition being the early incarnation of the PAC. The No-Pats themselves have basically formed Outer Heaven out of South Africa. It's just a mid story told in the worst way possible.

Le jeu s’est beaucoup amélioré depuis son lancement catastrophique. Les bugs sont largement corrigés, le gameplay est plus fluide, et le mode Portal permet des expériences très fun.

Les combats à grande échelle sont toujours aussi intenses, surtout avec les véhicules et les effets météo dynamiques.

MAIS : les cartes restent parfois trop grandes/vastes, le feeling des armes n'est pas au niveau des anciens BF pour certains, et le système de spécialistes peut diviser.

En promo, ça vaut le coup. Plein tarif ? À toi de voir selon ton niveau de tolérance aux défauts.

Gunplay still feels good but the sliding movement stuff is a little annoying to deal with given the current date of how most FPS games use movement mechanics.

The specialists are somewhat shoehorned in, I like the idea of having certain characters with special gear but it does get pretty dumb at times due to how certain maps are done. 

Not a bad battlefield game, worth the three Euro for when was on sale. Done the battlepass on time and it scratched my BF itch until BF6 drops soon.

1517290,True,"TLDR: Good game but isn't very realistic with it's skins and gameplay ideas, still good for 6 cad

This game is just okay.

It isn't too good nor bad, but it's just in the middle.

Before I start though, I wanna say that I'm actually fine with most of the stuff I'm going to talk about, since it won't really matter in real games. I just want to alert to the idea of what they were trying to and do and what they did do and how it kind of killed the games atmosphere and idea in general.

CAMPAIGN:
uhhhh
there isn't one

Multiplayer:
This is the only gamemode there is for 2042. That doesn't mean its bad just because its MP only, but anyways.
The guns are actually fine, there is a lot of attachments for different scenarios and combined with the quick attachment changing thing  you can use the same gun for a variety of different scenarios. Is it realistic? Not really, but it is helpful.
2042 also brings new modes like hazard zone which i haven't played but I assume its like EFT or MW22s DMZ. It also brings 128 player conquest, which is just conquest but with double the people. 
Probably my biggest issue with the game is the operators. What the FUCK were they thinking adding this. After having a perfect formula with BF3, 4, 1 and 5 they throw it out the window for some reason. It's not even like they were copying anyone significant since the popular games in 2021 were COD (MW19, BOCW, Vanguard) and fortnite, NEITHER having operators (that had different skills). If anyone, they copied BO3 and 4, but 3 was 2015 when they had 4 and hardline and 4 was around the BF1 and 5 era. 
Anyways, there's operators but to add salt to the wound you can use ANY gun on ANY class. Tbf this was the thing with every other game but at least they were shared weapons like SMGS and stuff, not any gun for anyone. The operators though I will admit are useful in their own ways, but I don't know about some grappling hook or wingsuit bullshit (I wish I was joking but these are deadass in the game), like this isn't Just Cause 3 (peak game btw buy it)

Then the skins, oh my lord the skins. They have:
COD type bullshit skins (at least not nicki manaj but whatever) 
Stupid looking gun skins
And just in general too much colors. 
I would much rather play an unknown soldier, not some celebrity operator with superpowers to not die. I would even accept the aforementioned weird gadgets if we could use them with their respective classes and without a specific operator. The operators don't even look cool or anything but they sound so fucking annoying.

With all of that said, this isn't a bad game. It's actually a pretty good game if you don't listen to the operators and don't cry about the gadgets like I did (I actually love the gadgets it just feels unrealistic). You can probably ignore the weird op skins too, but again it's just about the idea that they did this stuff.

So much so, I figured I wanted to check out something else before BF6 release. I found BF2042 having the largest active player base at the time. Got lucky, it was on Steam on sale. 
I love it, its fun, it's what doctor ordered. I like the specialisms, the gadgets, the combat approach, being able to use ground and air vehicles. Following the news in the analog world I became aware of valiant Bradleys, and St.Javelins few years ago already... having discovered it in a game was a treat! More importantly it got me back into the frenzy of CoD:MW2 -- endorphins.
I would have loved to see this game to be more realistic, more gory, with enemies laid waste on the battlefield uncleared.

1517290,False,"while there is a lot about this game that is quite terrible, it does offer a unique experience that we'll never get again in a battlefield game.

the maps are pretty afwull, especially the open maps with plenty of space for snipers to just use a sniper rifle with bullets that have no dropoff and kill you from 750 meters away, these large maps also facilitate many very powerful vehicles like the blackbird helicopter and many weapons platform tanks and surprisingly few ways to fight them if supported properly.

the heroes are a terrible idea, it creates such a powergap, some heroes are just far better then others because they can do more on their own, the girl with the wingsuit and rain grenade outshines all other assaults, the recon with the hacking thing is just straight up more useful then the anti-targeting/tracking or little scout bot that only works for your squad.
for medics the girl with the healing gun is rediculously better then all others, and for the engineers i think the bald black guy with the deployable minigun is the strongest.
as you can see i don't remember any of their names.

on the vehicles, there's too many at once on any given map, if anyone is  good at flying the helicopters there is just no way to be rid of them, AA rocket launchers are a joke because a lot of heli's have re-chargeable flares, there's no limit to how many times they can just recharge the ability, and if push comes to shove, fly low and avoid any and all rockets while still mowing down hundreds without risk, yes i'm very salty  about blackbirds coming up next to my ear and whispering how fucked i am as they proceed to pinpoint accuracy shoot me with rockets, i tried it myself but i'm not an alien so the controls didn't make sense to me. i'm sure the guys who are great at flying them are having a great time though.

despite all that i am having a decent time with it, i got the game for 3 bucks so i definitely got my money's worth and has soured my experience with battlefield to the point where battlefield 6 will feel like such an improvement i'll be over the moon when i get to touch that, at this point i can no longer recommend the game as a lack of singleplayer content deems this game completely absolete in a week.",1759131336,2795.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1517290,False,"This game is truly a mixed bag. Overall, I feel that the game is just flawed at a fundamental level.

First the good. The ability to customize your weapon while on the ground is awesome. Being able to change your weapon's attachments for close and far range engagements made the game more dynamic and fluid. Portal is a really great feature that they are expanding on in BF6. Being able to play my favorite BF3, BF4, and Bad Company 2 maps is just chief’s kiss. Lastly, and more personally, the easter eggs and love they gave the game with its final battlepass made me believe there are still some people who really care over at DICE despite all the crap we give them (and the crap they do to themselves in their work culture).

The bad, however, far outweighs the good. Gone are classes that have been a core to Battlefield, replaced by a range of characters that was merely made to fulfill a marketing diversity checkbox. Gone are weapons being exclusive to said classes, replaced with a half-assed class perk system that you’d hardly even notice is a thing. For some god-awful reason, they separated vehicle upgrades by faction and there are technically THREE of them: US, Russia, and personal. Gone is the destruction system to be replaced by 128 player matches which did not add to the experience whatsoever. 

Finally, XP farming for their battlepass is a fundamental issue. Why play assault at all when you can just play recon and rack up points with spotting assists? Why play engineer when you can run around reviving and giving people supplies as support? Why play at all when you can just join an AFK server and gain the points needed while you play other, more worthwhile games? This goes back to vehicle upgrades in that you must spend HOURS to upgrade your vehicles and that is just for one faction. If you want a SPECIFIC faction, you’re better off making your own portal server with rules that allow you to switch sides (thank God Dice allows you to do this for free).

So no, I do not recommend this game. BF6 will have many of the problems listed here delt with, but you can bet it’s not going to be a smooth ride and that is just part of the journey at this point.",1759111489,5242.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

If you managed to get it on sale for $3 like I did, it's a pretty fun time waster, but I would definitely still say this is the weakest Battlefield game. It is infinitely better than it was on launch but still not amazing. If they put it on sale for $3 again or similar price, I would definitely say it's worth the price of admission. Though, with 6 right around the corner, I wouldn't be surprised if the playerbase for this game tanks rapidly, as I imagine most people playing right now are either grinding out the BF6 battlepass unlocks or are similar to me, new players from the $3 sale.

Very Call Of Duty styled weapon handling and gunplay. Recoil is negligible on most guns compared to BF norms, snipers are insanely powerful and easy to use, and Carbines are missing entirely. Pistols feel like shit other than the Magnums. 

Operator abilities range from hilariously broken to nearly useless, and battles can swing very fast as a result of a single operator. Falck in particular can revive nearly instantly, heal herself like Assaults can, and revives at full HP regardless of defib charge, meaning that you can gun down an entire group of enemies and then watch them all get right back up fully ready within 10 seconds. Meanwhile Paik has a detection gadget that is worse than the T-UGS that any recon can equip and reveals her own position, alongside a passive ability that is basically useless.

Map design is questionable at best, with very weird sightlines and strangely cluttered areas mixed with nearly barren ones. A lot of individual objectives seem well designed but overall map layouts feel very off as a returning player.

Portal is really cool but not worth the price of entry and it can be hard to find servers populated with modes you would actually want to play. Most portal servers are either crazy one-shot-kill super hardcore servers where if you step out of cover for a second you get nailed from miles away, or are weird EXP grinding servers where you can't actually play the game. Maybe if this game hadn't been such a disaster on launch Portal would have taken off more?

A specialist system that nobody asked for, and was crammed in to fit a class system that is still horrible with obvious best in slot picks.
Weapon balancing that makes Hardline go weak at the knees.
Lore that might as well be from another game that is much better than this shit.
Worst of all, probably one of the most gut-wrenching renditions of the Battlefield theme, along with it's own exquisite selection of wet farts for music.

1517290,False,"SBMM is completely broken, the desync in this game is by far the worst I’ve ever experienced, and you're constantly matched with awful teammates while being forced to fight players who've been grinding since Day 1.

Seriously, the desync is so bad it makes me want to rip my hair out. The game shows a ping of 30ms almost all the time, yet I'm still getting killed while clearly behind cover.

Your team rarely plays the objective and is too scared to push 90% of the time. Solo queueing is unbearable. With the way health and gunplay works, unless you catch someone off-guard or you're in the top 1%, you’re likely not clutching anything.

For some reason, shotguns can kill you from 50 meters away. I've lost count of how many times I’ve started shooting someone with a marksman rifle, only to get one-tapped in the head by buckshot. It’s ridiculous. I’m so sick of FPS games turning shotguns into jack-of-all-trades weapons. COD is guilty of this too—arguably even worse. Shotguns shouldn’t dominate most gunfights. If I’m shooting someone at range, I should be able to outgun them. But right now, you can’t.

The enemies you fight are unbearable. It’s always a squad of snipers with 1,000+ hours, or someone in a helicopter with the same. It’s rare to find a match where you’re not sweating every second just to stay competitive.

This game is also missing so many core features from previous Battlefield titles. There is absolutely no reason I should have to requeue after every match. You grind for 10-20 minutes depending on the mode, and then you’re forced to sit in a queue again before starting all over.

Players don’t even play their roles properly. Snipers run around like they’re using assault rifles, and assault players are too scared to push past the first objective. Medics rarely heal or revive; your squad will watch you bleed out and run right past you like you don’t exist.

The map variety is pathetic. Maybe it’s because I don’t have the Ultimate Edition and there are DLC maps I’m missing, but after 20 hours, I feel like I’ve played the same five maps over and over. And yes, I know there’s more content in Portal—but I’m playing Battlefield 2042 to play 2042. If I wanted Battlefield 3, I’d just go play Battlefield 3.

Overall, this is by far the worst Battlefield game ever made. The HUD color scheme is ugly—it looks like a mobile game with all the bright light-blue highlights. The guns don’t feel right; it often feels like I'm firing non-lethal rounds. There are a million attachments for each gun, most of which offer little to no noticeable difference. There are like three different suppressors, compensators, and grips, and I can't tell them apart except for the visuals. Also, thermal scopes don’t work through smoke—which, correct me if I’m wrong, is the entire point of a thermal scope.

Thankfully, Battlefield 6 is on the horizon, and it looks like they’re finally learning from their mistakes. All we can do now is pray.",1758986067,1404.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1517290,False,"[h1] The Good, The Bad and The Worry for BF6 [h1]

BF2042 is a rough ride. At launch, it was miserable — constant disconnects, unbearable lag, and kills that felt like finding the Holy Grail. I walked away, especially when the game leaned into live-service trends like battle passes and seasonal grinds. Recently I gave it another shot during double XP weekends, hoping it had improved before BF6. It hasn’t. I still don’t enjoy it, and I’m worried that some of its worst elements might bleed into the next game.

[h2] The Good [h2]

Visuals & Maps: The maps are beautiful, even if some blend together.

Portal: A creative mode that allows for unique war sims and scenarios, often as engaging as full-priced titles.

Weapons: A large arsenal, letting you find a favorite (though balance issues make many weapons pointless).

Weather Effects: Tornadoes and sandstorms are gimmicky but fun, sometimes more enjoyable than the game itself.

[h2] The Bad [h2]

Map Design: Most maps are far too big, a sniper’s paradise. For AR and SMG players, it feels awful. Even at a 70 FOV, spotting enemies is a blurry mess.

Portal Abuse: Once a highlight, it’s now plagued with AFK grind lobbies and restricted XP, making it pointless.

Community: Toxic, camp-heavy, and more like COD than the Battlefield of old. Veterans dominate with “meta builds,” leaving newcomers frustrated.

Squad Play: Playing with friends is unreliable; one of you often gets kicked mid-match.

Music: Grating and out of place, distracting more than immersive.

 [h2] Why I’m Worried About BF6 [h2] 

Most fans already know the issues with specialists and progression, so I’ll focus elsewhere:

Customization: Battle passes make everyone look the same. Let players personalize their characters.

Map & Spawn Design: Both BF2042 and the BF6 beta suffer from poor spawn points and oversized, empty-feeling maps. “Big” doesn’t have to mean “vacant.” Give us large, but meaningful, maps with good flow and fewer cheap deaths.

BF2042 had potential but squandered it with poor design and live-service baggage. I can only hope BF6 learns from these mistakes.",1758977420,2476.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

1517290,True,"Battlefield 2042, like its predecessors, has always been a sandbox-like FPS. All the gadgets, vehicles, and their abilities allow each player to approach the battle in different ways with a lot of freedom and this is what, for me, separates the series from other FPS like CSGO or CoD. The modern vehicles add a lot of variety and chaos to matches and are quite well balanced, as they can influence the tide of battle without being too OP or having too much health. A tank without infantry escort, just like in real life, won’t last long.

Players move really fast, opening up many tactical opportunities, but there are drawbacks. By making the pacing so fast, you get that adrenaline rush from the game, but it also means you may be attacked from any direction. This translates to a lot more deaths and what often feels like a meatgrinder; you spawn, rush to the point, die 15 seconds later, and start spamming the respawn button again. 
Also. some maps are also way too big, and both teams end up spreading everywhere, turning the entire play area into a no man’s land.

Unfortunately, the game practically removed environmental destruction except for a few large-scale events. That, at least for me, was a big selling point of the previous titles, not only is it fun to “blow things up,” but it also adds strategy by opening new paths or exposing camped enemies.

I instead really liked Portal and the custom server modes. With Portal, you can play with content from many older BF titles while also creating custom rules for your own matches. 
For example, you can invite a friend into your private lobby and play a co-op PvE match set in WWII with uniforms and vehicles from Battlefield V or even the Vietnam DLC from Bad Company 2. It’s not at the same level of a Halo forge but offers a lot of possibilities.

[h3]Conclusions[/h3]
The game was an incomplete, broken mess at launch, and many features like QoL and Portal were added later, making a lot of people (myself included) change their minds. That’s why I strongly advise not to be afraid of its bad online reputation and just give it a go, maybe with a friend, since it’s often on sale.

1517290,False,"This should be a ""mixed"" review, but steam doesn't have a mixed rating for individual reviews. 

Let me preface this by saying that I actually hate pvp shooters, and the only way I'd really play one is if a friend joined me on one. So maybe take what I say with a grain of salt, especially since i first played this long after the garbage launch this game had. What brought me to this game ironically enough was both the sale of it being for only 3 dollars, and watching gameplay videos of the BF6 beta and seeing how much people praised it, so i decided to pick this up. I've actually never played a BF game before so this is actually my first endeavor into this series. First impression of this game was weirdly good, for a 3 dollar game discounted from 60. Several hours later, the biggest problems with this game started sticking out like soar thumbs. The biggest one being, the god awful map design that makes it easy for someone to equip snipers and spawn kill everyone from the enemy team spawning in from a somewhat far but close location. The other big problem is the borderline nonexistent methods of countering the tanks and fighter jets, worsened by just how straight up OP they both are. The only counters are the anti tank mines that some of the tanks have, and the RPGs that the engineer class has, and even then it's not a guarantee to bring ether of them down with them, so it just leads to someone with a tank easily shreading a group from an enemy team to bits. Being constantly faced with those 2 problems in most matches simply lead to me deciding I've had enough of this game and decided to uninstall it and just not bother with the free battle pass. Which is such a shame because I actually liked the gameplay loop that mixes together co op and pvp togehter that this game (and other BFs) have. I put in 30 hours in total, so I did end up getting my 3 dollars worth of it, and that is probably all what this experience is worth, not 60. To end this off, this game did one good thing, which was entice me to want to try the older BF games the next time they go on sale.

I originally bought the game on PlayStation back in 2021. While I managed to put in around 70 hours and had some fun, it was impossible to ignore how disappointing it felt. For a franchise that’s so close to my heart, it was clear that the game lacked many of the qualities that made earlier entries shine.

Recently, I decided to reinstall it thanks to a discount and some unlocks for BF6. To my surprise, much has been improved, and I ended up sinking another 60 hours into it.

The game still feels a little soulless and generic at times, but there’s definitely fun to be had. One of my favorite aspects is the sense of scale that comes with 128 player Conquest. The addition of weekly missions pushes me to experiment with different weapons and tactics, which keeps things fresh. Text and voice chat have finally been added, and some genuinely great maps too. Plus, the cringey voice lines? Gone.

1517290,False,"Now that I've finally finished the free pass and unlocked all the skins for Battlefield 6, I can honestly say without a doubt that while the game is definitely better than when it first released...that's not by much.

Lets start with one of the worst aspects. The net code. You are guaranteed to get shot around corners constantly, shots will often go right through enemies (as if their hitbox is non-existent), or sometimes it feels like it takes an entire mag to kill one enemy. That works both ways though. Sometimes enemies put an entire mag in you and you shoot like 5 bullets and kill them instantly. The amount of times I've eliminated enemies who were around a corner already and no longer in my line of sight is CRAZY.

The operators are dumb, their powers are even dumber. The irony that this game takes place in 2042 and is for some reason far more futuristic than Battlefield 2142 that came out in 2006 but is somehow in the same universe makes ZERO sense. I feel like a good 80% of the abilities are just made to annoy you. Dozer's shield, Paik's wallhack, Boris's sentry, Crawford's deployable turret that has infinite ammo (but can overheat and cool down quick). Funniest operator's ability is Casper and his drone. Talk about untested. The drone's hitbox is massive for such a tiny drone. Its hilarious.

I think the only real fun I had in the game is the phantom easter eggs and playing with friends because they enjoy it and its quality time to spend with them. Playing this game alone is torture.

All of my playtime on this steaming pile of shit has been to unlock items for Battlefield 6, and it has honestly been a nightmare.
I purchased this game well over a year ago for $2.50 and played less than 1 hour at that time, only to realize that the game was complete shit. And that was back then. Guess what, nothing has changed.
This game is riddled with bugs, hit registration issues, and flawed mechanics that cause players to feel only frustration and grief. ""Hero"" style playable characters only retract from the typical Battlefield experience. Making unique characters has somehow had the opposite effect and makes everyone feel less important. Most of these characters have borderline useless abilities or they are only applied in very unique scenarios that require specific maps or conditions to be met before they are actually useful.
Battlefield is primarily a multiplayer experience, but without a campaign you are left with only a PvE bot-mode that gives reduced experience and no battlepass progression.
Maps are easily forgettable and lack any kind of interesting or unique features.
Nothing about this game is actually good.
After Battlefield 6 comes out, I think I will either hide this game or remove it entirely from my Steam library to hide my shame that I wasted so much time for such pointless cosmetics IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAME.

1517290,False,"TL;DR: Came for the BF6 battle pass, was given no reason to stay. 

Bought it once in '22, refunded it because terrible game. Fast forward to '25, Battlefield 6 beta was great, picked this back up on sale for the BF6 pass (cringe, I know, but I wanted cosmetics and it was on sale for $3. EA knew what they were doing). 

Objectively the worst Battlefield title, I have heard 5 was worse but I never played it so 2042 gets that title instead. I've been around this series since like '08 so I feel like I can judge it pretty well. 

This one is kind of fun and sort of okay here and there but it really just handles like one of those free to play FPS games that were all over the place in the late 2000's early 2010's. You might like that, it's not my thing, and it's not a Battlefield thing. It's like playing a knockoff of itself, kinda like BF:Play4Free except that was free. I could nitpick the problems like the lame gunplay, weak map design, busted spawn system, etc., but there are other reviews that do that a lot better.

I got my pass completed, EA got their cash grab and boosted player count to tell the suits their worst game did great, and they also got an honest review.

Rocket launchers need direct hits

Weapon attachments 
Take too long to unlock

Audio
Directional queues are jumbled and difficult to pinpoint where the enemy is

1517290,False,"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP.... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP... MISSLE INCOMING! DUMP FLARES, DODGE ""LIS""SILE, RINSE REPEAT.  

As a BF player since BC2, not only is this a disgrace to be called ""Battlefield"" but the overall experience is completely lackluster on all fronts. The lac of class lock is an abysmal decision by every aspect of Battlefield's core game play. Nothing feels rewarding because its either easily countered by cheese operator kit's or the game's optimization or lack of. The guns feel no different across the board, the full selection is nice to have if they didn't copy paste every single weapon with a re-skin of a past BF game, the selection is nice. 

Side note, I play BF to fly. With that being said, there is little to no chance of making any significant effort in a game with the selection of all operators in a single game being engineer. Most games, 75%-80% of the team are engineer and that's being generous. Couple that with the amount of AA weapon kits across foot and vehicles, it is borderline impossible to do anything worth while in a rotary wing aircraft. Not only that, the only way to make the aircraft worth anything is by leveling it up. So if you don't want to hop into an AI match to farm bots to level the kit up, you're stuck dumping flares, falling back to cover, rinse repeat without a chance to kill anything, because again, there is zero optimization for any of the weapon's. 

Terrible hit registration for both ground and vehicle weapons. The Apache (all weapon systems minus the gunner) are quite literally useless. Dumping 10 rockets on a single ground operator is overkill. I get that's why there is a gunner and IRL, that's how it is. But don't give the opportunity to also fly/shoot and it be like I'm knitting sweaters and tossing balls of yarn at them. The little bird is really the only rotary wing aircraft that has any value. 

I have never in my life wanted to suck start one of their marshmallow shooters so badly but because of the hit registration, I'm sure it'll rubber band into the ceiling.

Battlefield Portal was an amazing Idea that because of the game flopping meant we never got any extensions to it like BC 2 Vietnam being added or 4.

1517290,False,"I bought this solely for the BF6 rewards. It was on a 95% off sale, and I got an extra 10% off with my EA play subscription. Hence, I have very little invested in the game. 

Even so, I don't think it's very good. Whilst there is still some fun to be had, the sheer abundance of unacceptable core problems sap most of that enjoyment away.

[b]Gunplay[/b]

It's decent, for the most part. I have noticed plenty of instances of terrible hitreg however, particularly when hip firing. If the entirety of my crosshair is overlapping with the enemy player right in front of me, I should expect the majority of my shots to hit. I should not expect to see no hitmarkers and be killed by that enemy after a few seconds of shooting at him.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]

No persistent servers. You have to requeue after every game. This would be fine expect the matchmaking is fairly slow, sometimes taking 3 or 4 minutes to find a game. I also struggled to find matches for close quarters conquest, and I have yet to find a match for 128 player conquest. I was frequently dumped into matches that were either finished or a few seconds away from finishing so I'd have to requeue immediately.

[b]Vehicles[/b]

Being in a vehicle is fun. Not being in a vehicle is not fun. Very difficult to fight back against a moderately skilled chopper pilot, even with guided missiles. I shouldn't need to play Engineer every round just to stand a chance.

[b]Spawning system[/b]

On multiple occasions I came very close to punching and breaking my laptop screen. The spawn system in this game is complete bullshit. I was regularly, CONSISTENTLY spawned in direct line of sight of enemies, sometimes even in the exact spot they were already firing, so that I died before I'd even gained control of my character. This is unacceptable. It doesn't help that choosing where you spawn is extremely inconsistent (If I pick C, I should spawn at C. I should not spawn next to B so that I have to walk to C. If I wanted to spawn at B, I would pick B) and sometimes doesn't work (you often can't spawn on your teammates for seemingly no reason, even if they're not in combat.

[b]Map design[/b]

Way too big, way too open, way too much walking around. This plus the spawn system means a lot of wasted time each game just trying to get to where you want to be.

[b]Other stuff[/b]

I will admit that for all the bullshit, I did still have some rare moments of fun. There were a few 'Battlefield' moments, where everythings exploding and the entire team rushes the point together. Those are cool. But they'd be cooler in any other Battlefield game.

This is a great Battlefield game to play but that wasn't originally the case. The game didn't have a very good launch, as it was initially plagued with technical bugs and gameplay imbalances. Since then however, it has been improved upon to the point that it now offers a great gameplay experience. As with previous Battlefield titles, this game provides an outstanding immersive experience thanks to its great graphics, sound effects, and gunplay.

As its title suggests, the game's events take place in the year 2042. After several environmental disasters and global societal collapse, only 2 superpowers remain: the United States and Russia. While the game focus is on their worldwide conflicts, it doesn't have any impact on gameplay since both factions have access to the same weapons and equipment. Even though both sides possess some faction specific vehicles, it doesn't matter again since they share similar characteristics to promote balanced gameplay.

You can count on Battlefield games to offer an incredible immersive experience and Battlefield 2042 is no exception. The graphics look amazing. The sound effects are incredibly realistic sounding. The gunplay is responsive and fluid. Some maps even have scripted weather events like tornadoes and sandstorms which impact gameplay. You can get caught in a tornado if you get to close to it.

Break. There are a large number of different weapons classes in the game. Assault rifles. LMGs. SMGs. Sniper Rifles. DMR's. Shotguns. Crossbows. Pistols. melee attacks and executions. RPGs. Anti air weapons. However, there are so many weapons in each class that it leads to overlapping characteristics among some weapons.

There are also many different vehicle classes available for use. tanks. Jeeps. infantry fighting vehicles. jets. helicopters. quad copter. hovercraft. While there aren't too many vehicles in each class, they share similar characteristics as to promote game balance.

However, there are some negatives to the game. it's common for vehicle sounds to sometimes cut out as a result of so many game sounds running concurrently. This can lead to tanks inadvertently sneaking up on unaware players who didn't hear these ordinarily loud vehicles. the game's building destruction is inconsistent, with many buildings having limited or no destructibility due to map design. Battlefield 2042 features various levels of environmental destruction, from micro-destruction of small objects and debris to large-scale destruction that allows players to create new paths by blowing holes in walls.

In closing, I think Battlefield 2042 is a great game to play. It offers gamers a consistent battlefield gameplay and immersive experience that they've come to expect. And that's why I gave this game a score rating of 8 out of 10.",1758095889,16902.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Battlefield 2042.. What can I say, I pre ordered 4 years ago here on Steam, played closed and open beta, I was really disappointed and it was a mess, a horrible mess, then I got refunded. Now, now this game it is what should have been 4 years ago, really! I am impressed, but it is not exactly what BF3 or BF4 was or Battlefield 1, which was the last BF title that had some of the DNA of this series, at least for me, lets say BF 2042 is different, maybe they tried something new, it is good now, but the game is at the end of his days and many come here for the goodies you will get in BF 6 from the free battle pass and if you come from the BF 6 open beta to this you will hate it since is different, the TTK (time to kill) is faster than what in BF 6 open beta, BF 6 goes a bit more back to what old school Battlefield series was, seems more balanced, try it if you got it for under 3 euros or on discount, definitely better than BF V and Call of Duty tittles right now, if they put all the dedication which was in this one in BF 6 too maybe the hope that EA did not ruin this tittle too is alive.Still found some bugs here and there, not game breaking but still, after 4 years for some of them developers should be ashamed, especially for the one that force you to turn off the EA overlay so you can open the game since it will give an on their way error as they say when you want to open the game, which did not happen for more than 130 hours of the game then after an over 700 mb update the magical error appeared and it's spread among many players.

Review:

I bought Battlefield 2042 because I wanted to experience the future of warfare. The future, apparently, is 127 people running around like headless chickens while I get sniped from across the map by a guy named “xX420NoScopeJesusXx.”

Highlights of my career as a soldier of tomorrow:

Spawned in, immediately died to a hovercraft doing donuts on a skyscraper.

Called in a tank, crushed by my own tank. Respect the circle of life.

Tried to revive a teammate—he gave up mid-revive and bled out while staring directly into my eyes. Haunting.

Climbed a 50-story building for “tactical advantage,” got hit by a tornado, ended up in Narnia.

Discovered the wingsuit. Spent 2 hours pretending I was in Just Cause 4. Killed no one, had the time of my life.

My specialist shouted a quirky one-liner right after I got blasted by a rocket launcher. Very immersive.

The game promised “All-Out Warfare.” They delivered. Just not sure if it’s against the enemy team or my own sanity.

1517290,False,"
In its current state, there’s little to complain about regarding the performance of Battlefield 2042. The game runs smoothly and without major issues. However, the design choices behind the maps leave much to be desired. Most of them feel like vast, empty fields with very little cover, making gameplay repetitive and uninspired. Even in team deathmatch, the maps are often either far too large or far too open, which hurts the pacing and intensity.

Spawn points can also be frustrating, sometimes placing players miles away from the action. Another strange design choice is the flow between matches: instead of seamlessly moving to the next round, the game kicks you back to the main menu before starting again. It feels unnecessary and disruptive.

On the positive side, the weapon mechanics are solid, the vehicles feel fine, and performance is great, the game runs buttery smooth. Unfortunately, good performance (now after 4 years) alone isn’t enough to make the game feel like a true Battlefield experience. Destruction, a defining feature of the series, is almost completely absent. Most maps lack personality or atmosphere, with only a few exceptions that manage to stand out.

Another major issue is how heavily casualized the game feels compared to its predecessors. The introduction of operators and their cringe voice-lines at the end of a round, which were later forced into loosely defined class systems, was probably one of the biggest mistakes the developers could have made. This change stripped away much of the tactical depth and identity that Battlefield was known for. Often, the maps and overall atmosphere feel strangely empty, more like a knock-off set in some alternate Rainbow Six Siege universe rather than a proper Battlefield game.

And then there's the soundtrack, which, with all due respect, is probably one of the worst I've ever heard. After just one hour, I turned the in-game music off entirely because it was more of an insult to the ears than an enhancement to the atmosphere. Whoever was responsible for the soundtrack should, frankly, never be allowed anywhere near the development studio again.

Overall, while Battlefield 2042 performs well technically, it falls short in nearly every other area. From uninspired maps and poor design choices to its disastrous soundtrack, the game fails to capture the soul, atmosphere, and identity that once defined the franchise.",1757880320,841.0,True,False,False,2,1,0.5251494646072387

Review:
Do you like paying full price for a tech demo? Do you dream of weapons that sound like Nerf guns, maps the size of small countries but with the action density of a retirement home, and “specialists” who all look like Fortnite interns on casual Friday, 128 players running marathons across empty maps, guns that sound like airsoft toys, Then boy, do I have a product for you.

This game promised “the future of Battlefield” and delivered… a futuristic PowerPoint presentation where bullets are optional, and patch notes are the real endgame.

1517290,True,"This Battlefield... It’s not a bad game in itself, far from it, but it suffers from major problems that spoil the experience, especially for the purists of the series:

Random and unstable ping: It’s the nightmare. During a game, my ping can suddenly reach 150 ms and get stuck like that. It’s all the more frustrating when on BF1 and BF5, I have absolutely no problem. It seems that EA and their servers have a complicated relationship...

Unbalanced maps: Some maps cruelly lack balance, which can quickly become boring.

Unintuitive interface: Compared to the clarity of BF1 or BF5, the interface here lacks readability and is less ergonomic.

Limited destructibility: It’s a major disappointment. One of the essences of Battlefield is the destruction of buildings. It’s a shame to see this feature so neglected.

(Optional) Absence of a real single-player campaign: Even if it is not the heart of the game for everyone, the lack of a scripted story, as we could have had in BF1 or BF5, leaves a taste of unfinished.

So, why recommend it anyway?
Despite these big flaws, I recommend this game for a simple reason: its price on promotion. For 3 euros, it would be a shame to miss it. We won’t complain too much at that price. It’s a title that allows one to let off steam and unwind when everything works out (which, let’s be honest, is not always the case).

I sincerely hope that EA will be able to set the bar right. They have an exceptional license in their hands, but it is unfortunately tarnished by decisions that seem more guided by pocket filling than by real skill in the video game.

1599340,False,"It's a horrible shame there is no other game that plays identical to Lost Ark because it is truly among my absolute favorite combat designs I've ever played. Sadly many aspects of the game that cannot be ignored represent enormous barriers to most of the enjoyment the game has in store.

I knew many months ago that I was reaching my personal stopping point after playing every week since launch. There are only so many thorns I can step on before I can no longer walk. Those thorns include fomo, homework, gatekeeping, pay-to-win, luck disparity/bad luck protection, miserable progression systems, progression behind time gates, progression that requires unrelated collectible farming, rampant bots, rampant RMT, and either sweats or imposters sucking the fun out of practically every raid that you don't do purely with your close friends/static raid group. And even then, even the tightest of groups seem to fall apart seemingly at random due to some level of drama or miscommunication. I'm quite happy ditching what felt to me like a community of adult children, but mileage may vary.

Absolutely do not play Lost Ark. What enjoyment it can bring you will be overshadowed by how long you will spend waiting for that enjoyment, and with every update; the new-player experience is made worse.",1767566074,162429.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5185185670852661
1599340,False,"I’ve been playing Lost Ark since the Western beta. At the time, I was working at Amazon in the IT department and wanted to be part of something different outside of my 9–5. I played the game pre-release and post-release, and in the beginning it genuinely felt exciting and fun.

Progressing through the story, exploring the world, and learning the systems was enjoyable—especially because I was playing alongside my best friend. Early on, the game felt rewarding and social, and there was a real sense of momentum as you moved forward.

However, once progression became heavily tied to gear honing, resource grinding, and item level requirements, the experience changed completely. The grind to increase item level became incredibly frustrating and time-consuming, to the point where it felt almost impossible without extreme dedication or spending. This is ultimately what caused my best friend to stop playing altogether.

On top of that, gatekeeping became a major issue. Endgame content increasingly revolves around strict requirements—high item levels, perfect engravings, optimal card sets, and specific classes—making it extremely difficult for returning, casual, or unlucky players to participate. Even when you meet the basic requirements, it’s common to be declined repeatedly from groups unless you vastly overgear the content.

This creates a cycle where:

You need raids to progress

But you can’t get into raids without already being over-progressed

Which pushes players toward burnout, bussing, or quitting entirely

I continued playing for longer—partly due to my connection with the company—but over time it became clear that Lost Ark feels less like a game and more like a second job. Daily chores, time-gated content, and FOMO-driven systems don’t respect the player’s time, especially for anyone with real-life responsibilities.

This sentiment is widely shared in the community. While Lost Ark has excellent combat, beautiful visuals, and some of the best raid designs in the genre, it relies heavily on:

Excessive daily and weekly homework

RNG-based progression that can feel punishing

A gatekeeping-heavy endgame culture that discourages new or returning players

Eventually, burnout becomes inevitable.

Now, I mostly log in only for new content, events, or free rewards, rather than playing consistently. The core gameplay is still impressive, but the overall progression and social systems make it hard to enjoy long-term unless the game becomes your main focus.

Lost Ark is a great game at its core—but one that struggles to balance ambition, accessibility, and community health. If you have unlimited time, you may love it. If not, it can quickly become exhausting.",1767453531,209577.0,True,False,False,3,2,0.5

1599340,True,"This game has been a constant in my life since its release, and now that I finally decided to hang it up it deserves a short review. I wouldn't directly recommend this game to everyone, but if you consider it you might as well give it a shot. I have been a pretty hardcore defender of lost ark through all the years, even now I don't think there is anything quite like it. My playtime might be slightly misleading with the amount of afk hours farmed in the first 2-3 years whilst wfh, but even taking that away I've spent an immense amount of time making memories both good and bad. It reignited my passion for MMOs with its community driven environment and unmatched combat, and I hope it'll keep thriving for as long as possible even if I am not around to experience it. There are many negatives to be said about the game but I'd just be repeating what people already expressed. I hope if you try this game, you will have at least some positive memories to take with you.

After 400 hours, I've played 95% of the game alone. There are virtually no players in T3, and it's designed so that you can play it alone because the developers know that you're completely on your own. I thought it would be better in T4 because it's “presumably” end-game content. Even there, I can't find any people, and if there is a party, you have to wait forever. I only see parties for end-end-game content, but until then, it's NOT an MMORPG just because you see some people in towns. And now comes the worst part: from T4 onwards, you realize that progress becomes difficult without the cash shop. I have nothing against progress becoming more difficult, but I haven't found a way to grind. All you can do are dailies and weeklies.

Worst new player experience in existence. Due to weekly lockouts, you will spend months soloing content nobody runs anymore before catching up to current endgame, where you will be gatekept - because game strongly encourages running 3 raids per week on 6 chars, people want fast clears and won't risk taking someone inexperienced as they really want their 18 weekly raids to take 30 minutes each rather than 3 hours each. If you endure, after a few months you can catch up, somewhat. You can also swipe to skip the grind, but being gatekept for no experience will still apply.

Game is pay to win in the sense that it enables cash to in-game currency exchange. There's technically no advantage over other players that can be obtained exclusively by swiping, but paying enough can skip literal years of grinding, making you relatively stronger than players who spent less.

1599340,False,"I will leave you my few cents regarding lostark, as someone with over 9k hours in the game for the past 3 years, think i can pretty much tell you the reason why you SHOULD and SHOULDN'T play this game at all.

So for the SHOULD:

Are you unemployed or rich? then definitely this might be the game for you, as it currently stands for a ready to raid player, you will be needing either a lot of time to catch up, or spend more than 5K USD on RMT to have your basic stuff ready for it.
Do you enjoy combat with great feel design? then again this game is definitely for you, LostArk biggest strength lies on it's combat feel.

Now for the SHOULDN'T:
If you are someone who is not prepared to be put through long playing time because either there is someone who is messing up a lot with late raids, then yeah expect to lose a lot of time in pulls
If you are someone who gets frustated because the class you picked up is doing poorly, then again you are out of luck, smilegate(the developer) has been pretty bad at balancing older classes vs newly released ones
Are you familiar with WOW fomo systems? then be prepared that every new raid might introduce a new GOLD SINK and a NEW PROGRESSION system
Are you someone who enjoys having to get your feedback ignored? Then be prepared, while AMAZON does a good job at compiling a lot of the feedback, the sad reality is that it gets ignored by SMILEGATE.
Are you someone who wants to min-max? Well that's too bad because SMILEGATE doesn't like it that you can min max your build or char, there is always a need to keep you running on the wheel
You like raiding a lot? Well good news, currently you can do up to 18 raids a week between 6 CHARACTERS
Oh also i forgot, unless you are putting some $$$ into the game, then you must be mindful on your investment into your characters too, hence those 18 raids a week done might be done for you to funnel a character into a hard raid status raid ready while the rest rots in the bottom.

While Lostark has creative raid and combat designs, it is constantly constrained and weighted down by many of the system designs that Smilegate wants to push forward, there is no denying in the potential that the game could have, is still there, locked behind an incompetent developer that listens to whales first rather than the casual player
Yes there are still express events that will let you raise 1 character to a playable status but this won't be enough for you to feel at an okay pace to play the game, my honest opinion is that really there are better things to do, learn a language, workout more, or other useful things, LOSTARK is not a game you want to currently play unless you can ignore all the SHOULDN'T and can be okay with the SHOULD to play it.

So yeah that's it folks, if you play and don't want to stress, make 6 valkyries and go full support or 6 bards too, then you have boobs and not so rough time.

So yeah imma go keep playing more WH40k Rogue trader

1599340,False,"Tbh, it’s one of the games with the best combat feel I’ve ever played. Especially when Slayer came out the character’s skills and sword were so satisfying that I could’ve turned all my alts into Slayers. But after a certain point, the game became unplayable because of gatekeeping. I quit about two years ago, but I wanted to come back and take a look.

But what I saw was the same thing again. The game was full of bots. When I last quit, it was pay-to-win, but now it has basically become pay-to-play. You literally can’t move without spending money. And you’re still forced to do your dailies with every character like some kind of slave. I don’t understand how a company can ignore its players this much. Even putting that aside, why are the bosses still so punishing? With this much gatekeeping and such a solid foundation for a great game, why not just make the game actually playable?

I mean, you can’t even find a group for the bosses you need to fight every week to upgrade certain items, sometimes spending hours, days, or even weeks trying. Some people just quit in the later stages because they don’t want to bother. The old raid is meaningless, the gameplay feels pointless. The sense of progression drops so much after a certain gear score that I can’t even find a single reason to keep playing this game.

Honestly, it’s one of the rare games with really great level and combat design in my eyes, but I think it will shut down eventually like New World, so I’d say don’t bother at all.

This is, quite possibly, one of the worst things ever released onto the Steam platform.

I actually didn't write a negative review like 2 years ago when I stopped playing because I was just so impressed by how impressive the psychological tactics were that it honestly should be a positive review. 
This game is a brilliantly toxic product that targets its audience who are pretty much all basement-dwelling rats with non existent awareness, tricking them into believing that running the same meaningless chore on twelve alt-characters is a valuable life contribution to their imaginary community. It makes you feel valuable surviving on welfare checks by convincing you that maintaining your roster level just to find a group for a raid is some sort of a noble calling of you leading some sort of heroes that give you the imaginary perception of being better than other people when in reality you’ve just built a sweatshop for yourself. Every day you feed them Chaos Dungeon rations, send them to do your busywork, and somehow convinced yourself that funneling mats into your main is real life progress.
The monetization is the final humiliation: your 400 hours of grinding for an upgrade, thinking it was all worth it for that +1 honing success only to instantly fail and having all your gold evaporate when one bored banker by swiping his Amex on a lunch break gets his cartoon sword shinier than you. And the worst part? You know this, but you still log in the next day and whisper to yourself ""one more try"". That’s the level of psychological brilliance of exploiting FOMO we're dealing with, disguised as fantasy. You’re chasing timers like they owe you rent. You log in out of guilt, collect your daily “rewards,” and tell yourself it’s self-care. It’s the first game where burnout is an official feature, and logging off feels like quitting your job without notice.
It’s addictive and fundamentally rotten. The perfect mix of dopamine, despair, and denial is a monument to how far humanity will go to feel “productive” while achieving absolutely nothing.

I love the gameplay, the character asthetics, the raids, and (about 40%) of the horizontal progression.

Unfortunatley this game tries its hardest to stop you from enjoying those things

You will be logging in every day doing the same 3-4 tasks everyday until reset when you get to enjoy the good part of the game. Which is sadly boring after you learn the one raid you are allowed to do that week, which you will be repeating FOR WEEKS because this game has that terrible korean monitization tactic that incentivises you to swipe your credit card for gear progress.
Which I wouldn't mind if this game had any meaningful or fun content to keep you busy in the meantime.

This game is a second job.

Don't even get me started on the terribly boring and long story that you have to do a minimum of six times (or swipe that card!) to level six characters to max to do dalies on them everyday for efficiency. ( I understand beauty is the eye of the beholder but you couldn't pay me to slog through that hand holding trash again)

Leveling a character from scratch without an event is also a pain in the rear, they didn't make the gearing system for t3 mid super easy (like every other korean mmo i've ever played) so you could catch up to where literally everyone else in the MMO is (t3 end- t4 early). 

All content outside of where everyone else is? Dead, most islands don't get participants even at peak times unless it gives something specific that everyone needs, not to mention alot of content is timed so you can't do it when you want.

1599340,False,"The MMO That demands your Credit Card !  Welcome to lost ark
When a certain CONTENT Creator says this game respects your time he could not be more wrong. 
This game demands your time while not letting you spend time in the game.

They have only begun taking action against rule breakers lately but for years the game has been plagued with rule breakers to the point where half the population you randomly meet on the street is a guranteed rmter or cheater or botter.

My main issue with this game isnt that its grindy... like some people its the fact the game straight up DOES NOT LET YOU GRIND ENOUGH.
The game essientially demands an insane amount of gold upkeep otherwise you wont be able to do the  latest raid. 
now i have played f2p games in the past that were pay to win but the difference is in majority of those games you arent hard gold locked after a certain amount of entires in a raid. When most people say either grind or spend money this game does not allow the former 18 raids a week is not enough gold to even keep up with a spending player. 

I really tried to play this game but the downfall came when the game implemented elixirs and transendence and other systems that demanded gold whilst simultanelously not allowing you to grind for your own gold beyond 18 raids a week.

So then how are some people so geared if you are locked out of gold after 18 raids?? MONEY P2W DOLLAR DOLLAR BILLS YOO
Unfortunately this game is designed around making you spend money and if you arent spending money the game actively seems to be working to make your life experience worse until you finally do spend money, Smilegate devs work against the player quality of life experience rather then working with players.

This game is the complete opposite of a play at your own pace game, i personally enjoy playing mmos for 16 hours a day this game straight up lacks content to do so without locking you out of gold acquisition. A casual who tries to play the game for 5 hours a week without swiping will also struggle to get into raids due to the game not providing permanent incentives to help new players without an expense to themselves.

Normally in a different MMO people are not hostile to helping new players... after they clear the raid themselves however what is very different in lost ark is the fact that the people who have cleared are on a once per week per character lock out where they straight up cannot reenter the raid for the week after clearing once. What does this mean?
It means normally people who want to help people can either only help people once a week and they risk themselves having a much worse experience for the week because if you get stuck on a gate of a raid in this game it is generally hard to find parties reforming. And in the event they do manage to help people the people who want to help people clear raids cannot help enough people as they are one person in a raid and they have one hard raid lockout.
What this leads to is a hostile game for new players due to people being very naturally inclined to not help you due to game Passively discouraging you from trying to help new players.

MOKOKO EVENTS ARE BANDAIDS. THEY DO NOTHING TO SOLVE LONG TERM ISSUES, JUST ALLOW UNLIMITED RAID ENTRIES AND YOU GET TEACHER PARTIES FOR FREE BOOSTING BUSSING ALSO HELPS BOOSTING NORMAL PLAYERS ITS BETTER TO TAKE AN L AND GIVE THE BUSSERS UNLIMITED ENTIRES IF IT ALSO MEANS SAVING THE GAME BECAUSE TEACHERS WHO RERUN RAIDS 50 TIMES A WEEK FOR FUN CANNOT AS OF RIGHT NOW.

I struggle to find who this game is designed for besides the biggest whales in existence that swipe thousands on a game.
Most anti player game ive seen in my life. 

Dont get me started on the fact that the game has one of the worst social systems of any mmo ever which leads to huge player animosity. 

Y'know something amazon regardless of all the negatives ive said about the game you've had to carry through from smilegate i might have given you props if you gave more effort to saving the game or managing it then you did.
ROX who is a CM for this game literally HAS NOT DONE A SINGLE LEGION RAID NOT VALTAN NOT ANYTHING .
im sorry but if you dont play the game you manage you are not a good cm and that is why this game is struggling because you cannot relate to any of the players never mind the fact that player support is just auto sourced indian tech support.

If i could dislike this game 1000 on steam times at the cost of it meaning never disliking another game in my life i would do it  because thats what this game deserves. 

A bad community is the sign of a bad game and thats what lost ark is. 
Meet one bad apple, then that person is a bad guy , if everyone in a certain community you meet is bad there is something larger influencing that and that is the case here in lost ark. 

To the content creator i cannot name buddy if you didnt clickbait people at the start of this game with your video there would be less haters for this game on reddit you are partially the cause of those deranged redditors.

Before i close this off what are the positives of this game that made a person like me stick around for over 10k hours? well the combat is addicting but everything about the game of lost ark besides that is something you would find out of a sewer.

TLDR- Game is an MMO that does nothing well besides combat
Game is P2W and not P2W you can out grind due to game not being grindy enough.
New players struggle due to playerbase being passively from game itself to not help new players.
ROX and other AGS Staff do not play their game so staff that works on game cannot relate to player struggles in any regard. 
Cheaters have ran rampant in lost ark for ages and only having action taken against after 3 years.

Pro tip to anyone building an mmo dont hard timegate your userbase out of everything 3 raids a week on your main character is not enough allow your playerbase the ability to rerun your raids, dont use bussers as a boogey man thats what politicians do with people of a certain skin color to prevent people from having a better life, work to improve your game even if some people you dislike benefit if it means everyone has a better experience. This crab mentality of ill shoot myself in the foot if it means a busser will suffer is why lost ark is in the dumps

1599340,False,"Hello everyone,

Having over 3,500 hours of play, I think I'm legitimate enough to write a review.

I'll try to structure my reasoning by starting with the negative points:

The two biggest red flags are the publisher's development team, AGS, and the community.
AGS started to listen to its players a little when the game's population declined by 20.
Unfortunately, over the past few months, they decided there were still players to drive away, and they decided to remove French and German from the game. They also removed the portability of many keyboards such as AZERTY, QWERTZ, etc. For those who play with keyboards removed, you will be penalized because there are certain fights that require QTEs.
The community is also very, very toxic. Being a P2W, there are a lot of egos, and instead of helping each other with a relatively low playing population, they prefer to continue to sink each other. There are still some people who want to help old returners and new players, but the vast majority prefer that they play in their corner in solo raid (the height of it for a game that calls itself Massive Multiplayer Online) so as not to bother them.

regarding positive points, having played several MMO RPGs, Lost Ark's graphic style and combat are unparalleled. The soundtracks for the encounters enhance the combat. The story is very interesting and very long. You'll need dozens of hours to complete the main quest (still ongoing), featuring one of the best antagonists ever created in a game: Kharmine.
There are some areas for improvement regarding the daily workload. They reduced the number of Chaos Dungeons and Guardians to one per day per character. But unfortunately, they implemented a new seasonal feature: Paradise, which, despite all the rewards it provides, once again requires a considerable amount of time to dedicate to this activity.
There are regular events to try to catch up on the released content. In any case, all the Legion raids are obsolete, as are the beginnings of the Kazeros raids. With only 10,000 players connected simultaneously, raids outside of the four most recent ones are practically impossible to do due to the lack of groups (except for solo raids).
Make no mistake, if you want to join the latest raid, which will be released in November, you have two choices: Either have picked up the game several months ago, or pay up your credit card and spend thousands of euros.
In conclusion:

Lost Ark is a unique game with great qualities, but unfortunately it's been undermined by its evolution curve, which resembles a Las Vegas casino, as well as its toxic community.
It's a free game; you can download it and try it out to get a feel for it.

1599340,False,"The game encapsulates everything that makes an MMO completely terrible. 
- Time limited content (Dailies). A complete disrespect to the players time, while also nudging the players to log out of the game once they are done
- RNG based gear upgrades (why not make the gear itself a drop chance to be hype over, instead of your resources maybe being useful or wasted). 
- Every server is a separate account, meaning you have to do all of your roster and character progress from scratch, if you need to switch server to play with a friend. And btw, you cannot move a character to another server or matchmake between servers, which almost kills the MMO aspect
- Heavy P2W. What makes what a player has accomplished special, if you can simply pay your way to it? What proves to others and yourself, that your achievements and gear are the result of skill, knowledge and time?

The combat and the world design is amazing, visual effects and class identity is almost peak, but it is wrapped around a turd of horrible game design that does everything perfectly horrible.

My suggestion: 
-Make Lost Ark monthly subscription, scrap the entire microtransaction shop and make cosmetics a result of gameplay and achievements instead, exactly like titles and collection. 
- Get rid of all daily, weekly, general time limited stuff, when the player has the time they should be able to play as much as they want under the same conditions. 
- Introduce non-raid based gear progression and remove the entire honing system. Swap it out for gear drops across various activities, where the uses of different gear have different uses throughout different content (horisontal progression).
- Suggest potential new content to the player base, make them have a say and what they would like, since they will be paying monthly.
- Make roster progress tied to your account, so it is shared across all servers. 
- Make cross server matchmaking possible
- Make character server migration possible, maybe with a cooldown to reduce server stress
- When adding new content, make sure it acts as an alternative and in very rare cases a direct upgrade

1599340,True,"After almost 3000 hours in Lost Ark, I can confidently say it’s one of the best MMOs if you enjoy challenging PvE content. The raid design and combat system are unmatched — every boss fight feels unique, and clearing hard content is an unforgettable experience.

There’s also a huge amount of horizontal content. Even with all my playtime, I’ve barely completed half of the available achievements and collectibles. On top of that, the cinematics, soundtrack, and story presentation make exploring Arkesia truly immersive and memorable.

That said, the game isn’t perfect. The community leans hardcore, which can create gatekeeping and raid anxiety, especially in the latest raids at the highest difficulties. However, this is much less of an issue now thanks to solo mode content, which lets you progress at your own pace without depending on others. Plus, if you make friends or join a guild, there are plenty of friendly communities willing to help new and returning players.

The weekly raid cycle can sometimes feel like repetitive “homework,” and the layered RNG systems can be frustrating. Also, the time you can spend on your main character is limited — dailies are short, raids are weekly-locked, and events don’t last long, so alts are almost mandatory if you want more playtime. On top of that, the learning curve for newcomers is steep, especially when it comes to engravings, gearing, and raid mechanics.

This is definitely a flawed game with p2w but long-time players play despite the issues because the raid gameplay is just that good. The other parts of the game will provide a few hundred hours of gameplay but they're not nearly as engaging as the raids. 

Many of the problems that plagued Lost Ark in its early years have been alleviated or solved. For example, chaos dungeons and guardian raids are only once a day, raids are generally only two gates (compared to the old Brelshaza raid that had 6 gates), and alts aren't necessary to play the latest raids. However, the content is timegated weekly so people typically make more alts to play more. Gatekeeping is still present but is alleviated for new/returning players with the mokoko bootcamp that gives veteran players an incentive to bring newbies to raids. There are also revives available in raids and progressive nerfs to raid boss HP/damage so the pressure during week to week reclearing has been greatly reduced.

1599340,True,"I don’t usually write reviews on Steam, but the recent changes to Lost Ark are quite juicy. As a returning player who participated in Brel Hard prog and quit afterward, I genuinely believe these updates could save Lost Ark. Hear me out:

Solo Raids:
Extremely friendly for new and returning players. They’re easy, have no tight DPS checks, and are enjoyable even if you're not already familiar with the raid. You can also earn tons of honing materials for both your main and alts to catch up.

Raid Design Changes:
The newer raids have reduced difficulty—fewer wipe mechanics and one-shot attacks. You can even revive during raids now. With the Mokoko title, players are much more willing to take you along even if you haven’t cleared it before. My main is now 1660 after just two weeks (due to the powerpass), I’ve had no trouble getting into raids at my item level. ( The highest raid currently requires item level 1680.)

Daily Quest QoL:
No more daily Una Tasks—yes,Finally! Weekly Una Tasks still exist, but you can complete them just by running Chaos Dungeons three times a week. Even if you're playing six characters, it no longer feels like a second job.

Events:
There are tons of new events, and you’ll get a full set of Legendary skin jars just for logging in. A year ago, I wouldn’t have recommended Lost Ark to any of my friends. But now, I honestly think it’s a great time to return to the game.

1599340,True,"Personally I very much enjoy this game. I say I maybe recommend it rather than fully recommend it because it's a large investment. The story from level 1-60 isn't too taxing, but once you hit 60 and get into endgame content, things can get confusing. I'll be honest, and call me a noob all you want, but I still have to look at guides to understand a lot of things. I have certain memory and processing problems, and find it difficult to retain all of the information needed to create a good character build. It can get extremely overwhelming.

Some people will get very toxic in party content if you don't know every little detail about your character build, so don't fat finger a key in your rotation during endgame raids. They mean serious business. They will kick you and be-smite your name forever.

Thankfully, the developers have kindly introduced solo endgame content for losers like me who A) Don't interact with other people well due to generalized anxiety disorder, and B) don't know our rotations and get through fights by sheer luck and button smashing (At least I'm honest). I am graeatly thankful for that.

On the positive side, there is tons of content. There are multiple different raids and dungeons that you can do daily or weekly, as well as tasks. There's the Ark tour, the sidequests, your Stronghold to keep up with, the proving grounds PvP, my personal favorite fun game: the tower, and so many events thet always give rewards. 

Lost Ark is expensive to create the best builds, but it is not entirely impossible to F2P. Events often give away special loot to help develop your character, as do endgame dungeons and raids. something extremely useful, particularly if you have alts that you don't want to level from 1-60, but don't have the gold for knowledge transfer is the powerpass. Normally you have to buy it with gems, but during a lot of events you will be given one for free, so as long as you are already knowledgeable enough of high level character building and content, or willing to spend a lot of time learning, I reccomend using them to skip some character levels.

TL;DR: Lost Ark is a great game if you can afford the time and investment. If you get overwhelmed, search for guides. If you can't avoid trolls, play solo content, it's nice and quiet.

1599340,True,"An Epic Adventure Worth Every Second – Lost Ark

Lost Ark is hands-down one of the most exhilarating and content-rich MMORPGs I’ve ever played. From the moment I set foot in Arkesia, I was blown away by the sheer scale, detail, and polish of the world. The game blends fast-paced, action-packed combat with deep RPG mechanics and stunning visuals.

What truly sets Lost Ark apart is its combat system — fluid, responsive, and incredibly satisfying. Every class feels unique, with flashy skills and dynamic combos that make each battle feel impactful and rewarding. Whether I’m slicing through hordes of enemies or taking down massive bosses, the game play never gets old.

The PvE content is massive: dungeons, raids, world bosses, island quests — there’s always something new to explore. And if you're into PvP, the competitive modes are balanced and intense, offering plenty of challenge and excitement.

On top of that, the game’s progression system is both deep and rewarding. There's always a goal to chase — whether it’s upgrading gear, unlocking collectables, or completing epic story arcs.

And let’s not forget the visuals — Lost Ark is absolutely gorgeous. The environments are rich and diverse, the effects are eye-catching, and the attention to detail is top-tier.

If you’re a fan of MMORPGs or action RPGs, Lost Ark is a must-play. It's free-to-play, incredibly generous with content, and has a thriving community. It’s more than a game — it’s an adventure you’ll want to lose yourself in.",1752139925,2908.0,True,False,False,1,2,0.5

Incredible game held back by bad systems.

Lost Ark has the best ARPG combat and animations I’ve ever seen. The classes are fun, PvE is challenging, and the raids and dungeons are well-designed. The art and character design are top-notch, and the small group content makes connecting with others easier.

But there are two big issues:

Pay-to-win is real. Over time, the game shifted to heavily reward spending money, especially if you want to keep up with guilds or higher-end content.

The grind is brutal. Managing multiple characters daily feels more like a chore than fun, and the constant FOMO wears you down.

[list]
[*] to get this raiding experience you will need to invest similar time to a part time job, ideally 3-4 hours per day and a bit more on weekend
[*] if you don't or if, god forbid, you decide to start playing now, you will be discriminated against in party finder or you will be forced to pay real life money to catch up 
[*] p2w, technically a pve game so you can't really p2w, however the damage difference between someone that pays and someone who doesn't is massive, this gets worse with new gear and gets better the longer a patch lasts. It's not as bad as bdo as there is nothing you ""need"" to buy , but it still leaves a sour feeling when you spend so much time grinding and some whale comes and max his gear day 1 of a new patch as soon as he has the new gear. It devalues the effort you put in.
[*] there is nothing to do outside of raids thats worthwile, pvp is dead, side content is dead and boring
[*] classic korean balacing, if you know you know
[*] THE MOST INSANE RNG PROGRESSION SYSTEM. The quality weapon system is a random bullshit that exponentially increases your damage and later stages are locked behind no pity rng, someone could spend 300 gold, someone 3 million.
I thought they could never top this, as it's as unfriendly as it is, made to fix the insane inflation caused by their shortsight vision of how a game where you can print infinite gold by raiding would work. BUT NO, they introuduced elixirs and there is where i dipped out, it came to a point where i was spending more time cutting elixirs (going trough a google spreadsheet to optimally select various options) then ACTUALLY RAIDING. From what i've heard even more frustrating system have been introuced since then.

1599340,True,"Game is fun, but you will eventually have to spend money if you want to progress your character/account. Worth playing until that point, it does get a bit repetitive. The main story is quite long however i didn't read a single dialog message in the entire game LOL (I played the game for the combat clearly). There are a few missions in the game that are very memorable but they are few and far between. Most of the time you are told to go here, kill that, go here collect that. So it is very grind. 

With that being said, the game is beautiful and the characters feel fun. The sound in the game is very good, when you hit enemies you really ""feel"" like you are hitting them due to the sounds the game has (lots of bass, boom sound effects etc if that makes sense). 

The raids in the game i expected to be much better than they are. I was expecting more of a big dungeon crawl but instead its just a single boss battle. Not terrible just think it could have been more.Multiplayer and teaming up with friends is kinda frustrating and borderline not worth the trouble. The game constantly separates you into different ""channels"" within the world you are in, so if you aren't in the same channel you wont see your friends. Honestly playing with others playing the story content isn't even needed as you can pretty much solo everything without a problem. 

I played this game for over 250 hours but decided to uninstall as i reached the point where the game requires money to move forward. Was fun while it lasted.

1599340,False,"TL;DR: A great game, but way too expensive

First off, the biggest positive of this game (for me) - it has the most satisfying combat system in an ARPG I have played. The skills are visually intensive, feel impactful, powerful. The boss fights are good, often have individual mechanics while being readable and well telegraphed. Learning a new raid is a satisfying experience, playing a raid is a satisfying experience. Getting into one - not so much.

And this is where it all goes downhill. The game has multiple gear progression systems, which are both mandatory (to the point you can't enter an encounter without meeting some requirements) and VERY expensive. This creates a pretty unpleasant environment for players who don't want to spend either too much money or too much time in the game. And to make things worse, spending only too much time doesn't cut it. You get enough to meet the ""minimum requirements"" for the most recent content, but nowhere near enough to be considered ""strong"". As a result, the LFG experience is often extremely frustrating. You can legitimately spend more time trying to join or gather a group than you spend afterwards playing the raid. 

This is what drove me away from the game in the end. I was playing the maximum allowed 6 characters in the endgame in order to maximize my income so that I could stay at the ""poorly geared"" category. It's exhausting and not worth it, despite the satisfying experience of the actual gameplay.

I would gladly go back to the game in case they make a major overhaul of the endgame structure, scrap the multiple-character gold earning and reduce the power gap between the free-to-play users and the whales.

I don't know if the developers can solve this as it depends mostly of the community, maybe to ease the difficulty of the raids even more, or add more resurrections tries per raid.

Ah yes, *Lost Ark*, the game that promises a grand adventure across a beautifully crafted world—right after you spend 45 minutes in a queue, click through 27 fetch quests, and lose a gear upgrade to an RNG system that hates you.  

---  

### **🎮 The Experience: A Rollercoaster of Hope and Despair**  

✔ **Step 1:** Get blown away by the combat. Seriously, the combat is *phenomenal*. Skills hit like a truck, animations are crisp, and mobs explode in a satisfying mess of particle effects.  

✔ **Step 2:** Realize the story is a glorified door-opening simulator. Your grand destiny? Escorting NPCs, watching a *very* dramatic cutscene, and then clicking ""G"" until your keyboard begs for mercy.  

✔ **Step 3:** Hit the endgame and enter the Great Wall of RNG. You thought your grind was over? Cute. Now, watch in horror as your gear upgrade fails five times in a row, and you start questioning your life choices.  

✔ **Step 4:** Find out whales have better gear than you *because they have a credit card*. Fun fact: You can either farm for *weeks* or just swipe once. *Your move, peasant.*

### **🔥 The Pros (Yes, There Are Some)**  
✅ **Combat:** Flashy, impactful, and genuinely fun. If only the rest of the game respected your time as much as the combat does.  
✅ **Raids & Dungeons:** Amazing mechanics, challenging fights, and actual teamwork required—assuming you didn’t quit out of frustration before reaching them.  
✅ **Visuals:** The game is drop-dead gorgeous. Shame you’ll mostly be staring at UI windows and upgrade failure messages.  
✅ **It’s Free!** But at what cost? (Hint: Your sanity.)  

---  

### **The Cons (Aka, Your Journey Into Madness)**  
❌ **The Story:** Generic, predictable, and stretched thinner than my patience waiting for dailies to reset.  
❌ **Endgame Progression:** You like gambling, kid? Because gear upgrades are basically a Vegas slot machine rigged against you.  
❌ **The Grind:** Daily quests, weekly resets, and time-gated content to keep you hooked like an MMO hamster on a wheel.  
❌ **Pay-to-Win Elements:** Sure, you *can* grind your way up… or you can just, y’know, buy your way there.  

---  

### **🎭 Final Verdict**  
*Lost Ark* is like a toxic relationship: amazing at first, but slowly draining the life out of you the longer you stay. If you love punishing RNG, endless grind loops, and getting flexed on by players with deep pockets, then congrats—this is your new home.  

For everyone else? Enjoy the honeymoon phase, because reality hits hard when you reach the endgame.

1599340,False,"Ah, Lost Ark—a game so drenched in greed that even Skeletor himself must tip his hood in reluctant admiration. This so-called ""adventure"" is less about exploring mystical lands and more about exploring the depths of your wallet. Let's dissect this predatory monstrosity, shall we?

Graphics and Sound: At first glance, Lost Ark dazzles with its vibrant visuals and orchestral scores, much like a siren luring sailors to their doom. But don't be fooled; this is merely the sugar coating on a poison pill.

Gameplay: Prepare yourself for a grind so tedious it would make even the most patient dungeon crawler weep. Quests are repetitive, requiring you to traverse from point A to point B, perform trivial tasks, and slaughter hordes of mindless foes. The monotony is relentless, designed to wear down your resolve until you succumb to the game's insidious monetization schemes.

Pay-to-Win Mechanics: Ah, the pièce de résistance of this digital extortion racket. Lost Ark's endgame progression is locked behind a system so blatantly pay-to-win, it might as well come with a neon sign flashing ""Insert Credit Card to Proceed."" Players are funneled into purchasing in-game currency to enhance their gear, creating a chasm between the haves and the have-nots. This isn't just a shortcut; it's a blatant ""pay or be left behind"" ultimatum.

Community and Support: Expect a community rife with gatekeeping and elitism, where only those who have paid their way to the top are deemed worthy. The developers, much like the dark sorcerers they are, remain aloof, offering little in the way of meaningful support or communication.

Final Verdict: Lost Ark is less a game and more a meticulously crafted trap, designed to ensnare and exploit. Its alluring facade hides a core rotten with greed, preying upon the wallets of the unsuspecting. Heed this warning and steer clear, lest you find yourself another victim of its avaricious grasp.

Final Score: 💀☐☐☐☐ - Skeletor urges you to run away.

With over 300 hours in Lost Ark, I can say that this game offers one of the best action MMORPG experiences out there. It blends fast-paced combat, deep progression systems, and a massive world filled with content that can keep you engaged for hundreds of hours. Whether you're into PvE, PvP, or just exploring its beautiful world, Lost Ark has something for everyone.

[h3][b]The Good: Visually Stunning and Incredibly Addictive[/b][/h3]

One of Lost Ark’s biggest strengths is its stunning visuals. Every environment is beautifully designed, from the lush open fields to dark dungeons filled with terrifying enemies. The animations and effects make combat feel satisfying, especially with the over-the-top abilities each class has. The game delivers an epic cinematic experience while maintaining a smooth and responsive gameplay flow.

[h3][b]Combat – A Masterclass in Action RPGs[/b][/h3]

The combat is, without a doubt, one of the best in any MMORPG. Each class feels distinct, with fluid animations, powerful attacks, and mechanics that reward skillful play. Whether you're chaining together devastating combos or dodging enemy attacks in high-speed raids, the action never gets old. Boss fights are intense and require coordination, making PvE content both challenging and rewarding.

[h3][b]Tons of Content – Never a Dull Moment[/b][/h3]

One thing Lost Ark does exceptionally well is keeping you busy. From its massive PvE raids, world bosses, and dungeons to PvP arenas and large-scale battles, there's always something to do. The game's progression system gives players a constant sense of improvement, whether it’s leveling up, enhancing gear, or exploring new regions.

[h3][b]The Downsides: Grind and Monetization[/b][/h3]

Like many MMORPGs, Lost Ark does require a fair amount of grinding, especially when reaching the endgame. While the content is fun, progressing through gear upgrades and honing can become repetitive. The game's monetization system also leans into pay-to-win territory, particularly with fast-track upgrades for gear progression, which can be frustrating for some players. However, with patience and time investment, free-to-play players can still experience most of the content without spending money.

[h3][b]Final Verdict: A Must-Play MMORPG for Action Fans[/b][/h3]

Despite its grind and monetization mechanics, Lost Ark remains one of the most enjoyable MMORPGs out there. The combat is top-tier, the world is immersive, and the variety of content ensures that you’ll never run out of things to do. Whether you’re a solo adventurer or someone who loves playing with friends, Lost Ark is a game that can easily hook you for hundreds of hours.

1599340,False,"After spending over 13,000 hours on this game, I have a lot to say but I'll try to focus on the most important points. The game has some good features, but sadly, it also has many problems.

Positives

The graphics are decent, and learning boss fights can be fun and exciting. Combat is interesting, with a good variety of challenges that require some skill.

The game also offers plenty of characters with unique abilities and really good looking animations. If you have a lot of free time 😉 and spend your gold wisely, most goals are possible without spending real money. Customizing characters with skins and presets is also enjoyable.

Negatives

Despite the developers' efforts, the game is still far from being newcomer-friendly due to extensive gatekeeping. There are numerous ways players are gated, including item level (ilvl), item quality, roster level, accessories, card sets, mechanics like transcendence, the new Ark Passive system, in-game titles, and an ever-growing number of systems that require massive gold investments.

New players often struggle to find others willing to teach them raid mechanics. Typically, their only real option is to buy a ""bus"" (a paid carry service), often from players who aren’t particularly skilled themselves. When things go wrong, these players usually blame the ""customer"" and in some cases, they don’t even refund the gold for a failed service.

Sure, you might make some profit by buying buses, but in the end, you’re left with next to nothing. Transitioning from T3 to T4 doesn’t really change much, you’ll still need to buy new accessories and new engraving books, farm new raids for couple months, and the game continues to introduce more ways to gatekeep new players.

If you want to play at a high level without spending real money, you’ll have to invest an enormous amount of time, playing six characters that also require gold investments to make a profit (don’t even think about making six different characters), bussing which is very easy, and dealing with countless people who aren’t suited for it, while still facing gatekeeping over trivial issues.

If for some reason you don’t want to buss, normal raids usually end up with jails caused by unskilled, ego top or delusional players.

Community & Game Experience

The community is toxic. Many players have inflated egos and little patience for others. Real money trading (RMT) is common, and people often use multiple accounts, destroying the game economy, which is already very bad.

Over time, the game becomes repetitive and exhausting especially raids after couple first clears. Daily tasks are like unpleasant chores. Unfortunately, the developers' new announcements don’t give much hope that this will ever change.",1739215975,820498.0,True,False,False,5,1,0.5244055390357971

1599340,False,"This game suffers a major struggle as one that is developed by a Korean development company and published by an American company who pushes the game updates from KR to the western version of the game. The publisher has no power or will to transform the new (or current) player experience in a meaningful, permanent way that will help them ascend to the relative power levels of veteran players.

One of the best examples: Gearing a character in this game requires collections of 'cards' for card sets which are a huge component of damage or support power for players. As such, it requires too much time commitment and/or money for new players to get to a point where they are comfortably playing endgame content with veteran players or normal consistent raid lobbies at all due to this huge missing chunk of damage or support power.

Due to the nature of raid leaders being able to inspect the full range of gear for applicants to raid lobbies, many players will be rejected because of their lack in raid power. Due to the difficulty and dps checks of some raids, the lower power players will have a hard time clearing raid content with each other at all even if they do make their own lobbies.

The developers did make content called 'solo raids' which can be completed for some of the relevant gear materials, but due to the content release schedule of the game, players are never quite able to catch up because their rate of growth is too slow.

By the time a newer player is ready to play a newer raid, most of the population will have moved on to a newer raid, and a fresh player will not have an easy time finding a raid group in the Lobby Finder that will help them learn an older raid. The older raids are referred to as 'homework', and players are often expected to already have played and farmed the raid enough by that time, so as not to hold back the players who want to complete this 'homework' raid for their needed gold.

Speaking of gold, the Western version of the game is suffering from very high economic inflation due to the rampant and seemingly unstoppable plague of gold farming bots. Korea doesn't suffer from this issue because their game client requires a Korean SSN to verify identity. Steam has no such requirements, so bot accounts can be made in mass volumes to this day.
It's against the terms of service for players to purchase gold from these bots, but they continue to do so and purchase (from the Auction House) either large volumes of honing materials or high value gear which also happens to be in high demand from the general population.

Lost Ark at its core was such a cool game and I'm happy to have played it since launch, but as of Feb2025 it's not hard to see that this game's publisher (Amazon Game Studios) and/or developers (Smilegate) continue to betray its audience at large by not acknowledging core issues at all or addressing them in a timely manner.

Unser menschliches Bedürfnis nach Verehrung, das früher Göttern, Heiligen oder Engeln galt, wird heute an Stars und Marken delegiert. Das Loch, vom ""Tod"" Gottes hinterlassen, wird gestopft. Ihr Reichtum und ihr Marktwert verleihen ihnen eine pseudogöttliche Aura – und die Werbung inszeniert diese Hierarchie unbewusst als „magischen Moment“. Nur in einer Gesellschaft, die Menschlichkeit konsequent zur Ware macht, kann die Begegnung mit einem Millionär wie ein Wunder wirken, das die selben Hirnregionen wie religiöse Katharsis stimuliert.

1599340,False,"On release, I quite loved this game. I enjoyed going through the storyline, the combat did (and still does) feel very fluid and amazing. Classes felt unique and questing didn't feel like a chore.
The downsides (HUGE downsides I might add) however are twofold;
1. It's a Korean MMO and so there are naturally extreme elements of P2W...can you play free? Absolutely! But you'll be MASSIVELY behind and time gated until you whip out that wallet. It feels like a job worth several days just to accomplish something equal to someone who spent $20.
2. This is an issue even bigger than the P2W/Monetization and it's THE biggest thing killing the game...but it's the Bots and website spammers in chat.
The level of Bots:Players ratio has to be 3:1 or 4:1 at this point if I had to guess and it's actively destroying this game. Either Smilegate doesn't care or Amazon doesn't care but as long as there are bots in this game, people will not want to play it, myself included. I don't know how Smilegate/Amazon plan on tackling this issue but its playerbase will continue to bleed in numbers until it's fixed for good. Their active player count is over-inflated by about 35-40% from accounts that aren't even real human players and that's truly sad to see for such a great game.

My only real gripe with the game is honing is the progression system and boy is it aggrivating, if you don't wanna spend money you gotta grind for a few days to attempt to hone an item. Oh it's like a 2% chance to upgrade? well pony up some cash or keep grinding. It sucks that f2p is so held back but I understand it's the play model they're choosing.

1599340,False,"I used to play this. A lot, as you can see from the playtime. Most of the time I spent in the game was in 2022-23. I had a good group of people I played with and the servers were full of great people. We didn't really know what we were getting into, however, and eventually we all started playing less and less. Mostly because we realized that this isn't really a game. It's a job that you can pay your employer for the privilege of playing. You either pay to skip the grind or you perform ridiculous amounts of fetch quests and spam the 'G' (interact) key. I'm not kidding when I'm saying there are things that you need to do hundreds to thousands and tens of thousand times. There is an 'island soul' that has a less than 1% chance to drop from a pouch that has a less than 1% chance to drop from a mob. I don't know what the math on that works out to exactly, but googling says in the thousands of hours.

Gear 'honing' has abysmal success rates and you lose materials on every attempt. The honing materials are tiered and each level requires a different material so all your old mats are virtually worthless when you move up a tier. Drop rates for 'collection' items are extremely low and many mobs, bosses, events, and/or islands only spawn once or twice a day/week, so collection can take hundreds of hours for a single item.

Every system in the game is designed to take as much time as possible, every single day, unless you pay. Even if you pay, the time gates and drop rates stay the same, so you still have to grind. Beyond the currency bloat, there are also 4+ XP systems you need to grind.

I stopped eventually because of the sheer grindiness and utterly ridiculous currency and loot box mechanics. I came back recently because I heard some of the newer updates reduced the grind and simplified the currency. I thought I'd take a look and see whether it was worth coming back to.

I should not have. The grind is all still there and, if anything, is worse. The currency has been simplified a bit but it is still ridiculous. There is still silver, gold, crystals, royal crystals, pirate coins, open seas coins, pheons, shards, fragments, and probably others that I've just forgotten. There are six different 'profession' currencies that you have to collect and each of them has multi tiered rarities. You can convert between all of these at awful (like 10 to 1) exchange rates. There are sinks for all of them everywhere.

Despite simplifying some things, they've added whole new systems to make things even more grindy and confusing. These systems have new fetch and farm quests and use different materials that you need to use that have low drop and conversion rates. It's just more of the same.

Trying to play content from before the endgame is hit or miss because people are simply not there and the content is not accessible by just one person. You can ask in chat and you might get lucky, but there is very little incentive for an end-game character to help out with content that they probably haven't touched in years. There is a 'solo' mode option for some pre-endgame content, which can be useful, but it's a little laughable having a 'solo' mode anything in an MMO.

I could try to find a guild and try out discord to get some older, wider content done, but that doesn't solve the grind and loot box issues this game has. I don't mind grinding for an item, but grinding for just a chance at an item is a special level of hell.

There are some nice people still playing and you might be able to connect with them in game or over discord and get some things done if you are new or returning, but if you value your time, money, and sanity, don't. Pick another MMO.",1737263259,70042.0,True,False,False,237,2,0.9278583526611328

Unfortunately the constant vertical grind isn’t worth it. Had the game stayed in Tier 3 I would have been content.

1599340,True,"I would say this game is an 7/10 overall. Worth trying, but not sticking around for because the end game content is awful, super grindy, and not satisfying.

The sound affects and visual affects are incredible, so satisfying. Its got an interesting story, with beautiful scenery that makes you feel very immersed in the universe as you progress through it.

One reason I remove 1 point from this game is that the character design is actually pretty bad. The gear and weapons can be cool but I don't know what's up with the two ""Specialist"" classes.. they are 10 year old girls with mini skirts and weird cutesy dresses which seems very out of place and borderline creepy. The faces on the characters you create generally look like something from a different game that doesn't match the aesthetic of this game. Everyone looks too clean, too pretty, in a game that is so destructive and gritty. They should make the characters more of a real and accurate match to the games design.

Another reason I remove 1 point is this game can take forever to launch and also can make your video card go insane. There could be some optimization improvements.

The last reason for the 1 point removal is once you reach max level its kind of boring to grind these solo dungeons and dailies to get higher end gear. It feels like the game fizzles away and you will get burned out fast. I actually stopped playing once I got to that point of the game because of that. Although you can continue the story line quests which I would recommend. I didn't do that before but now I'm revisiting to just only stick with the story line which is interesting. I would recommend to stop playing if you've experienced all the classes you like or are hitting end game grinds- its definitely not fun at that point. The PVE leveling experience/story is incredible though.

Overall, you should play this game. There are some insanely satisfying classes, check them out on their website and see which ones appeal to you the most because I promise at least 4 or 5 will blow you away with satisfaction. For me, the Sorceress & Summoner (Mage), Artillerist & Machinist (Gunner), as well as Slayer (Warrior), and Soul Eater (Assassin) classes are mind blowing with fun and non stop satisfaction.

I love that there is no lack of things to do.  When you feel a bit bored with one aspect of the game, you can do something else. There are so many options, and all of them are viable.  For example in most games being a completionist offers little more than self satisfaction, but in Lost Ark it actually rewards you with tangible rewards that matter. 

I do not love the necessity to do multi person raids where each boss has extensive wipe mechanics (what other games may make people face in an entire raid, they have people facing PER BOSS within the raid). It is exhausting. There is a ton of gate keeping.  And for people interested more in playing the story than being the biggest/baddest, it is grueling, and is the one reason I have to take extended breaks from the game.  They do sometimes offer events to help,  and power passes, however  many of those events bypass the story like you have already completed it, which is pointless for someone in it mostly for the story.  The solo raids were supposed to address this, but the wipe mechanics are still a huge issue for someone with coordination issues.  Locking gear progression behind what feels like impossible raids for someone with said coordination issues is my only complaint.",1732945800,76323.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

If you have friends it can be fun but the player treatment by the devs is the worst I've ever seen in a game. I stuck with it solely because of the cool people I met there, but staying relevant is a second job you don't want to get trapped in. Especially if you don't have the time to invest and are forced to fork over real money to help bridge the daily and weekly grinds or get the wrong side of the pervasive RNG rolls. Honestly though, the raids were interesting and enjoyable, but nearly every single thing I learned about how to play this game I learned from the internet or my friends. The in-game support for how to complete raid content is negligible at best, and lazy at worst.

The recent reviews being ""mixed"" are for a reason, and only the most recently impactful in a series of terrible player treatments.

1599340,False,"tl;dr: AGS as a publisher and the KR MMORPG grindy game doesn't respect your time. Play something else.

Lost Ark's best part is the challenging but fun raids. Some of them do requires you to respect patterns and adjust your movements + skill rotations around them.
Everything of the game is pretty much fubar. If you don't have decent active guild with players that played latest raids, you can find yourself in lobby waiting room simulation from time to time. Horizontal progressions take bloody amount of time.
Classic KR mmorpg have super grindy progressions that waste your time such as Elixirs/Transcendence clicking. Even with AI/calculators, it can still takes up hours to do them, with pure RNG.

3 weeks ago I got a temp ban because I exploited a simple Stronghold visiting trick that AGS/SG should've disabled easily in the first place. 1 month of temp ban would already put me behind the raiding curve for months. This is because I mainly played 1 character (my highest char is ilvl 1660), second highest at 1640, rest alts at 1620.
On 5th November, AGS found out their scripts didn't remove items properly on 2 weeks banned players that exploited the bug. Many of original 1 month banned players like me extended into perma-bans. REMINDER that AGS could've done rollbacks instead of this roundabout temp bans. 

The 7 sets of boxes I opened temporarily didn't even worth much, I used most of them on quality tapping. I told customer support to reconsider my perma-ban duration. But instead I received an automated bot message at 10:57 am after I typed up my appeal. (Basically no real life person actually looked into my appeal at all).

Founder buyer with 8.6k playtime, never chaos dungeon botted, never RMT'ed, never bussed in raids.

The good:

- it is a fun game with well made dungeons and bosses.
- badass villains and heroes and some well made cutscenes.
- a very well made soudntrack. Seriously, the Brelshaza's Phantom Alstagia boss song brings me a tear to my eyes everytime I listen to it.
- fluid and nice skill moves.
- a nice enough story. It's a cliche of good vs evil, but it's nice enough.
- a good amount of content to those aiming at collectibles.
- the skills of the characters are in general well made allowing nice combos and moves that generates the thrill of playing a Action RPG.
- the skins for characters are quite well made, and it's possible to farm those in game, without the need to put real money on the table.
- events in-game from time to time to level up a character, because leveling a character from scratch is a pain.

The bad:

- RNG on EVERY SINGLE PROGRESSION SYSTEM. Seriously, whoever design this has a serious gambling problem.
- a toxic player base that resembles a VX gas canister. *sigh* I mean it, they are like brats playing League of Legends and is one of the WORST aspects of this game.
- the game is made on Unreal Engine 3 and despite running well on most modern PCs, there's some tweaking with configs to achieve a good performance.
- game suffers from time to time from disconnects, mainly because of the anti-cheat system and the game takes ages to boot even on a SSD drive.
- on the topic about disconnects: got dced on the last minutes of a raid? Pray that you can log back in time, otherwise, the game will count it as ""complete"" but you don't get any reward. No Gold, no EXP, no Mats, no nothing. :(
- there are many other aspects that I found bad, but it'll make this review too long and there's plenty of those here on Steam already, so... yeah.

1599340,False,"The game felt actually fun in the beginning during Valtan-Akkan days. There were definitely issues despite this though, but it was way more bearable then the current state of Lost Ark. Lost Ark right now has some of the worst systems in mmos that I have ever experienced. Elixirs and Transcendence hold back the game to such a large degree, that it suck outs the fun, making me feel like not even wasting my time to play. These terrible progression systems on top of the awful gatekeeping that is present within the game really just makes the game feel like such a massive waste of time despite the combat being super enjoyable. 

I really do strongly believe that Ignite servers are a step in the right direction compared to most of these progression events that have been around for awhile. Ignite servers feel like how the game should be played for the Western version. However, despite this, the awful progression systems hold back this shining light of potential. They give a free 40 set of elixirs for playing on ignite servers, but the free 40 set is the luck set bonus (when you're dps you want critical or master set bonus, and for support you wants faith, luminary or advance). So you still need to cut at least your helmet and gloves, which isn't nearly as bad as current live servers starting from scratch, but it is still pretty bad because.. well the systems just suck so bad. Not only is it just awful rng but it is time consuming from actually playing the game. 

Honestly, solo raids are awesome, but it only goes up to ivory tower, and they nerfed the gold from Akkan solo recently (when it is bound gold which is absolutely harmless). I dunno why they continue to go down this path of speaking for mokokos (new players) and advertising for them, yet making the game super hostile to new & returning players.

The game is beautiful and trust me the game is very well made and designed, but it's all a lie disguised as free to play.

 Which will force you to spend thousands of hours trying to beat content on your own, and when you get to dungeons you'll be sitting on a bench waiting for people to join, just to be required to have top gear you might not have because ""you started playing this alone and have never geared up for 2k+ hours.""

 And now they updated the game with a Tier 4 which renders all your previous gear and items useless and priceless, hence affecting your resource value and account value.

After playing for two years, I reached a point where the endless grind became exhausting (I quit in June 2024). The introduction of Tier 4 felt like a missed opportunity for a fresh start, which could have brought new and returning players onto the same playing field. Unfortunately, it ended up being the same cycle, just with new materials and ""upgraded"" skills. I understand this is a Korean MMORPG, so grinding is expected, and the game constantly triggers FOMO. However, with the recent change in directors, I hoped Tier 4 would offer a meaningful reset, helping us move past the brutal Tier 3 grind.

The game was fun, but maintaining progress (with alts and farming gold) eventually became overwhelming.

If you didn't spend 30 minutes to study a guide before attempting a group raid, expect to never find willing players, be kicked, or have it end prematurely by the host. They are very salty about this and training lobbies were practically nonexistent. It didn't help said raids could be very punishing with party wipe mechanics in multiple phases.

That being said, I do recommend it. It's free to play and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

""Then it must be CS:GO?""

""No...""

""Marvel Rivals, right?"" She was very excited.

""No..."" I stared at the tip of my shoe, wishing I could burn a hole in the floor with my eyes.

 I pinched my thigh tightly, and squeezed out a mosquito-like tremor from my teeth: ""Neither... None!""

1599340,True,"Where do I even begin with this game. As a player that's been playing since launch I've been through the up and downs, the low lows and the high highs. From the whole Argos fiasco to the Brel fallout to the sudden AGS resurgence, I've been there. Do I recommend the game. Absolutely yes. I feel like the combat and raids in this game are pretty unmatched across the genre. If you are into fast-paced, high skill ceiling game play, where you can constantly see improvement in your play, its a great game.  

Now, I wouldn't call myself a hardcore player nor would I call myself a casual, but I am a veteran in this game. From my POV, the games great. I have people to play the latest and greatest content with and have a decent enough roster to get by through the current progression systems. For a new player though, I can see the struggles of what someone would go through. The constant gate keeping, toxicity, and reliance on DPS meter all make the game a pretty terrible experience for new players that want to play the latest raids. Not to mention the grueling recent progression systems that, albeit seeing some improvement, are still terrible for new players to get through. 

That's not to say the game is all bad for new players. There's a few pieces of advice I can give to new players:

First, Instead of trying to join people's parties, creating learning parties is something that not too many people do, but goes a long way to progressing through a raid. I recommend this to all new players. There will always be those too timid to create their own parties, so create one and see how many people are looking to learn. Who knows, it could be the start of some new friendships. 

Second,  take the game at your own pace. Its been out for 2 years, you are not catching up to day 1 veterans. I'm not saying this out of spite, its just the way the game is designed. Just take it slow and have fun. 

Third, I recommend checking out some starter guides on YouTube or some community websites such as Lost Ark Nexus, that can give you a good place to learn more about the game, classes, where to start, etc. 

If anyone reading this has more tips, feel free to comment so new players can see. I also want to add that as of 10/9/24 new ignite servers are coming to the game which heavily emphasize the new player experience and would be the perfect place for someone new to start. 

Well that's about it for my stream of consciousness. Hope I got my point across decently well. I really enjoy the game, and would love for some new people to experience what I have experienced the past couple years. Thanks!

1599340,False,"The game had a lot of potential, with the stunning and fluid combat, nice visuals and map designs for bosses, even tho it's running on an old engine, however the sad part is in 'Lost Ark' the Ark are players that are forced to quit on how the game progression is. Most player will hit the wall of pure exhaustion of the daily homework, massive frustration of clearing endgame content weekly or the unpolished and inhuman odds of upgrading equipment. 

The game itself is a streamline of daily to do list (checklist/homework) with weekly endgame content, and if you hop off a week or two to cool down and refresh, you will fall behind, especially if it's an update with a new endgame content. You can't recover without paying or using different variations to catch back up.

If you are interested and want to try it, I would recommend to start it with a event to help you get a point where you can try the entry content for endgame with solo raids and try out. 
A fair warning to whoever wants to join the endgame with all the veterans that are left or players that kept up with endgame, you won't be able to join as a F2P without paying/swiping for the equipment and unfortunately you will have a low roster(account) lvl.

If you seek out the community for joining in group/ guilds etc., don't sadly how the games progression is, it will be hard as new player to fit in or find some group.
Guilds are only made for extra materials weekly and most of the guilds will already have set groups for endgame content.
The community is mix bag of everything, but mostly strict with high expectations, most people would call it toxic, how the game is structured, endgame players set some expectations/criteria and most new players won't meet it or just get denied entry, however there are individuals that are willing to help if they have time, don't expect anything ( They aren't payed or obliged to teach you, it's their own good will to do so)

good things about the game are
- art is pretty good, some regions look very nice and they did recently update character models which some used to be really bad.
- the combats base is pretty good.
- the visual design of the bosses is cool.
- the raids for the most part are fun especially first time or blind.
- class designs are interesting

the bad things about the game
- Way too grindy and p2w (typical of a korean phone game which this is)
- ue3 limitations (causing many structural and small visual issues as well as performance problems)
- EAC
- complete reliance on high levels of cooperation in endgame raids (they did release solo raids which was a great thing, but it's limited to just old raids which sucks, and also is only easy mode so the rewards are kinda bad, this would be much better if they released a solo mode for everything including the challenging content like ""the first mode"")
- overly reliant on supports in endgame raids
- class balance is out of controll (it's fine if classes aren't perfectly balanced you can expect a 5-15% difference between classes in mmo's normally but the difference in this game between the bottom and top classes is about 50% dps output)
- extremely repetitive, daily and weeklies that are always the same and boring or annoying, even the raids start to get repetitive reusing bosses and mechanics of old raids over and over again.
- overly punishing raid design where 1 mistake leads to a reset makes it so you're incentivized to not take new players into a raid (you may see many posts about being gatekept this is the #1 reason why, it's more so the devs fault than the community though i understand blaming community too)

Over a dozen difference currencies to manage: Another grind factor to encourage pay to win

Awful travel system: Limited teleporters to different regions unless you pay the monthly sub. If you don't, you have to sail,

Such as when having to do a mechanic to stop a wipe, the boss will literally spam you with knockdowns, knock offs or even movement freezes which cover a large section of the arena. 

Sure you could roll to dodge, but than you have a long cooldown before you can dodge again, sure you could get back up but that cooldown is 30 seconds.

once you get to honing, it is pretty much gambling at the higher item levels, such as 5% or so to go higher. which by the way would not be so bad if the story content and new content outside of raids did not require you to get to those levels.

Even if my rating is 7/10 and I played since BETA, unfortunately, I can't recommend the game to new or returning players.

My objective is not to write an essay regarding all the game's problems and issues at present... To be as brief as possible, Lost Ark has simply been slowly getting worse over the years. It has become a part-time job for some reason.
Dailies are exhausting, player quality in late game raids is worse than ever, new gear progression mechanics are RNG inside RNG inside more RNG.

As a final note, if you still want to try out the game and enjoy it as much as you can, having a static is mandatory... Well, a good one; since with all the exhausting content in the game, having to deal with bad players will just make the experience worse.",1724890699,307119.0,True,False,False,5,0,0.5669553279876708

The BAD
Everything is top loaded, meaning its all focused on END GAME content. the cute mini-games and exploration is to get materials to help upgrade your gear that is only obtainable through either the toughest RAIDs or PvP rank matches. Like every Eastern MMO, upgrading has a chance to fail, you are rolling to see if your  gear goes from level 1-25 so you meet the requirements to enter a dungeon raid. 

There is no build diversity. There is only what is optimal and what gets you kicked from the raid. Thats why they have so many cosmetics to swipe your credit card. ( there actually very nice looking its subjective if its worth your hard earning money. The raids are very difficult, any member dying will lead to full party failure if you are  at the minimum requirements. The gimmicks in the raid have as few as 5 up to 20 different phases. Bosses can have just as many attack patterns. Each fight is timed 20mins before the enraged state where any mistake kills you. Death means you are spectating for the entire fight and the remaining people have to pick up your slack. Its not for new players, you need to do your research, learn and memorize the attack patterns, pay attention to positioning because you can get other people killed for your bad playing. Costing everyone's time and then you get kicked. Then gate kept for never clearing raids which then leads to many players dropping the game because the only way to get clears is to spend your hard earned currencies ( or real money) to pay for an experienced high level player to bus you through it. 

Is it fun, yeah kind of. As much fun as seeing a failure screen notification and relying on 7 other random people to know what they are doing at all times. So either make a lot of friend who are good, find a good guild that will talk to you or avoid this game.

1599340,True,"I'm going to give the game another chance. I'm pretty much on break from everything else, so I'm going to sit down and really give it a chance and see where it goes... I love MMOs, but these modern games really normally don't elicit much reaction from me, but we'll give it a go. You have the artist now with your 2023 Spring update, so I'm going to roll the artist version of artist, so going heals. I like to heal in these games, so I hope I enjoy it, because I need a new game to master, and healing is my thing in these games, so I'm hoping the artist has some cool abilities and the group aspect of the game is cool--after chewing through the wall, but we'll see... From what I've read, and I never made it very far into this game before quitting, but I've been on the fence with this one, but from what I've read, the group aspect of the game has been tarnished, and that's a disappointment for me personally, but I'll see what is going on here for myself. I like to play in a group for the hard content as a healer, and I'm a veteran healer, so that aspect of the game has to be there, or I'm disappointed. If I roll heals and have to solo through all the content I'm going to be disappointed, and I'm an artist, so I'm a writer, so I'll play artist. I'm a novelist, but I'll check your game out to see if it stands the test of time. Healers have a performance. If there are no groups, or groups are too hard to join, or the content is so open that groups don't matter, then I can't do my performance and it's just another solo game, and an MMO at that, and that's not a good thing. If your healer sucks, or healing in the game sucks, then I'll be able to tell. I'm really good at detecting failure. Healing in EverQuest was pretty much the best system around, but these modern games want to change everything up, but we'll see. Action MMOs normally water down the healing system quite a lot, but it could be fun too, so we'll see. I'm not against combat healing, if it's done properly. If someone could just make a fun healing game, that'd suffice. Healing in most of these games suck, and being dps sucks, and being tank sucks, so please for the love of all that I enjoy, please have a great healer. I don't know. Maybe I'll play later. Once a week on the raiding content and running a bunch of alts doesn't sound like my cup of tea, but I might play at some point, but I'm still not sure, even after downloading the game... An eighty-five million dollar game, huh? Let me see what this is like on the artist. Jumping around, huh? I dunno... sounds complicated enough though, but not sure it's my style. I'm god on heals, and your game is a modern healer, so let's give it a spin... I'm a twenty plus year MMO living legend.

You've granted me a event pass and all of that, so I'm using it, and I don't normally use these sorts of things, but I will to test your product, but the game is fine, but it's an action MMO, and these sorts of games really aren't appealing to a long standing MMO player like myself. We want an eighty-five million dollar EverQuest. From what I'm seeing here, the game isn't bad, and I haven't played in groups yet, but I'll check it out, but action MMOs aren't where the genre started, and we want the old game back. All there has been is action MMOs ever since the passing of the great EverQuest, and they've even toned that game down quite a bit, so it's dead now. Casual MMOs aren't my cup of tea, but I'll check your game out. Most of the MMOs that have been on the market since EverQuest have been such a waste of time and talent. The original EQ was more like a simulator, and these action MMOs are more like a action racecar than the original simulation of a racecar, and I'd like to see the original format brought back, just with more depth and more interesting mechanics and graphics. The old EverQuest was the best simulated reality you could get, and sadly, it's over and all we've had since are these soft-core action MMOs. If you look at racecar games, some people prefer an action racecar game, and that's me, but some people prefer the simulated games too, and that's me too, so I like both, but MMOs are the same way, but I'd prefer to have a simulated reality in MMOs compared to the action oriented scene of the modern era. Redefine gaming and create a modern simulated reality. That's what defines MMO in my opinion, not an action oriented reality. It's like my comparison to action verses simulation in racecar games and this is action in MMO gaming. Where is the simulator? I want the simulator. It's 2024 and it needs to be done, and done properly, like you've done with action MMO gaming, but now you need a simulated reality... I'm waiting... All game developers are chasing the action rabbit down the hole and it's been going on for far too long. A simulated reality lurks within the darkness... Compare it to the second Elder Scrolls in the series: The Elder Scrolls Daggerfall compared to what we get now.

1599340,False,"Lost Ark dazzles with its stunning visuals and engaging combat, featuring fast-paced fights and a variety of exciting classes. However, its deeper flaws quickly overshadow the enjoyment it tries to offer. The game often feels like a second job; if you’re not constantly grinding, you fall behind. It aggressively pushes you to spend money to bypass the grind, making progress feel tied to how much you're willing to pay. The gearing system adds to the frustration, relying heavily on random luck and turning upgrades into a gamble rather than a reward. One of the biggest letdowns is how the game seems designed to cater to big spenders, or ""whales,"" while delivering a subpar experience to those who only want to spend a reasonable amount. It’s disheartening when the focus is on profiting from high spenders rather than offering a fair experience for everyone. The community is another major hurdle. Older content, which isn't part of the current progression, is often inaccessible. Many of these raids need a full 8-player party, and with few people queuing for them, you might find it nearly impossible to experience or complete them. This lack of access is especially frustrating for those who want to explore all the game has to offer. Plus, the game’s focus on specific builds and numerous buffs means that if you’re not using the popular setups, you’re often left out. While the boss design in Lost Ark is excellent, with challenging and rewarding mechanics, the major flaw is that being unable to access this content due to the issues mentioned undermines the game’s strengths. The frustrating design, where you can get “jailed” or locked out of progression, makes it hard to enjoy the game and feels like a penalty for simply trying to play and have fun. I understand that being free-to-play means the game is more accessible to casual players and needs some form of monetization. Yet, I believe this aggressive model will ultimately drive the game to its end, as it alienates many players and pushes them away. The game clearly has a lot of love put into it, but very aggressive and non-consumer-friendly practices prevent many players from fully enjoying it. This situation seems to push developers toward even more aggressive tactics to keep the game afloat, which only further alienates its player base. Overall, I had fun with the main story and some of the earlier legion fights, but the frustrating gearing experience has made me quit the game three times now, and I believe this time it’s for good.",1723424111,16029.0,True,False,False,30,0,0.6821403503417968

I have almost 3000 hours played in this game. Lost Ark easily has one of the best combat systems in any top-down RPG that's out there. It also has boss design that rivals other MMOs like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14. But one of the biggest problems the game suffered with since released was the gatekeeping that exists in the Party Finder for raids. It was almost impossible for new players to get accepted into groups in order to experience the main appeal of this game, which is raiding. This is why even though I absolutely love this game, I never recommended it to other people because I knew it would be a miserable experience for any new player.

One week ago, Lost Ark introduced Solo Raids into the game. This mode introduced an option that allows the majority of boss fights in the game to no longer require a group to enter, and is tuned to be achievable with a  single player. In my option, this mode has saved the game.

Solo Raids are almost identical to the group version of these raids, and they all provide an actual challenge when done at the appropriate Gear Level. I strongly recommend giving Lost Ark a try if you are a person that loves MMO raid content and are interested in the challenge of taking on epic boss fights on your own.",1721862048,170187.0,True,False,False,45,2,0.776863694190979

1599340,True,"Después de unas cuantas sesiones dentro del mundo de Lost Ark y tras haber mirado un sinfín de vídeos y foros de gente hablando del juego, estoy listo para dar mi opinión personal.

Lost Ark es un juego desarrollado en Korea por SmileGate Studios y porteado a Occidente por Amazon Games Studios. El juego se ambienta en el mundo de Arkesia, con la típica historia del elegido (El jugador) Buscando los 6 Arcas, no voy a decir más por spoiler y porque todavía no terminé por completo la ""campaña"".

El estilo artístico recuerda al de los ARPGS con la cámara desde arriba pero el apartado visual es para mí de los mejores, teniendo una gran variedad de continentes cada uno con sus respectivos ambientes y diseños únicos que aportan al apartado visual que hace este juego placentero a la vista y variado sin que se haga repetitivo.

El combate es el punto más fuerte sin dudarlo, teniendo bastantes clases y subclases para elegir (Y algunas que no he visto en otros MMORPGS personalmente) Y siendo extremadamente placentero matar bichos a diestro y siniestro sin parar, la personalización de personajes está bien, ni excelente, ni mal, pero es suficiente para quedarse uno satisfecho.

Las misiones del juego son las típicas de ""recoge este objeto y tráelo"" o ""mata 10 bichos en esta zona"", se pueden hacer repetitivas y llega un punto que puede cansar hacer esto zona por zona durante decenas de horas.

En general, el juego es muy completo y, a día de hoy (Lunes 22 de julio de 2024) Tiene una media de 30.000 jugadores en Steam, que no está nada mal. Ahora iré a los puntos más IMPORTANTES del juego y los más polémicos.

El EndGame es gigantesco, teniendo un sinfín de posibilidades para jugar y, por fortuna, han metido la posibilidad de hacer la mayoría de éste de manera solitaria, eliminando el ""GateKeeping"" del juego en su mayoría, el problema de las raids y mazmorras solo son que dan muy pocas recompensas comparado con las versiones normales, siendo más que nada una ""práctica"" sin que nadie meta presión por fallar una mecánica, porque las raids de este juego son de las más difíciles que he visto en un MMO, haciendo que cada minúsculo fallo castigue a todo el equipo haciendo que mueran todos tus compañeros y reiniciando el encuentro (De allí a toda la toxicidad en referencia a las raids y el GateKeeping).

El farmeo de este juego es bastante tedioso, especialmente porque si quieres estar a la altura del contenido más reciente a la salida, tienes que tener personajes secundarios (Alts) Y farmear diariamente con todos, haciendo que el juego se convierta en un ""segundo trabajo"" motivo por el que mucha gente se queja, es posible jugar con un solo personaje y, espero que esto no desincentive a la gente de probar el juego porque todo el contenido que ofrece se puede jugar de manera gratuíta, y aquí voy al tercer y más importante punto que ha alejado a la mayoría de la gente. La MONETIZACIÓN.

El sistema de ""microtransacciones"" si se le puede llamar así, es bastante agresivo, recompensando a las personas que se conecten y jueguen de manera diaria, pero lo peor está en la tienda, que a parte de tener una interfaz bastante poco intuitiva, está llena de materiales y boosts para comprar que dará una obvia ventaja a quien pase la tarjeta de crédito que a quien no, es cierto que el juego no lo llamaría Pay to Win porque ninguna progresión está bloqueada directamente detrás de un pago, pero sí que proporciona ventajas inmensas a las personas que pagan, y para subir de nivel de personaje cada vez se hará más difícil hacerlo sin pasar por caja...

Lo último que he de decir que es otro punto bastante negativo es la cantidad de sistemas que el juego tiene, es extremadamente abrumador ser presentado con una montaña de mecánicas de subida de nivel, haciendo que cada jugador nuevo se eche para atrás al ver todo este bodrio de interfaces (Y sé que tiene un tutorial y se agradece, pero de igual manera son demasiadas cosas que aprender y sistemas junto con mecánicas, haciendo que cuando no te lleven de la mano junto con la historia, no sepas que hacer).

Honestamente, el juego no está bien, y de hecho, solo lleva decayendo en número de jugadores desde la salida, no es muy alentador que se diga y me da mucha pena porque aún así seguiré jugándolo de manera casual porque detrás de todos los problemas que tiene, Lost Ark es para mí, de los mejores MMO del mercado actualmente...

1599340,False,"I'll put it bluntly: Don't play this game, its a complete waste of your time.


Lost Ark literally excels at NOTHING compared to any other MMO in the market, here's why: 

1. The combat is pretty good, but if you want to play for combat, go play BDO

2. Raids are super inconsistent with how good their designs are, a lot of the bosses are trash riddled with personal responsibility or rng mechanics that can just screw you no matter how good you are (Genuinely not a skill issue, its a design flaw) Cinematically they usually always deliver tho, so i'll give them credit where its due.

3. Story is pretty average however sadly you don't get to play the story because you just skip to tier 3 (aka skipping around 75% of the games lore, nice!) unironically the best part of the game was how the questing flowed, you picked up a bunch of sidequests and they all  conveyed around the MSQ area making it fast but fulfilling (But nowadays you just skip it all lol)

4. Complete trash p2w game that basically forces you to swipe hundreds if not thousands of dollars to catch up to your friends(Even BDO a game that's infamous for its p2w is nowhere as bad as this game lmao) and even then if you ever quit once, you are behind PERMANENTLY even if you swiped 1000 dollars, what a joke dude. (If you don't swipe it will take at least 3 months to reach current content even WITH hyper expresses etc).

5. If my above point wasn't enough, the game is filled with terrible rng systems and other collectibles that can take you over a year aka cards (aka Light Of Salvation 30) if you don't have this you instantly get gatekept from 90% of raids because there's no other way to identify player skill in the game outside of ''oh does this guy have these cards, did he spend 10k hours in the game? OK you're in'' (Titles don't mean jack either because you can just buy a bus and get the title, and btw bussing shouldn't exist either but they don't care!)  (And no, solo raids wont solve the gatekeeping issue because current content will ALWAYS require other players to clear)

6. Graphics are OK considering its on UE3, however its starting to show its age AND the game is terribly optimised, I have a friend running a high end setup (myself included) and sometimes in the game we have consistent 20 fps or straight up freezes my entire monitor for a minute.

7. Developers don't seem to have great community interaction + management on bots that will gradually come back every couple of months because they refuse to add a verification system of some sort to prevent botting, which leads to the economy of the game being terrible, I've seen someone being racist in chat before and I reported him and basically never got a response / word that this person has been banned so I guess we just have a racist running around, all good!

8. Final point that I can think of for the time being and the most glaring one is that this games community is completely dogwater (if you have a static (aka premade with friends) then go for it) id rather interact with league of legends players on a daily basis, the games culture is terrible and everyone is out here trying to speedrun their raids and if someone fails or if you fail i would say in a pug almost 60% of the time you'll have some guy trying to flame you despite trying to be completely honest on what mechanic you messed up on (Seriously guys, trust me on this).

(I decided not to split this into pros and cons because to be honest everything in this game has something wrong that you can argue about)

TL;DR: Don't play this game its a waste of time filled with rng annoyances and gatekeeping issues & also p2w with a pretty bad community, if you want to play an mmo for the combat, play BDO. If you want to play for group content / well designed systems / social interaction > go play WoW or FFXIV  :)",1721333864,144410.0,True,False,False,6,0,0.5575675964355468
1599340,False,"I realy REALY want to love this game. It has everything i want in an mmo.
Amazing fealing Combat, stunning Dungeons, epic Raids, a Butt load of side content to do, an economy, but there are just a few things that just make this game Unplayable in the long run.
1. Pheons are a system in the game to prevent item flipping in the Player Econemy, you need them in every Item tranaction thet involves Gear for your character. The problem is that you only get verry few of them in Events or you pay $$$. no other way.
2. The game has an absurd bot problem. at one point there where an estemated 3x the amount of bots than player, wich you can verry easly read out of the player statistic on SteamDB. this Ruins the emersion when 30 identical character stand in the exact spot and run around farming mats to ruin the Player Econemy.
3. Gatekeeping, if you don't have BiS gear or god forbit, don't know the mechanics of a raid by heart you will have a VERY hard time queueing into a raid.
4. and probably for me the worst. playing this game feels like a second job with the amount of Dailys they put onto you. You have to do 3x a short quest somewhere on the map, 2x Chaos dungeon (wich are a 5 min Mob slaughter feest) and 1 Guardian raid (wich basicaly a Monster hunter boss). They are accualy prity fun for the first like 2 weeks but to be the most efficient you have to do them with 6 characters and do them every day FOREVER. this is just to much work. I don't have time to play other games because the only thing i do all day is doing my Dailys. Maby it is beter if you already are equipt with Top Gear but i'm not doig that anymore.

RAIDS:
You definitely need to watch tutorials, learn mechanics, have a very quick understand and stay on top, I used to know them all but not playing for maybe 6 months and BAM its all gone - but NO PROBLEM, because nobody will accept me into their damn group anyway.

1599340,False,"lost ark has amazing combat and there is nothing else like it out there. However, it's community is toxic through and through. They are highly committed to gate-keeping so they can continue to get weekly content done in the endgame fast and efficiently. A lot of them seem to blame developer shortcomings(even though it is a publisher issue) for the tragedy of its shrinking community but they will not let you in raids unless you are in a static or have outrageously gear/ lvled characters.
 Sometimes they like to lock you out of raids based on if you have this card set, LOS 30. In order to get this card set, you need to first have 6 legendary cards. Then you need to get 15 duplicates of each card so you can ""awaken"" them to the next level. The game itself may help you with a few a long the way, but the rest is up to grinding a TON of hours. 
Sometimes they'll gate keep based on a secondary leveling system called ""roster lvl"" which essentially represents the time you have spent on this game. If that wasn't enough for you, wait till you hear about the honing system. 
In my own experience, returning after a 6 month break has caused me to be unable to find anyone to learn raids(partly because no new players can be introduced into the game because of the ban issue)  clear endgame content without paying gold to get carried by the gatekeepers.

1599340,False,"The Future of Gaming: Developing Video Games Specifically for Bots

The world of video games has traditionally been centered around human players. However, a fascinating shift is emerging in the gaming industry—developing video games specifically for bots to play. This evolution presents a myriad of opportunities, not only for the advancement of technology but also for the enrichment of various fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and digital entertainment. Here are several compelling reasons why creating games for bots should be pursued.

One of the primary reasons to develop video games for bots is to drive the advancement of AI. Games provide complex, dynamic environments that are ideal for training AI systems. Unlike traditional AI training grounds, video games offer a rich tapestry of scenarios and challenges that can help improve problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and decision-making skills in bots.

For instance, games like StarCraft II and Dota 2 have already been used to train sophisticated AI models. By creating games specifically designed for bots, developers can tailor environments to push the boundaries of AI learning, fostering innovations that can be transferred to real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial modeling.

Video games for bots can serve as robust testing grounds for new algorithms and AI behaviors. In controlled virtual environments, developers can simulate countless scenarios quickly and efficiently, observing how AI agents respond to various challenges without the ethical and practical limitations present in real-world testing.

These bot-focused games can include specific parameters and metrics to evaluate AI performance, providing clear benchmarks for improvement. This controlled setting allows researchers to iterate rapidly, fine-tuning their models with a precision that is often unattainable in more chaotic real-world environments.

Developing games for bots opens new horizons in game design and mechanics. Traditional game design is often constrained by human limitations such as reaction times and cognitive load. However, when designing for bots, developers can explore new mechanics that leverage the speed, precision, and multitasking capabilities of AI.

This paradigm shift can lead to the creation of entirely new genres of games that are more complex and intricate than those made for human players. These games can serve as a playground for exploring advanced AI strategies, cooperative behaviors, and competitive interactions at a scale and sophistication level that human-centric games cannot achieve.

Bot-centric video games can also become powerful educational and training tools. By simulating complex environments and scenarios, these games can be used to train AI in specific tasks, such as disaster response, urban planning, and resource management. Educational institutions and corporations can use these simulations to teach AI systems how to handle specific challenges and optimize their performance.

Additionally, these games can serve as educational platforms for students and researchers in the field of AI and machine learning. They provide hands-on experience in designing, testing, and improving AI models in a controlled, gamified setting, making learning more engaging and effective.

Training AI in virtual environments alleviates many ethical and safety concerns associated with real-world testing. For example, self-driving cars or drones can be trained in simulated worlds where mistakes do not result in real-world consequences. This ensures that by the time these AI systems are deployed in the real world, they have been rigorously tested and refined in a risk-free environment.

Bot-focused video games provide a safe space for AI to make and learn from mistakes, improving their performance and reliability without posing any danger to humans. This approach not only enhances the safety of AI systems but also accelerates the development process by allowing for rapid iteration and testing.

Lastly, developing games for bots can expand the frontiers of digital entertainment. As AI continues to evolve, we could witness the emergence of fully autonomous, AI-driven esports leagues, where bots compete against each other in high-stakes tournaments. These events could attract spectators, much like traditional esports, offering a new form of entertainment that blends gaming, technology, and sports.

Moreover, bot-centric games can generate vast amounts of data and insights into AI behavior, which can be fascinating to study and analyze. This data can fuel further advancements in AI and provide entertainment in the form of watching highly skilled AI agents engage in complex strategies and tactics.

The development of video games specifically for bots to play is a promising frontier that can significantly impact the fields of artificial intelligence, game design, education, and entertainment. By leveraging the unique capabilities of AI, these games can drive technological advancements, provide robust testing environments, create new game mechanics, and offer safe and ethical training grounds. As the technology continues to evolve, the potential benefits of bot-focused games will only grow, heralding a new era in the intersection of gaming and AI.",1717604165,2312.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5

1599340,False,"So, how do I begin. I'll start by saying throughout my time playing this game I've almost always had people to play with that I met online or knew from previous games. Anyways, this game has gone pretty far downhill for me. Graphics are meh cause it is built in fkin UE3. The pros are pretty cool. Really pretty skins *wink wink*. You can dress your character up, or dress em down. Amazing combat. But... there's always a but and here it is. The game has innate flaws that are very apparent for an average player. I've swiped probably 2000-3000. Maybe less. Most of that went to skins lol. But even with that you feel so constrained. I have a pretty decent roster. 1630 main, 2 1620s, 2 1610s and 1 lowly 1600. I've gotten pretty lucky too, but also had some horrible luck. That's just the game, right? Well, kind of, yeah. But then because of all it's design flaws and innate flaws within, you can easily g2g w/e the fk you want. You might get banned, you might not. EVEN IF YOU GET BANNED, you can literally just come back 3 days later and work up the gold or even g2g back to positive gold.

I've been playing since, pretty much, day 1. I still feel behind because some people are luckier and some just swipe and some just g2g. You see hundreds of videos talking about this game and you come to download it. I, honestly recommend, don't. You WILL feel left behind. You WILL get gatekept. You WILL just feel the same way I've felt for about a month. Depressed. I enjoyed the game. I loved meeting people. I'm in active guilds. It's fun. But, you just feel so secluded without any of that. And for an MMO, there's a lot of non MMO like things. There's a playerbase composed of thousands of bots. Most of the playerbase probably dislikes playing the game. For god's sake there's a blacklist in multiple guilds of people that fk up in raids and are just bad at the game. I've done it. I've blacklisted people who have fked up multiple times in a gate of a raid. I'm guilty, but that's what the game entails. EVERYTHING IN THE GAME REQUIRES YOU TO JUST BE NEAR PERFECT IN RAIDS. You fk up once, gg. Now back to what I said in the way beginning. I've had people to play with most of the times. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. Get people to play with. HAVE FUN. Play with a guild. Play with friends. Enjoy the game. 

Fomo is real. For those that don't know what that is, it's fear of missing out. FOMO. The second you realize you're fomoing, you're already stuck in a loop. You want that +25. You want to get 10 reclears so you can JUST GET INTO A FKIN LOBBY for god's sake. Please. I love the game, love the combat. But there are so many things within the game that make it so frustrating to fall behind or just quit and come back.

There's a lot of reviews that are from people like me, i.e. thousands of hours played, that are negative. It's because we enjoyed the game. We liked the combat. I liked the communities I surrounded myself with, but the game is just deadly. It's a trap. It is. Highly recommend, if you read reviews for some reason and finished this one and wanna see a different one with more in depth shit. I read Leonox's review.

1599340,False,"I played this game for a long time. Prior to the Thaemine patch, I enjoyed playing this game. However, ever since the Thaemine patch dropped, I won't recommend this game anymore.

To be honest, the game always has the same problems that the devs never really fully addressed. It's pay to win, infested with bots, not casual friendly with a lot of gate keeping. It's impossible to keep up unless you swipe a ton, grind a ton, and you're forced to make friends so you can have a consistent group to raid with. This game is extremely raid focused, and the raids are designed to be very punishing and time consuming, which is why people gate keep pugs. With pugs, you may run into people who are so bad at playing and they jail you, which means you're saying goodbye to your weekly rewards. Or you may run into toxic elitist pugs that flame and kick you for one mistake. All these factors go back to my earlier point, that this game is not casual friendly and you're forced to make friends.

Since I really enjoyed the graphics, character looks, combat and raid cinematic, I was willing to put up with all the negatives above for a really long time. I swiped a ton, played a ton, made sure I learn new raids the week it released because people started doing achievements and title gate keeps in week two. I joined multiple discord communities and made sure I have statics for the harder contents. Played multiple supports at end game since there's a support shortage at end game. And it was fine until the Thaemine patch dropped.

So prior to the Thaemine patch, a lot of players quit during Brelshaza release due to how difficult that raid was. Gatekeeping was at an all time high and it broke apart a lot of statics. But I survived that. However, this time, Thaemine is worse and here's why. With Brelshaza, if you didn't complete gate 5-6, that's fine because you still earn the same materials required for vertical progression, just at a slower rate. But with Thaemine, hard mode gate 3 is required for vertical progression. You cannot unlock full transcendence unless you've completed hard mode gate 3. And no, I'm not complaining because I didn't get it. I did. My main cleared hard mode gate 3 with some sweaty friends and it still doesn't change how bad this entire system is. I'm running my alt with my other friends who didn't clear hard mode gate 3, and the struggle is too real. The raid is simply too hard. They can put hard content out as an optional challenge for sweaty players, but they should never lock progression behind hard mode. It feels so demoralizing to be in hours and hours of jail, after a long day at work. Most players (me included) just want to have fun and relax, and right now, Thaemine is not helping.

As a result of Thaemine jail, I've witnessed a lot of broken friendships and broken statics in the community. People are forced to choose between maintaining friendships vs progressing ahead of friends who don't pick up the mechs as fast. It's too much drama. All of that on top of the expensive gold sink with transcendence and elixirs. KR has the same gold sinks but they had much longer time to grind, vs our version it's expedited in terms of timeline but gold sinks remained the same!? I can't anymore. I'm still playing for now because the game is not friendly for returning players and I'd never want to be in that position, but I don't know how much longer I can last before I do decide to quit permanently. Hopefully the devs can fix the game soon before that.",1716504548,462777.0,True,False,False,213,10,0.8980491161346436
1599340,False,"This game is amazing, and yet terrible for many reasons.  While the story is more miss than hit, most of the playbase skips the story and harasses those who do not skip the cutscenes.  Beyond this...here are the juicy pros and cons:

Pro - The gameplay is very fun and very kinetic.  Classes are/were being added all the time, and each is quite different with different builds.  When you fight raid bosses or even mobs, there is a lot of variety with each being really fun and rewarding.  The combat is very reactive focused, and it feels amazing.  Additionally, each new continent (for the most part) has unique and varied.  It really is quite stunning.

Cons - This game has tons of progression systems that not just rewards, but incentives you to treat it as a job.  You can earn gold (the only way to progress) on 6 characters for 3 raids a week, and it takes a lot of time unless you go with groups.  It is even referred to as homework.  Even then, all it takes is one person using third party tools (whether by piloting the raid or telling someone else in your party they suck) to explode everything, get ""jailed"" and stuck, and completely waste your time.  Beyond that, there are so many different progression systems tied into how your character performs (random card spawns for sets to increase damage, gems to increase skill damage, book collections by random drop to fill, etc etc etc) that it makes new players joining, and those who have been highly unlucky, second class citizens in an already niche game.  AGS is tied to the decisions the main developers have for the game, and thus we already know what is going to be happening.  And it sucks.

I love the gameplay so much, but it should not be on the community solely to help new players get used to the game that is poorly communicated.  Let alone it is almost impossible for new players to progress because no one will accept them in raids, it makes those who try and help others feel terrible because there is only so much time.  While the gameplay is great, and AGS has been really good on communication, there is only so much that can be done when it is out of their control.  A game shouldn't become a job, and yet Lost Ark really wants you to embrace it as a full time employee...and never stop giving.

As of right now, Smilegate ( the developer ) is on the right track finally realising and fixing those funtamental problems plagueing Lost Ark. Tier 4 Release had similar big issues as i was writing my previous Review. Those have been mostly addressed and steps are being taken on atleast first mitigating and then fixing it.

But still, its a Free2Play Game. I advice to not buy any material packages until you really know its ingame value. There is Grind and there is Tediousness to sell you the convinience.

Still playing the game regardless of me giving a negative review. But i still want to give my impression of it regardless. I've hit 1630 on my Paladin recently and i'm about to ""dial it down"".

Review:

if you intend on playing the game, please do not purchase anything in this game. The amount of negligence smilegate/amazon is showing is not worth investing any funds into.

Rampand botting, RMT'ing, Cheating. Only lackluster ""we are looking into it"" response every couple of months.

New Player experience absolutely horrendous. If you want to play with other people, be prepared to grind 2-3 Months just do be somewhat ""presentable"" for the lobbies that are open. No amount of ""just open your own group"" or ""just join a learning party"" will help you here. I've recently created a completely new roster on another server and the situation is bleak to say the least. it is no wonder, that smilegate talked about introducing solo raiding content.

i can scream into the void longer and write an essay on why this game could be good or how to fix it, but mega-cooperation amazon/smilegate only is listening when people are not spending money / leaving.",1715531385,671271.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5335928201675415

1599340,True,"I enjoy it. It's a fun game. I've played since day 0.

[h3]Main points and nitpicks:[/h3]

- I would recommend this game IF AND ONLY IF you either have friends who play, are willing to find a group to play with consistently, are willing to join learning parties, are willing to progress at a slowish pace until you get more experience and have the means to show for it (roster level, boss clear titles, etc.)

- The game is innately gatekeepy because of the amount of raids that people want to get done per week. Nobody wants to take longer than necessary to complete raids that can be done in less than 2 tries as they probably have more raids to finish afterwards. This leads to people preventing low level or inexperienced players from getting into said raids, further preventing them from progressing. There will also always be someone stronger that applies that people would rather accept into their parties over you. If you are going to try to raid as a low level player, you need to make your own group and accept people with a similar account level (roster level) as yours. Or you have to find/make a static group instead. Also good gear quality and builds will help a lot on not getting gatekept.

- Progression system is a hit or miss to be honest. You are guaranteed to tier up your gear eventually after X amount of attempts per piece. This is basically a pity system. [b]Further on in the game however[/b], there appears more progression systems to further enhance your gear. Some of these systems are absolute garbage (looking at you elixers, bracelets, and stonecutting). The RNG on these systems are godawful especially since they have so many trash options that can absolutely wreck your chances at getting a good or even usable upgrade. I've spent waaaaaay too much time and resources on some of these god awful systems while some of my friends have been stuck waiting for me to progress because of that.

- Most MMORPGs that I've played have you constantly grinding. In Lost Ark, I don't have that urge or need to constantly grind as the game doesn't force you to play every day. If you skip a day, you can gain a rest bonus for daily content and receive the rewards the next day. This rest bonus does hit a max and will stop growing after a few days though. The daily login reward bonus calendar isn't for EVERY day of the month so you can miss a few days here and there as well. Personally, I don't even use my entire rest bonus and don't even do a lot of daily content. You can even ""dispatch"" some daily content and get a little bit less rewards by just letting it autocomplete over a few hours (even when offline).

[h3]Other points[/h3]
- It's free to play and can be played completely free to play. I highly suggest at least buying Crystalline Aura, with in-game currency or with real money if you can afford it. You can easily support your Crystalline Aura subscription with in-game currency made from raiding or selling stuff on the auction house.
- The gameplay is fun.
- The story is somewhat interesting (you can always just skip the dialogue and speed through it if that's not your jam.
- There's a fair amount of horizontal content as well (stuff besides raiding).
- This is definitely a PvE only game, PvP is more or less non-existant except for a few people here and there who still do it.
- The game is receiving updates.
- The community is very alive
- The anticheat, EAC, is pretty bad to be honest. It makes the game take 50 years to load and will crash you out on the dumbest of this.
- Lots of bots at low levels :\
     - They infect the economy pretty hard. Whenever there are bot banwaves, you can see the price of materials fluctuate (fish go brr)

There is no free to play game. You spend your time to get enjoyment and money most of the times. Lost Ark pushes you to spend through it's ridiculously low chance taps to upgrade your gear or you are gated from end game. You can do it theoreticaly as free player but you need enormous grinding time with alts, which is tedious and boring. You can easily lose lots of real money buying mats for low chance taps and stay weeks behind other's If you are unlucky.
The community of end-gamers when i quited was already gatekeeping people If they didn't have the meta decks, gear numbers etc.
 I started the game at launch and all my time was without a pause until I quited because of the ridiculous gambling progression system and because i didn't have the time to farm or the will to gamble. 
Graphics and gameplay are very good but, would you play a game if you knew that in the end game you would have to farm or spend real money or face a wall of no progression?

1599340,True,"Positives:

Raids are fucking fun. Like honestly the best combat system hands down of any other MMORPG out there. I've played quite a few too. I would say it rivals BNS but it's hard to compare since it's 2 different styles.

Graphics are pretty - while not nuking ur GPU.


Negatives:

Progression systems. Not much to say here. dogshit Korean mmo progression systems and Smilegate is stupid and greedy. Like honestly I think AGS is doing their best to make it less bad for the west, but.. ultimately nothing much when the progression is just fundamentally bad and tied to RNG.

Recently they heavily reworked two of the worst offenders at least (elixirs and transcendence). But honing needs less RNG variance still imo. There is a pity but the difference between 1 tapping and pity is HUGE. And the frustration of pitying a piece far outweighs the joy of 1 tapping.

Gatekeeping. The raids mechanics are way too punishing for newer players, and at some point it will be very hard for them to progress the games, because you NEED to do raids to progress. Recently this has been alleviated with solo raids where ppl can enter alone. But it will never get to the point of an MMO like FFXIV, where they really cater to casual player base.

1599340,False,"The game is fundamentally built to disrespect all of your free time, which is truly sad considering it has some of the best combat I've ever seen in an ARPG with a lot of cool unique classes.

You CANNOT play just a single class and expect to get spots in Raids, and Dungeons. The meta in this game is to have as many alts as you can doing dailies and weekly missions on all to FUNNEL those rewards to your main character for more ATTEMPTS at RNG upgrading your gear. Which also sucks because the game has some of the coolest boss fights and dungeon mechanics.

Now what you have is an extremely TOXIC community that gate-keeps most of the end-game content behind an incredibly stupid grind, which only really affords your hardcore audiences the ability to experience most of that said content themselves, while casual players are given the finger and forced to pay other players to run them through (I believe they call it ""Bussing players"") the content.

Well, here's the thing: you can do dailies per character, not per account, and the materials for upgrading your gear that you obtain through daily events can be transferred between characters, allowing you to earn for your main by playing alts. The game puts you in a position where to play effectively, you need multiple characters.

Imagine doing the same thing over and over with several characters throughout the day. You can also purchase materials for gear upgrades with real currency, and the costs of upgrading are high, with a lot of RNG involved. The mechanics of this game don't make sense; it's a waste of time unless you enjoy doing repetitive tasks day in and day out on multiple characters and occasionally splurging real cash on materials that might improve your gear.

That being said, this game was a blast at launch. The combat was engaging, diverse and fun as hell. I have never played an MMO where I felt like more of a bad ass. It is almost a bit much at times. You are constantly the savior of the universe in over the top battles with stunning visuals! I loved it!

It is however, hard to ignore the issues with this game. There was definitely an element of pay to win that existed in the game, as well as a gross issue with bot accounts that were constantly farming areas. If you have not kept up with raid battles and boss patterns it is also extremely hard to jump into the game in future states, as most of the player base consists of toxic veterans who have no patience for allowing you to learn. 

My biggest issue with the game however, is that it just did not respect my time. This is nothing new in the world of MMOs, and some people prefer to melt into their gaming chairs and never exist outside their rooms ever again, and this is fine. You do you. However, for some reason I found this game to disrespect my time even worse than other MMOs I have played... just the way I felt playing the game. The grind in this game is absolutely disgusting. So if you love completing repetitive tasks where you skip dialogue boxes for hours and hours on end and run from fetch quest to fetch quest until your IRL funeral rolls around this is the game for you! But hey, the combat is fun and the music and visuals are drool-worthy!

The game is grossly over-monetized and for the reasons listed above I cannot recommend it.

1599340,False,"Short:
The game is designed very very specifically to get you locked into its compulsion loops through FOMO. Smilegate likely hires more behavioral scientists than it does game developers. I'd wager that the only reason most veteran players still play are because they are either stuck in the loop, or because of the sunken cost of how much they've already spent on the game. All progression in the game is time gated so as to promote spending to bypass these gates.

Combat and SOME raid design is the only good thing about this game. Everything else, the compulsion loop, a lot of QOL, class balance, story delivery, launch time (it's 2024), etc. are absolute trash.

It seems counterintuitive to give a bad review for a game I put in 9.4k hours on, but that is the power of the FOMO compulsion loop. 

Long:
Pre-launch (day 2) veteran player that played at the top edge of the end game through every content release from Argos to Thaemine HM and would be ready for the next two content releases (Behemoth & Echidna). 300 roster level ""F2P"" ($100 total) success story with a juiced main (1633, all 10s, +25 Akkan weapon, 9/7 stone, 40 elixir) and an accompanying roster of seven adequately geared 1600-1610 DPS chars.

Game optimization is reaaaalllllyyy bad. As an old game running on Unreal Engine 3, it is likely a monstrosity of spaghetti code at this point. It takes forever to launch and is just horribly optimized. 

The overall story of Lost Ark is decent, with a portion of players considering it to be really good. However, try to ask most veteran players what this story is, and they wouldn't be able to tell you for two reasons. First, the compulsion loop and time gating promotes getting your ""homework"" done as fast as possible. This leaves little time to try and enjoy the story, which for some parts (even with Shift+G skipping) can take hours. Second, the delivery of this story is atrocious. Random clips, (overly) dramatic pauses, forced ""roleplay"" (sit here 10 seconds while your char talks to NPC), and many other issues make actually trying to go through the story a huge bore.

This rush to get homework done also makes the community really bad for new players. This will never be truly changed because they want players to FOMO and pay to bypass time gating. 

The GUI is horrible at saving window positions. Certain things, like trying to hit tripods are just poorly designed so that the two buttons you need to press for an attempt are offset just enough to leave only a fraction of a millimeter to click both buttons without having to move your mouse.

Everything is RNG. How strong you are, and if you spend money, how much you need to spend, is entirely dependent on RNG. Random gold income such as accessory drops, fate embers, or sidereal energies (some people getting multiples) completely change the player experience. Every single system to increase character strength is RNG, such as gear quality, honing gear, cutting rocks, elixirs, transcendence, combining gems, with some of these systems having multiple layers of RNG.

Combat and raid design (difficulty) are the only good thing about this game, but even these two areas have issues. 

Combat is fun in that it's mostly fast paced and reactive. It feels good to play a character and use your skills during encounters to try and maximize your damage output. Many classes are designed well with their skill rotation so that this is just fun and probably one of the better designed combat systems. 

However, the issue is with how that design fares in raid design or even PVP (GVG). Classes have evolved over time because the raid design has evolved. This raid design has hit snags MANY times and ultimately, much of the difficulty is more annoyance than actual difficulty (attacks hidden behind the boss, screen/background color closely resembling attack colors). Since all enemy attack rotations are completely randomized, there are a lot of instances in raids where bosses can overlap dangerous skills, or sit up against a wall where positional attacks are restricted (and some skills become infinitely more dangerous). Also, some encounters have been designed well in which attacks that can be countered will ignore the internal cooldown, but many are just spaghetti in how this ICD is approached, which honestly shouldn't exist at all for a skill check that can (due to random enemy rotations) happen multiple times within the ICD.

Smilegate is also just absolutely horrible at how long it takes to balance its classes or the game in general, and with how they're balanced. Many classes have been in need of a rework for upwards of a year or more. It's also pretty well known that every new class is purposely overtuned to attract players before it's ""balanced"" back down after all the FOMO spending to build up that character. For example, the problem with the entropy (back attack) set still doesn't have a solution on the horizon, and I'd wager whatever they eventually implement will suck.

Also, most people don't care about this, but the recent S-tier GVG island changes are also just, to put it bluntly, retarded.

Although AGS has its hands tied in many regards, it also sucks at fixing many of the issues that it can push for. Win trading in PVP Arena (submitting video proof = witch hunt/bullying), teaming on Primal, chaos botting, and although cracking down recently, combating RMT are just some examples.

I would not recommend this game to anybody. It's designed to feed on your addiction and actively promotes FOMO which leads to toxic behavior.",1714693595,565189.0,True,False,False,263,17,0.906541883945465
1599340,False,"Finally decided to quit this game long overdue just look at my hours. I cannot recommend new players at its current state. There is just so many core issues with the game and they just keep pushing trash vertical progression systems with the new raids you will always be behind as a F2P. The party finder pug scene is the worst especially in the latest content if you miss a week of doing it your already behind and will get gate kept. These guys have 6 alts at current content ilvl and will demand 5 or 10 clears after the first week of a raid to get into their lobby. Game is filled with bots and RMT which they didnt punish for years, only recently they decide to do something but its not enough its way too late!

The combat and class design is what made me play for so long, but everything else including the dailies, the job simulator doing your 6 characters raids every week for gold will demand alot of you. You will also have to invest alot into alts if you wanted to get into pug groups also. You wont have time for anything besides this game unless you pay for gold its all designed that way. There is a big issue of game design needing a support for raids and they are only reinforcing it with each new raid coming out making them needed much more every time. The end game is lobbies waiting for supports. Unless you decide to main a support, good luck being a DPS if your not top notch gear with full lvl 10 gems ect. I had all the gear as a DPS but you will always be out shined by the RMT guy who whaled way more.

Thaemine was a predictable WASTE OF TIME. As i said to myself and later to a friend, this probably its going to be the 1st and the last Korean MMO that i play, yeah... never again, it's ""fun"" when it comes to the RAW game play of each character, they are truly unique and REALLY fun to play with, with pretty effects and the animations are TOP NOTCH, but the progress and the endgame and the grind... Makes it feel like a job man, GOD KNOWS i hate that feeling WITH PASSION, i stopped doing regular jobs because of that feeling and because of that THE GAME GETS BORING AF, there was this day (when i opened my eyes) when after finishing all the dailies and all the raids i felt ""FREE"" like a weight lifted off my shoulders (LITERALLY) and i was like ""wtf"".... THAT IS WHEN I SAID, F THIS ""GAME"", There are no real ""GAMERS"" here only SLAVES that are here to accomplish the next ""endgame"" rinse and repeat whenever ""new content"" comes out, F THAT.

""Lost Ark"" is the legit owner of one terrible GOD AWFUL and LONG TEDIOUS and BORING story with QUITE A LOT OF CRINGE moments it doesn't feel like a game made by/for adults it feels very very infantile, with a lot of social discrepancies/ineptitude which, depending on the content it can be disturbing in a really bad way AND IT LACKS A SH*T TON OF APTITUDE, its infantile, inept and FLACCID and very poorly written... Feiton, IMO, has the best short cuts but only because of the action scenes, anyway, I let my gf down once, i was fortunate to learn my lesson. If you are thinking about playing... Please DON'T, The game is not at all new player friendly, there's only a few (VERY FEW) people out there that make other/new people feel welcomed, same as guild leaders there's only a couple (not exaggerating here) that could be looked at as real leaders, and yeah... those are not whales... not a single one of them.

Unfortunately the players are to blame here too (as greatly as smilegate, sometimes EVEN MORE) instead of correcting the ""deaf hears"" of smilegate they help and support the FUNDAMENTALLY BAD practices that the game itself gives us, in most cases, leading to no option but to practice RMT which is {Insert mentally challenged word here} but yeah this community shares AS MUCH BLAME as the game creators.

I managed to down my daily playtime to an hour and a half only with 5 active gold earner characters, BUT Wednesdays, yeah nah at least 6+ hours. Never ever joined a static group, despite having friends to play with, but the game shouldn't be built like that, this cuts opportunities to meet new people and have new experiences and expand the community/experience and provide the FUN which is NONE EXISTENT HERE, THE PEOPLE ITSELF GIVES NEW/THE MOST EXPERIENCES IN ANY MMO, BUT THAT FAILS IN THIS ONE, MONUMENTALLY, so YES the community itself its ripping that apart and sometimes it feels that the players really want that to happen completely, so no don't blame smilegate blame yourselves as much if not more, its like looking at a ""Uroboros"".

Thus i WHOLEHEARTEDLY cannot recommend this game.

Occasionally  I buy a bus (paying ppl to do the raid for you) cos I'm too lazy to learn the mechanics + there is extreme gatekeeping and toxicity if you screw up and wipe the raid even once. 
So better to just buy it and not deal with that stress. If you wanna do raiding look for ""Learning Party"" groups but even then it's a 50/50 it's someone patient or trolls.

If you can find dedicated friends to play it's way better. A guild with helpful members also but you'll be looking at discords for that. Don't use the in-game guild finder unless u just want guild perks, most of them are completely dead anyway. 

there's a trillion small things more... it's best to just look at Maxroll or /r/lostarkgame for general guides. Just be warned this game is VERY anti-new friendly and hell to learn raids. If u just wanna play casual and play through the story it's fine though. Community is mostly old/day 1 players like me that are either helpful or worst humanity has.

It's at least free though and every now and then Smilegate gives out freebie stuff.

1599340,False,"Will not recommend to play this game in 2024, despite having over 5k hours in the game. There are just too many cons about the game that ultimately led to me quitting.

combat gameplay 9/10
graphics 8/10 (characters, skins and sfx look good despite being on UE3) 
class diversity 8/10
story 1/10 (story is ok but presentation to players is trash)
personal base/stronghold system 6/10 (nothing useful to do in strongholds except to make feasts and showoff some accolades)

I'll start by listing the pros then the cons of the game.

Pros:
1. Great character customization. From the facial details to the amount of skins and dyes that are made available to the players who play consistently, there is a wide variety of things one can do to customize and create their own unique character appearance.

2. Good amount of depth in terms of game, class, gear and raid mechanics. Just to understand how all the classes work with each other in raids alongside grinding for gear upgrades to attempt harder raids can easily allow players to have hundreds of hours of playtime.

3. A hardcore free to play player can actually grind and keep up with pay to win players if they only focus on one main character. 

Cons:
1. Bad monetization model. As the game is free to play, smilegate has decided to monetize mainly on game progression. This causes a series of problems in the game's economy as more and more rng progression systems are being added into the game.

2. Multiple layers of rng gated progression systems. For an endgame player to be able to get accepted into raid parties, one has to be able to bypass several layers of rng checks despite after playing for hundreds of hours. One has to have sufficient card set levels, gem levels, gear score, weapon level upgrade, passive card bonuses aka demon dmg %, elixirs, transcendence and much more to come as we get further updates similar to the korean servers. Each individual system requires player to dedicate a set amount of time, usually in terms of months while cards can set one back for years if you do not spend money or gold to actively purchase card packs.

3. Gold is king in lost ark, it is also a poison because of how useful it is. As each player would require an absurd amount of gold in order to progress a single character into end game, gold is required in almost every action that leads to progression in the game a.k.a. game is heavily pay to win. As such, the NA server that i played in was severely infested with bots so that they could generate and sell tons of third party gold.

4. With the influx of botted gold and rmt, it causes inflation to the auction house and blue crystal prices. As many players are rmt-ing and abusing the system, blue crystal prices are so high that most normal f2p players cannot afford to spend blue crystal unless they halt or delay their account progression.
(For new players who are unaware, blue crystal can be bought with in game gold through cash shop exchange. It can be used to buy some cash shop items like skins and premium service for account wide monthly bonuses without needing to spend real money in game.)

5. Difference between 1 tap upgrades and pitying gear at endgame is too huge. As thaemine raid is approaching, a +25 weapon is somewhat required if you to be able to join pugs and compete against the veterans as well as whales and rmt-ers. Between a 1 tap +25 vs 100% pity can somewhat be calculated to at least 3 million gold. A normal player who does all his raids would only gain an average of 200k gold per week. If your friend 1 taps and you pity +25 weapon, your progression would be 15 weeks apart, of course none of that matters if you decide to spend money into the game.

6. After you pass all the gear check, card check, rng check, roster level check, you are still at the mercy of gatekeeping by randoms for all sorts of stupid reasons simply because some raids require either too much teamwork or are too punishing if one player dies. As a result of that, the game's player pool does not grow much and its mostly the same group of veterans who would stick to this game. 

7. Hard mode and normal mode raid design system is just bad. In Lost Ark, the endgame pve raids are mostly your legion raids that are being classified into two main modes. Normal mode for people who are slightly more casual and cannot keep up with progression due to not having enough time commitment, being unlucky with gear upgrades or other reasons. Hard mode for the more hardcore audience who wants more challenge and can afford to either spend more time playing the game or more money to buy progression. Due to this system, it causes it a huge divide in players because there are weekly lockouts and usually players who have reached hard mode progression would not play with players in normal mode due to a significant difference in raid rewards.

8. Too much elitists in the game because the game punishes players on several different levels. As the game requires players to generate significantly more gold as new patches and gear thresholds are introduced. It becomes pivotal for players to be able to finish their weekly raids and claim the max amount of raid gold in the shortest amount of time. Due to this, many players would only opt to play with the same few people that they know to save time. These people would gatekeep new players as they are less geared or have less experience in raids and thus have a higher tendency to cause raid wipes and would largely extend the amount of time required to clear raids. 3rd party dps meters are also available in this game and it just makes the whole situation even worse.

9. Main reason why i quit the game was because my own friends who stuck to this game won't even raid with me. I quit the game once after the first year of release at 4.4k hours. At that time brelshraza hard was the end game raid, came back and played for 2 months when voldis and souleater were released. I have a roster level of 290+ and los30 card set that was naturally built up just by playing the game for almost 1 and half year. (Even after quitting at the 1 year mark, id still login every once in a while to claim free event legendary card packs.) Most veterans in the game are too focused on being efficient in generating gold as they do not want to spend unnecessary money into the game for progression. As such, they just end up isolating themselves in their own social circle. So after going back to lost ark in year 2, it just made me realise that the only ones left playing are either whales or veteran tryhards left in the game who cant afford to quit the game due to sunk cost fallacy.

Ending notes:
This is a good game for people who have no self control and severe gambling addiction. The whole game is designed like a casino for players to throw money to AGS or buy 3rd party gold to gamble and risk getting banned. Oh and one more thing, not playing the game is actually a net positive in terms of character progression. As the game is bleeding new players, the devs approach is to keep giving free event stuff for new players to catch up. A good example would be my newly created character that has only been played for 2 months could almost catch up to the progression of another player that has stuck to the game for 1 year+. The devs would continue to push out freebies to new players and beat their own rng traps that they have laid for whales to spend money onto the game. If they don't do so, then the game would ultimately just bleed to death and server closure would be impending.",1712679349,339845.0,True,False,False,66,2,0.8156655430793762
1599340,False,"it was a great game when its alive but now there is nothing to do.

you can't do any of the endgame content by solo
you can't even do them with few friends because there is no one playing except overleveled players who is bussing the content for money
it has 1 type of currency that needed for everything
if you want to upgrade, you need gold
if you need material to upgrade, you need gold
if you want to gain gold, you have to pay gold

game already giving tons of items except gold but its ok if it give gold it would be meanless since you wont have any reason to play the game.

1599340,True,"Great F2P ARPG. Technicly an MMO. You'll see other players all the time but most of the content will be played solo. However this game is a partial collectathon. There is quite litterally thousands of collectibles little things in the game that give fun rewards. It scratches an itch I didnt know I had. If you like ARPGs or MMOs just try it. Game looks great and plays great.


I have not ever felt inclined to spend money on this game. Only untill im at the peak-PEAK of the End-Game do I see an upgrade system that pushes you towards it. However this is after 650+ hours of gameplay. I could simply just not engage anymore or slow my progression.

It does still have bot issues. Most of the time they're just an eye sore. Bands of them clogging up some afk town spot.

1599340,True,"Embarking on the voyage that is Lost Ark feels like setting sail into a vast, uncharted ocean, teeming with promise, adventure, and, yes, the inevitable grind that comes with any MMO worth its salt. From the moment you step into its beautifully rendered world, it's evident: Lost Ark isn't just any MMO; it's a behemoth of content, lore, and gameplay that could easily consume 500+ hours of your life.

To get straight to the point, if a blend of action-packed combat and traditional MMO elements isn't your cup of tea, then Lost Ark might just leave you adrift. The game is a marvel of combat mechanics, combining the fast-paced, skill-based action of ARPGs with the depth and complexity of MMOs. This hybrid creates a combat experience that's as rewarding as it is exhilarating, demanding precision, strategy, and, at times, a willingness to dive into the fray without hesitation.

As someone who's navigated the seas of countless MMOs, both as a fervent enthusiast and a so-called ""filthy casual,"" I find Lost Ark's approach to player engagement genuinely refreshing. The game respects the player's time, offering a plethora of activities that feel meaningful and rewarding. Whether it's questing through its expansive world, delving into dungeons, or participating in massive open-world events, every action feels like a step forward in your adventure.

Lost Ark's narrative is another treasure waiting to be unearthed. The storytelling is rich, with a lore that is as deep as it is intriguing. The game world is not just a backdrop for your quests but a character in its own right, filled with mysteries to solve, factions to interact with, and stories to be a part of. The narrative depth adds a compelling layer to the gameplay, making every quest feel like a piece of a larger puzzle you're slowly putting together.

When it comes to the social and end-game content, Lost Ark truly shines. The cooperative aspect of raiding, exploring, and conquering challenges with fellow adventurers is seamless, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose. The end-game content is robust, offering challenging dungeons and raids that demand teamwork and strategic thinking, ensuring that the game remains engaging long after the main story has concluded.

However, it's impossible to discuss an MMO without touching on the concerns of pay-to-win (P2W) mechanics. Lost Ark navigates these turbulent waters with care, ensuring that the game remains accessible and fair. While there are monetization elements, they are implemented in a way that respects the player's experience and investment, focusing on cosmetic and convenience items rather than game-altering advantages.

Lost Ark is generous, not just in terms of the sheer volume of content but in how it rewards players. The game showers adventurers with loot, resources, and experience, making every session feel productive. This generosity extends to the game's approach to character progression and skill mastery, where players are encouraged to experiment and find the playstyle that best suits them.

In terms of accessibility, Lost Ark manages to be both inviting to newcomers and challenging to MMO veterans. The game offers a range of difficulty levels and activities that cater to all types of players, from those looking to immerse themselves in the story and world to those eager to test their mettle against the toughest challenges.

Lost Ark is a monumental achievement in the MMO genre, a game that charts its own course with confidence and flair. It's a game that demands attention, not just for the breadth of its content but for the depth of its gameplay, storytelling, and world-building. For anyone who's ever felt the call of adventure, Lost Ark is a journey worth embarking on, offering a world of discovery, challenge, and camaraderie that's as boundless as the seas it invites you to explore.",1712035379,24910.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4761904776096343

The customer support for this game is complete garbage. I spent 33 dollars on the first account that got banned. The appeal was denied for that account. They basically stole my money and responded with a copy paste reply in the ticket saying a known cheat program was detected which is a flat out lie. I decided to make a second account and record all of my gameplay which I do have available. That account got banned with the same reason. I made a 3rd account which was the second one that got banned.

Used my ""boost gift"" that gave me 1460 GS, with random shit stats, so i decided to buy anything with right stats for my new class. Oh wait, i cant, my whole gold is gone, had over 50k gold, now i have 0. Nvm, lets open 100+ gifts from mailbox, 50% of it was silver, some materials for honing and other cards, potions skins etc, (0 shards so cant do honing anyway). Wanted to sell some stuff, to be able to buy some engraving books for my new char - i cant, my auction house is blocked for 48h. Managed to sort stuff, set my stat points in skills, found some engraving gifts, so was able to make at least a couple of engravings. (Btw almost everything that i had in my roster storage is gone, checked storage box, everything is gone, i had over 500 engraving books just sitting there and waiting for me to come back one day - everything gone). So i ignored all that shit and just jumped into chaos dung where i was doing like none dmg, but managed to finish 2 of them. After that I was able to do one honing but as u know it failed anyway. When i tried a raid i waited in que for 30 mins and gave up.
So conclusion:
Game gave me millions of mats for honing- but 0 shards so i cant use them anyway 
I have 0 gold, so cant buy anything to improve my jewelery and engravings
Cant do alt farming - my every alt is under 1400 and its gonna be impossible to gear them up to 1460 (+i dont want to )
Raids are gone for me, no time to wait 30 + min in que for a raid

1599340,False,"The conclusion: The combat stands out in this game and makes me wish it was good and worth playing, sadly its really not. How you consume the content is the biggest criminal in this game.

The bossmusic is really well designed and integrated to the boss its made for. The classes and how skills feels to use is absolutely amazing in this game

The Bad: The way content is consumed (and designed to be consumed). It trivialises all the content, Pushes people into a bad workaholic relationship with the game, and encourages some heavy gatekeeping. Islands are not designed with new players in mind. Catch up mechanic is take new players that dont know how to play and drop them right in the endgame (im sure that wont be terrible for everyone) More bots than I can remember ever seeing in a game.

If you're a solo player then don't be fooled, this is not a game for you outside of the story.  No matter how generous the devs are with freebie materials (and they are generous) the RNG for upgrading gear honing system farming will burn you out if you want to enter raids. The reason being the only way to get into groups which don't have bots are in the lobby and they will be asking you for a ridiculously over the top item level requirement unless you are a support class.
The only other way to get in would be to join a guild but then you wouldn't really be a solo player then.

What is this 0.5 to 2 second delay on clicking everything from ""Accept"" to simply loading up achievements. I have never encountered a game with such a weird loading issue (and no it's not my comp because i can play Cyberpunk 2077 just fine). Almost every click makes another hair on my face go grey.

Maintenance Days:
Why oh WHY do they have to touch inventory items and put them into Universal Storage for you to collect? This is nonsensical and again I have never seen this in any other game I have played.
Recent server mergers retroactively reduced my Card Cap for some reason. When looting it hit cap at 260/260 from the Universal Storage but 28 more cards are sitting in limbo being unable to be retrieved which were saved in the card roster, NOT in my bags or personal storage.

Stronghold: Although it can provide you with buffs it just feels like unnecessary fluff they could've just given your character in other ways. If you're not into stickers or posing you won't want this...but it's required for reducing your material costs which I find a bit of a slight of hand cheap trick.

It's a terrible shame that what felt like a REALLY fun game to start with at launch now feels like a second job to pay off a second mortgage. Una's Dailies, Shipping and Island Co-op, Chaos dungeons, Abyss dungeons, Guardian Raids all get stale very quick. I seriously doubt these recent server mergers will help anything much apart from more lag.

i wrote all of this just so i can suggest one thing that might actually help people even just a little bit .the devs need to allow players to do the dungeons and raids more than once every week of course without any rewards after the first clear. this way people who know the raids would clear everything with their team and get their weekly rewards and after that they can help people learn without the fear of getting jailed and losing their weekly rewards.

It’s a burnout machine—especially if you're trying to max out quickly.

There's RNG on gear quality, RNG on leveling your item level, RNG on engravings, RNG on gems—and the nightmare that is trying to get the Light of Salvation cards? Pure pain.

1599340,False,"If you think it's worth return as a player in 2024? The short answer is no.
I have quit playing Lost Ark almost 2 years ago, when Valtan raid was introduced. The reason was the grind for new content was merciless and pushing single item level points takes weeks due to honing low rate of success and amount of mats needed for an attempt. The other reason was that content releasing was unacceptably slow, so you were stuck with same content for months without any additional rewards. Even though Korean version of the game has loads of new content awaiting for EU server.
Now I decided to give it another go, since more new content was introduced in the time of absence, and I invested 700h of gameplay as I really enjoyed the lore so much. The reality was that I was unable to play any non-solo content.
1. Legion Raids lowest item level is 1415. Having characters on 1350 - 1405 item level I am not even able join them
2. Low T3 Guardian Raid, Abbyss Raid, Cube - there's no matchmaking as there is no new/returning players. The content is dead.
3. Gatekeeping - even if I would stop being F2P player and start whaling and buy mats for $$$, I would not be accepted in matchmaking of current content as people just allow others than have mastered the current raids mechanics. There's no Raid learning parties anymore.
I am unable to play the game, no sustainable way to catch up. No, merging servers did not solve the problem. I literally see just one single player in Matchmaking queue, after the merge. The only way would be to find some higher level players and ask them to do the content for me, but in my situation I play when I can, and I cannot rely on other ways than just matchmaking.

1599340,False,"So to start, this review is for NEW players. 
I'haven't swiped at all in this game except for a few skins and the starter pack I bought 2 years ago. I have a main at Item Level 1620. I have a few alts I like to play that are 1580+.

Honestly I really liked playing through the game when it launched with my best friend and getting to raid with my buddies from another game. With that, I can recommend playing the game for the Main Story Quest and then quit when it gets too grindy for you if you're playing solo.

If you have a solid 6-7 friends to play this with, it's fun but reaching all the endgame fights will be a stretch for you all till about 6 months in when you can all reliably farm the Item Level content you'll be on for the 6 character roster you'll need for all of the items on the list below.
-Gold (Limited per week gain in raids per character (max of 6))
-Silver (Limited daily gain per character)
-Cards (EXTREME RNG, Massive Pool of useless cards/sets) ****Gatekeeping issue
-Mats to hone (Daily limit, more can be bought for gold on the Auction House)
-The trade skill mats to hone (Daily limit, Can also be bough on Auction House or recharged through the Cash Shop)
-Engraving books (Much easier to obtain through the Auction house now for cheap gold prices, Except newer class engravings)
- Engraving Stone (Possible massive Pheon Sink - If you run out, Only option is Cash shop them for a large amount of your weekly gold or your credit card sword can farm them)
and last but Definitely not least... -Skill GEMS!!!  ****Gatekeeping issue if not high enough

You will need to reliably farm all of these on 6 characters Weekly to push for the final endgame raid fights you'll see in about 5-6 months time. Unless you all wish to buy gold from Smilegate to buy all of the other materials JUST to upgrade your Item Level on your armor and weapon. Which will easily cost you over $300 for 1 character to be 1580+ with everything they'll need to raid... Except Gems and Cards. If you want decent gems(Level 9's) you'll have to double that amount of swiping for most class builds. Cards are even worse to swipe for.
Gems at current endgame aren't considered good until they are Level 9.  One level 9 gem usually takes around a month and a half to reliably farm with your 6 man roster all over 1540+.(1 character usually needs all 11 gems slots filled) Cards on the other hand are just extremely RNG based and will likely take you easily a year 1/2 to get some of the best ones finished without swiping your credit card.

Now Making alts has a horrible set-back for new players. You need to have perfect stat RNG rolled Accessories for each piece of gear with the correct perfectly RNG rolled engravings on them as well. YOU WILL NOT GET ANY OF THE ACCESSORIES YOU NEED DROPPED. I haven't encountered anyone this lucky when they first start the game. So what do you do? You'll need to buy MOST, if not all of your accessories from the Auction House. On top of spending gold to buy these, you also need Pheons for each purchase, which are sold in.... Yes you got it, in the Cash Shop. You will get free Pheons playing the game but this will probably be enough for your first 2 characters accessories/Engraving Stones... If you don't mess up/fail/or want to change your build. You can also purchase these with gold, expect to pay a few weeks of your earned gold in raids to buy the Pheons needed alone.

If you can handle doing this for 6 characters with your friends for at least 5-6 months for the grind, you'll eventually catch up to the bottom tier of endgame raiders. Yes the bottom tier.
Most Gatekeeping will keep you to only playing with your friends, other than early endgame raids like Valtan/Vykas and possibly Clown, which will take 10-20mins to fill up the other 7(or 3) slots.

The only Decent times to jump in with your team of friends are when the game's having events for new classes coming to the West. Which will give you a free PASS on the gear / accessories / engravings needed to progress for 3-4(?) months. (Not including card sets) You'll have this free boost until the event ends and you'll need to have bought all your accessories and engraving books you'll need for your classes build by then for that ONE boosted character.

To sum this up, No I can't recommend this game to new players. It is not friendly to people starting the game at all if your goal is to experience the whole game or to join the people who have been playing since the start. Which is almost the only player base that's left playing this game. Early content is already completely abandoned and you'll have to solo it all if you're alone.",1709726235,282696.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.5147058963775634

Following the disbanding of my static, everyone felt burnout leading to everyone quitting, it's been half a year since I last played the game. I hesitate to recommend this game to anyone due to its notably toxic environment and community. Players are often forced to join a static or use third-party platforms like Discord to find a more welcoming community, which detracts from the traditional MMO vibe. Feeling gate kept? don't worry, thousands-hour veterans often get gatekept as well.  Despite numerous catch-up features, the game struggles with retaining new players. This is partly due to the lackluster enthusiasm for helping newbies, since everyone got 18 - 36 raids, 252 chaos dungeons, and 126 guardians to run a week, and nobody has time for jailage. if you make a mistake, no biggie, we re-try, oh, you mess up for the second time? Well, too bad, go look up a guide since we going to quit raid and kick you out. Moreover, the stark reality that some if not everyone, would opt for RMT to swiftly achieve what takes months of your hard grind can be disheartening.

1599340,False,"How do I start? I have been playing this game every day since Western release launch. I swipe a lot in this game. Like enough to buy a nice new car. It's a game I really enjoy and like any hobby you end up putting money into it.  I enjoy cosmetics so I buy every skin for all my characters. That adds up. I swipe in-game for gold and materials. In my opinion, it's not any worse than buying really expensive clothes or go out to fancy restaurants (I do neither).

So that all said, entire roster is at end-game. I do the latest raids, and still trying to gear up my characters higher. You could say I really want this game to succeed and continue growing, and I would love to see new players come in and get to where I am as soon as possible and enjoy the game at the level that I am enjoying it.

However, it seems Amazon and/or Smilegate don't think this way. Every event is lackluster. The latest event is advertised like a new player would gear up for the end-game but they don't even give people enough materials to get there! You have to not only get lucky with enhancements of gear, you have to also have to swipe for materials. That's not acceptable. The game has too many horizontal systems for a new player to understand let alone try to finish. Please give new players all the horizontals done. There is this really important system call cards. The new event gives new players half of the cards they need. Why? Just give them the full set! They don't because there is a $100 package in the store you have to buy to get more cards. The card system is a gacha so you have to pray you get cards you need.

I get it there are people that like grinding it out, but the majority of the new players don't want that. They see the awesome raids and they want to jump right into it. They don't want to swipe $300 just to barely get their foot in the door only for everyone to gate keep them. Let them get to end-game without paying a single cent so they can play a character, get hooked, so then they can be like me and think ""wow I really want to spend money to look cool.""

There are a lot of doomers out there will say the game is dying and Amazon is losing money. If you can make this accessible to everyone and let players in for free and gear up to the end-game raids for free, there will be plenty of people willing to swipe to make up for the difference. Think of how Google makes money, I got free emails, free drive storage, decent productivity apps. Yeah most people won't pay, but when I was thinking of what to choose for my work, I chose to use Google Workspace for my work and I'm more than happy to pay the monthly costs.

Now I have to get into the huge negative of this game and that is the unreasonable punishment for cheaters. When I say unreasonable I mean people that blatantly RMT and/or exploit are given only temporary suspensions for repeated offenses. There should be zero tolerance for cheating. The in-game cash shop is actually really expensive compared to RMT, so I understand why people do it. But as someone that has put a lot of hours into the game and swiped hard in-game, and have not RMT at all because I didn't want to get banned, everytime a cheater gets just a slap on the wrist, I feel like they are cutting us legitimate players.

This game experience as a veteran player is very good, and I'm always excited that the new event brings in new generation of players, but every time I see it's a huge cash grab and I worry people are eventually going to get sick of the same ol' bait and switch, and they're just going to give up.

I don't recommend the game unless the next event makes it worthwhile for someone to come in and enjoy it, and Amazon/Smilegate starts permanent banning cheaters not give them repeated chances.",1709184554,1192951.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

That honestly is just the tip of the iceberg--there are so many redundancies in this game that should be eliminated and more effort put into making the game more fun and less homework.

1599340,True,"Want to preface this review with the fact that I'm an avid World of Warcraft player since 2012. I've sunk thousands of hours into it so this is coming from a WoW player.

I've put almost 300 hours into this game, which isn't a lot compared to others but enough for me to write a somewhat informed review. For starters, this game is visually stunning; the zones are some of the most beautiful I've seen in any mmorpg and are consistently charming and interesting. Each zone feels somewhat unique and thematic and exploration is highly encouraged in the form of MANY collectables. The adventurers tome is genuinely one of the best features, giving a sense of completion to each zone and the large amounts of collectables means there's always something to do. Not only do you have each individual zone to explore with its own sub areas, the open sea is also explorable with LOTS of islands chock full of their own little quest lines and collectables in the form of Island Souls.

The story, in my opinion, is one of the strongest parts about this game. It's great, most of the quests have LOTS of voice acting that is generally really strong. Each quest has a multitude of cut scenes that look gorgeous and really help with the story telling. The main cast of characters are interesting and each have their own rapport system (friendship system) so if you really like a character you can spend some extra time with them. If you're looking for a great story that will suck you in, this game could be for you.

The combat is fluid, smooth and honestly some of the best combat in any mmorpg I've played. The customisation for your builds is varied and with a large amount of classes, there's definitely something that will suit your play style. A con of the combat is that classes and races are locked together. You cannot at this moment, play a male mage for example. As for end game content, there are many dungeons and raids you can participate in to earn rewards if raiding is your forte. I've only participated in a few raids myself as I'm not comfortable enough with them because they are DIFFICULT. There is so much to learn from the combat which itself is both a pro and a con.

Trade skills are present in this game and are very important to your grind of crafting materials, luckily the system is intuitive and honestly I think it's fun. I usually don't care for fishing or logging in games but these tasks don't seem so horrifying to me in this game. Levelling different professions and using the materials to craft my own upgrade materials for gear makes it feel more worthwhile.

Now for the cons of the game, because there are a lot. The game is repetitive, it requires you to do many daily quests that are honestly a bit of a pain in order to get gold which you pretty much need to upgrade your gear. Speaking of upgrading your gear, the honing system is very frustrating. Sometimes it can take 8 or more tries to upgrade ONE piece of gear and it uses all your materials that you worked so hard for. It is also encouraged to have more than one character available to earn gold on because having just ONE character will not be enough. Yes, you can PAY in the shop with real money for materials or gold so the game feels p2w sometimes and you feel like you will be permanently behind those who do pay. The same goes for skins too, there are beautiful skins in the game but sadly most of them are only sold through the shop via RMT.

All in all, I do think the game is worth it; especially if you're someone who plays these kinds of games for story or trade skills but I would keep in mind the cons that I've mentioned above! If you're someone who is exclusively here for raids you may find the tedious honing system something you can't put up with but I do think you should give the game a try if you're on the fence!",1708277038,16163.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

Of course you could not fomo and do things at your own pace, but then you'll be 'falling behind' and be gatekept if you ever decide to raid.

Amazon Games is the western publisher of this title and they have continually proven that their primary goal is profit. They have fumbled every key aspect of offering a live-service game. Check Google and Reddit for details... ""Pheongate"" is a good place to start.

The second anniversary celebration event, purportedly intended to celebrate and reward dedicated players, has been nothing but an insult. With the anniversary patch they introduced horrendous server lag, cash shop updates that outraged the playerbase, and an anniversary ""gift"" that was significantly nerfed from the version awarded to Korean players. Furthermore, advertisements of the anniversary patch indicated that certain valuable rewards would be included in the gift by featuring them in screenshots, only to have the items not included and screenshots edited after the fact. Community manager responses to players' complaints regarding the situation were condescending and tone-deaf.

Of course, there is a vocal group within the playerbase lashing out at those who are disappointed with the event, labelling anyone expressing disapproval as a ""free-to-play leech."" I'm hardly free to play and have done plenty to support this game officially, yet I am also in the group that is unhappy with the status quo.

The cash shop offerings have decreased in value over time, with more ""cash grab"" packages being introduced and sought-after cosmetics locked in bundles with a high pricetag. The ""Black Friday"" deals introduced the last few years have been comical rip-offs.

With a dwindling playerbase, it appears that Amazon is looking to milk the remaining players for all they're worth before end of service.

I quit Lost Ark because of burnout about 4 months ago, and as time passes I miss it less and less after seeing its pain points continuously getting worse.

However, before I dunk on it like everyone else, I'd like to mention [b]reasons why you would want to play this game[/b], and even vastly enjoy it with the right company:
[list]
[*]Combat is one of the best in the MMO market, if not THE best. Everything is fluid and responsive. Skill VFX and SFX are fantastic, over the top and impactful. You feel like a god from level 1 and it only gets better from there as you unlock more skills and get better gear.
[*]All classes have their own distinct playstyle and identity, and combined with the action combat make up for a very fun time. The class engraving system further expands on this by splitting each and every class into 2 playstyles the player can choose to go for as they play the game.
[*]The Raids and Dungeons have wonderful presentation and are very fun to go through for the first time. The developers took advantage of the top-down angles to pan the camera towards scenery when fitting, giving a much more cinematic experience to everything. In terms of effects, they really pushed UE3 to its limits all things considered, even if many models look dated nowadays (but that's a given for most MMOs).
[*]The game is F2P, [i]technically[/i] no single piece of content is locked behind a necessary pay wall.
[/list]

This is about where the positives of the game end. Those are quite important, mind you. They are enough to give the game an AMAZING core to work with.

[b]What the developer and publisher chose to do with that core is where everything went wrong.[/b]

[b]Smilegate RPG[/b], the developer of the game and publisher in Korea, are a Korean developer. That means that the player's relationship with the game and the company is bound to be abusive. Smilegate are definitely no exception to this fact, and thus prove that by making the experience of progressing through the game miserable to anyone who isn't playing this game as a first (not second) job, or doesn't swipe 3-4 figures every month. To be more precise:
[list]
[*]The game is riddled with P2W and time gated systems that consist of layers upon layers upon layers of RNG that make even gacha games shudder. The majority of the playerbase will expect you to have those systems maxed out, or you will be gatekept from content new and old.
[*]The progression materials you can earn without swiping are about enough to progress at a reasonable pace, IF you do your dailies across all your characters that can take up to 2 hours, and additionally play one and a half dozen raids [i]every week[/i], across multiple characters. Needless to say, that's a big time investment, considering each raid can take about 20 minutes for the older ones, up to an hour for the newer ones, and obviously even more if everything doesn't go smoothly. And I don't want to claim that having to spend a lot of time on an MMO is a problem; the real problem is that if you ever leave this treadmill for even a few weeks, you will inevitably fall behind the active playerbase, which in turn will gatekeep you from most of the relevant content. And you won't be able to catch up to it if you don't swipe. Hell, even if you never leave the treadmill, all it takes is for you to be pretty unlucky (which will statistically happen at some point if you play long enough) and even with your maximum efforts you won't be able to reach the next raid on release. And if you're a new player, you will always be at the bottom of the totem pole and will never be able to catch up to veterans.
[*]The game does not offer any meaningful casual raiding content or solo content. Everything is midcore to hardcore, there are no easy versions of Raids that offer progression. This is not only bound to turn off many players trying to get into the game to begin with, but also further incentivize overgearing content, because Raids do not have item level sync. That means overgearing them can neuter a lot of otherwise dangerous mechanics, or even outright skip them. You can NOT join 95% of PF lobbies on item level (as in no one will accept you into their group), unless it's literally week 1 of the Raid's release.
[*]All the aforementioned points naturally lead to an impatient, toxic and elitist playerbase. I don't really have much else to say about this, it just sours the experience for everyone.
[/list]

Those were only the points that apply for all versions of the game, or at least Korea and Global. However, the Global publisher, [b]Amazon Games Studios[/b] (whose version you will be playing here on Steam, as the Korean version is IP and SSN blocked), have furthermore brought additional pain points to the table:
[list]
[*]The game is optimized like balls even compared to its KR counterpart, because it is a frankenstein build of some (not all) of the content of KR. Its anti-cheat system, EAC, is also seemingly implemented like balls; everyone gets countless errors due to it and its implementation makes the game need 3 minutes to open. What is more, the game very often has server issues that can last for months at a time without being addressed.
[*]Bots and RMT are rampant, obliterating the economy for everyone playing legally. AGS doesn't give half a shit about RMT-ers, giving them small holiday breaks at worst as punishment. Bots get banned too slowly.
[*]The Global version of the game, being a lot newer than the KR one, doesn't have the same endgame content as KR. AGS are trying to catch us up to KR, which is great, but with an accelerated pace for this grindy of a game there should also be more rewards. Except there aren't. We have double the pace with the same (or sometimes even fewer) rewards, something that furthers the pain of the treadmill point mentioned earlier. Most progression events are pitiful for anyone who isn't super new to the game.
[*]Nearly everything in the store is terrible value and disgustingly overpriced, something that can lead new players into wasting money, and veteran players to RMT.
[*]AGS are completely and utterly incompetent and out of touch. The global playerbase's complaints basically never get addressed, the community managers make comments that only add fuel to the fire, news posts always have conflicting and straight up wrong info, every patch that comes out has several bugs. They stagger balance patches and QoL and present them as content for whatever damn reason.
[*]Oh also if you're in Asia/OCE, poor company Amazon didn't make servers for you. Have fun playing at 200+ ping.
[/list]

Does this inspire you any hope for the Global version of the game? It definitely doesn't inspire me, and Lost Ark's steamcharts confirm this, where the only player increases nowadays are surges of bots. If the game's systems weren't already greedy, our version is even worse, with more bugs, server issues, fewer progression materials and a destroyed economy compared to its KR counterpart.

Even if I absolutely love the core of the game and truly believe it had the potential to be a 10/10, the next big MMO that could compare to the giants like WoW and FFXIV, it saddens me that in the end it was only used as a means to milk quick buck. In the closing of its second year the game has already faded into obscurity in the West, and everyone outside its now small playerbase refers to it as I do: ""combat and raids Good, everything else Shit"" and they're right. 

[b]I can only recommend the game to:[/b]
[list]
[*]Someone who wants to go through the MSQ for a few dozen hours because the combat looks cool.
[*]Someone who has a premade, 8-person static that wants to progress through the raiding content together.

1599340,False,"[h3]This will be a ""short"" review. [/h3]
[u]Positive:[/u]
- Combat and Raiding experience (top notch, it can be addictive)
- Skins are mostly nice
- DPS classes are really nice and unique

[u]Negative (not all of them):[/u]
- There is always big support shortage, because the role itself feels really boring and its really expensive to reach the current endgame but you cant really raid without supports
- The game is P2W but you are fine as a F2P player. You will progress slower.
- Every progression system was designed to timegate the players and dump their gold in it
- Lot of ingame system like guild, party finder, party management is outdated and somehow Smilegate doesnt want to update these systems
- More than half of the concurrent users are bots (thats around 20-30k+ bot)
- There is literally no communication ingame between players outside of raids
- Community is toxic
- Gear progression can be really frustrating with honing system and quality system
- The game has an ingame tax currency aka Pheon
- Every system tries to make you spend real money in the game. They made the game player unfriendly on purpose
- Most of the raids are unforgiven. That means if there is an 8 player raid, 1 player can wipe the whole raid on every difficulty
- Gatekeeping. Because you cant see the players experience or any necessary information about the player's experience, you will ""filter"" the players by a bunch of parameter (roster level, class, character level, gear, quality, stat, engraving, card sets, elixir and in the future we will get transcendence which is another parameter on the gatekeep list)
- Endgame content is limited for the majority of the players. Your weekly content will look like you do 3 raid / character + daily content which is around 15-20 minute and thats all. You cant really do any interesting content beside raids.

- Game is extremely new player unfriendly and veterans will never play with new players
[b]I want to elaborate this:[/b]
- As a new player you will leveling to 50. You wont meat any player only bots that farming golds.
Then you have to do a progression in a content where there is NOT A SINGLE player. You will be totally alone.
- As a new player, you are around 1000 hours behind if you are playing alone. You are missing lot of timegated stuff that requires for the BASIC character/roster(account) progression.
Thus, veteran players will NEVER play with a new player because 1 mistake by 1 player and thats a wipe.
Your only choice to play with friends or try to make new friends.

[h2]And the worst thing about this game is not even the game: THE PUBLISHER AKA AMAZON GAMES[/h2]
- They are completely out of touch with the community and with the game
- Their customer service is non existent
- They dont punish RMT players enough (1 day ban and you can play again), thus the bots go rampage
- Community coordinators and community managers are like bots. I dont even understand how they still have a job there
- If they dont like your opinion about how they handle the game, they will perma ban you from the official Discord server. Doesnt matter if you are not cursing or not provoking them. They dont like it -> perma ban. (same on Twitter/X, they will delete your comment)

1599340,False,"TLDR at bottom
As a small foreword, I have played the game since launch. Have taken some small breaks / etc but finally stopped playing actively on the December of last year. I have done all ''content'' on release as well as dabbled into the more difficult ''hell'' or inferno modes. 

First, the positives. The game has excellent combat and the classes feel fluid and different from each other. Even if the game didn't encourage multiple classes (more on that later) I would likely have made new ones just to try them out. The raids (main content of the game) are excellent and clearing them weekly, improving your time on it feels good. The skins in the game are nice albeit not too ''fantasy-like''. The gearing system and power systems in the game are good, for many people lost ark may be the first korean mmo and as such they aren't used to the ''grindy'' honing system. To me, honing your gear over the span of several months feels better than clearing the same raid for 6 months and waiting for your loot to drop and when it does, the loot council just gives it to a worse performer. There is the RNG element  but viewing the honing pity bar as a progress bar and being positively surprised if you hit the upgrade before pity is a nice way to look at it. Nowadays you also get your relic set in one week and once you have it, you can freely change it anytime. Going back to the ''content'' of the game, the inferno modes are great (more difficult, equalized content) and they are what kept me playing this long.

Now for the negatives. Other than honing, there are many more power systems in the game. One of them is skillpoints, which forces you to do non-combat content such as collectibles. Unlocking them gradually from the launch of the game wasn't bad, but some of the collectibles require co-op and as most people are ''done'' with them, good luck if you are a new player. Another major flaw is the card system and while this has been steadily improved, I only recently got the ''best'' card set in the game (having played for almost 2 years). The system encourages you to spend and even if you do, you can only buy card packs which are full rng. Other than that the daily grind while it has been improved is still bad, as the game encourages you to play multiple characters. Sure if you are efficient you can be done with 6 character dailies in under 2 hours, but its so monotone. As well as that, there is no way you can ''grind'' for hours on your main character, as all content is time gated. The ''weeklies'' or raids feel fun at first, but once you do the same new raid 6 times per week on different characters it becomes a snooze fest.

Now the most glaring issue of the game that keeps it from growing is the new player experience. As a new player, you need to clear the older content first which almost no one does. This content is usually ''bussed'' where you pay a more geared player to do it while you afk in the group. This makes new players not experience the older raids at all, so why do they even exist at that point? The new player experience has been significantly improved but at the time of writing this, is still absolutely horrendous. The main painpoint is the fact that that as the main way to make gold or the currency of the game is to clear raids and as you can only do 3 per character per week, you are encouraged to make 6 characters and thus clear 18 raids a week. This creates an environment where people want to be done with the raids as fast as possible.  If you are a new player and reach close to current content, you will struggle to find groups for the raids as people wont have ''time'' to teach you. Same applies if you fall behind the curve. The game induces a state of FOMO that cannot be really fixed in any way and will continue to be an issue as long as the current gold reward system exists. 

A brief word about issues outside of the game (RMT and botting). The in game store offers skins as well as cards and honing materials, you are also able to purchase gold directly. This makes gold have intrinsic real money value and as such botting and thus 3rd party RMT sites are rampant. Now while they have combated botting (look at the player charts) to a degree, the RMT is still pretty bad. You can get gold from 3rd party sites for half or one third of the in game price and the company behind the game seldom takes action against these RMT:ers. 

TLDR;
Overall, I cannot recommend the game. As a player playing since launch some of the issues behind the game are ''bearable'' but I could not ever recommend starting the game right now as a new player. It is sad because the combat and raids in the game are better than any other mmo I have played but the game outside of that is a broken ship that is slowly sinking into the abyss.",1707406463,265527.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5029239654541015
1599340,False,Great game ruined by poor management. Was a blast to play when it first came out and everyone was on enjoying content and playing together. The steam active players are probably around >50% bots. Saw maybe 3 actual players and over 100 bots in the 5 hours I played today after not playing since release. It's a serious problem as population of players is artificially replicated meaning not likely for there to be any server merging anytime soon unless Amazon Games and Smilegate do something about all the bots. If you have 3 other friends you can play with everytime youre on you can make it work as a 4 player coop game but other than that good luck to you as I haven't even been able to get into raids or dungeons without bots just shooting at random due to their scripting causing a severe lack of damage and ruining the fun of the game and increasing the already harsh difficulty of grinding for gear level.

1599340,False,"I have 8000+ hours played as of this review. I enjoy this game a lot but I caution new users to understand what they are getting into before trying this game. This game is a free-to-play game but with heavy pay-to-play elements in the endgame. I say pay-to-play instead of pay-to-win because you can build a character that is capable of clearing all the content in the game for free, getting a group to actually clear the content with you is the hardest aspect of the game.

If you're looking for a solo experience for the story and world exploration, then this game can keep you entertained for a few hundred hours! There were even revisions to the earlier raids to be soloable now there is no need to look for others. However, the bulk of the playerbase is now in T4 (1640+ ilevel, with the majority over 1680) so earlier content will be very barren and soloing is required. Once reaching that endgame there are new problem that arise.

New players will suffer a lot since when forming groups, many players will seek more experienced and beefier characters to allow into their groups. Conversely, forming a group as a new player will often be a ghost town lobby since others will not want to join you. This is especially relevant when certain content has a lopsided class distribution (too many damage dealers and too few supports at the top end). There have been mokoko bootcamp events added but it doesn't completely fix the issue (strong players take a single new player for basically a free ride while the newbie learns nothing).

If you're willing to put in the time and/or money, this game can be a lot of fun (the endgame raids are great). But the amount of information needed to digest to get to that point is quite substantial!",1707365884,495309.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

the good- 
+combat
+first time experience from start to end game was amazing (this is not the case anymore)
+skins
+progging raids on release

the bad-
-login rewards, daily and weekly rewards you get will absolutely not contribute to anything for your character, maybe for your alts (not really)

-mandatory to play 6 characters, if you want to keep up with latest content on one out of those characters

-cost of raising a character to end game is excessively high, and having to do this across your roster is extremely expensive and it will take ages for these characters to yield a return

-only vertical progression, which is very rng based, especially when there is gold sink after gold sink being introduced

-on western version, a 2nd end game vertical progression was announced before the first one was even released

-kr devs dont care about western version, which is evident by the latest patch releases

-rampant rmt presence

-on a new content release, hardly anyone does older raids, which makes it unnecessarily hard for new players or players that arent caught up to get their raids done 

-no one wants to play the video game, every player simply wants to get their ""homework"" done and move on, which fosters unwarranted gatekeeping 

-community is already small, and it is further divided into players with statics, and players who bus the raid

-forces new players to buy the bus, as ""hardcore"" players dont wanna deal with raid wipes or restarts so they will not entertain new players

-progressing is highly inaccessible unless you have friends who will invite you to the raids or who can help (literally giving you stuff)

-event and pass rewards are absolutely a big nothing burger, as they do not help your main character in any way, they are again best used on alts

-players will rmt themselves and gatekeep you out of raids, so you either spend money or buy a bus or sit in a lobby for 8hrs 

-when a new character releases, there is no way to play the character, unless you are ready to ditch one of your existing characters and spend all the gold/money again on this new char and progress it to end game

-just need to stress it again, that each character's investment cost is unreasonably high, while it is fine if you're playing only a single character, it is not when you have to do it on 5 other characters. and you have to have a 6 character roster, as the game design allows you to get gold from 6 characters a week. anyone that thinks, ""you dont HAVE to"" no, you're wrong, you have to. and it is not fomo, its just how the game is designed

if you wanna make it into groups then your character/s need to be quite over kill for the content you are applying, or else the lobby leader will simply pick one of the 20 terminally online players that apply over you. 

who are still playing-
~players who are too deep and dont wanna admit 
~sociopaths 
~players with a static
~players who bus on 10 characters and rmt their gold 
~deadbeat streamers, coz if they play something else they wont be relevant

who is it for-
~players with a group of friends 
~with no life
~sociopaths
~people who wanna spend unreasonable amount of money on gearing characters to only login to do raids and not grind for it

1599340,False,"I've been there when the game was released, quit for a few months and came back after Brelshaza's release. Currently I've got a roster of mostly supports with a 1640+ bard main.

[h3] Pros: [/h3]

- Island exploring: It was the most fun I've had at the very beginning of Lost Arks release. The in-game ocean is home to a lot of unique islands with quests on each of them. Doing those quests and exploring those islands would shower you with materials to upgrade your character. It was very rewarding and exciting to step off your boat and experience all these islands.

- Unique classes: I bet everyone will find a class that they will like in Lost Ark. Every class is divided into 2 different specializations, which creates even more variety.

- Combat: Feels impactful, is responsive, sound design is satisfying, particle effects are great.

- Raids: I can't say the Raids are bad, they are not. The cinematic shots are great, the transitions between phases are awesome, the soundtracks are epic. They are difficult at times but far from impossible. I've got my issues with Raids but it's not because of how the Raids present themselves.

- Skins: If you're into that, you can create some very beautiful characters. The skins can be quite skimpy, but there are a lot of tasteful options as well; whatever you are into. Create your perfect waifu.



[h3] Cons: [/h3]

- Raiding: What made me quit. Raids by itself are very cool and exciting... but after 2-3x that amazement turns into repetition, turns into brainless grind. Nobody cares about all the cinematic shots of the battlefield, cutscenes are being skipped and the epic OST just disabled in sound options. 
The mechanics of some raids are straight-up unfun. The fights can be very long and if one person of your 8-man raid messes up, it can mean a wipe to the whole party or sometimes only to parts of the raid group, so you die for another persons' mistake and watch while the others try to kill the boss alone. It breeds a toxic environment where new players are not able to join any experienced team without a certain roster level or achievements (for clearing that raid 10x for instance). You could say ""join a discord for new players and look for other new players"". Sure. But it requires a certain amount of effort which most people are not willing to put into a game that makes them not feel welcomed in the first place.
Even with a group of friends it's just not fun after some clears. You will do it every week again and again, on multiple characters, for gold and to gear up, but the fun of the raid is long gone at that point.
Supports are very rare at the endgame content to a point that support players will sell their ""services"" for gold.


-Balancing: Balance patches are not a bad thing. It is great that some classes, that lack damage output, get some buffs... but they are clearly missing the mark on those patches. A class that was considered trash before the patch might be DPS king right after. There is no balance in this game. Some classes deal way more damage than others and older, lower DPS classes just have to wait for a balance patch that makes them the lord of DPS, for a while. 
Powercreep is real here. You're not playing the new DPS overlord of the current patch? Have fun finding a group with a DPS class that is considered ""bad"" just because some content creator claimed that it was bad.
The community is incredibly elitist because more DMG in a Raid means less mechanics and less opportunities to wipe the group out, means faster clears, means faster gold earn, which is what it's all about for most players at this point.


Lost Ark got popular because there was no other new MMORPG out there for most people to get interested in and in the very beginning it was fun and exciting to explore the in-game world. 
I bet if you would ask most people that play Lost Ark right now, they would admit that they're just waiting for the next big MMORPG to release and they will quit. 
It's a very addicting game with nice graphics but the upgrade systems are luck-based, mobile game style systems with multiple currencies and ways to gamble your characterS up to higher powerlevels.

On a positive note, the combat in 'Lost Ark' is nothing short of phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed the engaging combat mechanics, the diversity of classes, and the overall design of the game and its maps.

Raids are unforgiving with several different bosses. A single boss fight can take up to 20+ minutes to finish, but a mistake from player can wipe the whole raid even at the very end and reset the boss. 

This can mean that even in weekly farm content it takes hours to kill a single boss. Random parties can be heavily impacted by gatekeeping, because no one wants to waste hours on old content.

1599340,False,"This was a fun and cool game that has been completely ruined. Not just by its systems but by its players too. Lost Ark will demand equally obscene amounts of time and money from you just to progress and experience things and it will never be enough.

The actual playing of the game is fun. It is awesome in fact. I like mowing down hundreds of monsters in a chaos dungeon. I like the guardian raids. I like the dungeons (usually)

What I DONT like is having to slave away on multiple characters to feed my main because you will require so many upgrade materials and the chances to succeed start to get so pitiful that you will get constantly screwed out of progressing. Those hours of playing through your daily tasks, dungeons, and guardian raids to get enough rocks to make yourself more powerful? All of it is gone and your time and effort was wasted. Down the drain with a single click. Thanks for playing. See you in a couple more days, idiot. Now you COULD pay Smilegate some bucks to get the stuff for some more attempts. Ya know, if you wanted...

The card system is straight-up trash. You'll end up with dozens or hundreds of duplicates but cannot seem to get the cards you need to complete set bonuses. People will gatekeep you from content over it so there's no ""just enjoy the game your own way bro"" angle here. You either have the gear/cards/game completion buffs to make people let you into groups or you do not.

Also getting some of these area completions is horrible and again, you HAVE to do it because it is connected to player power. It involves wandering and sailing around, one shotting enemies until you pick up enough trash items to add to your collection and then you can move on. Also, you run around giving NPC's presents until they like you enough to let you have another skill point or something. Boring, stupid, timegated, trash system.

1599340,False,"Henlo friends, I have about 400$ in this game, but I am f2p. It was mostly skins, but 200$ was spent getting one of 112 LOS30 cards.

I have 6200 hours in this game as a f2p pleb, and here is my review of why even after all of the positive changes we've had in the last 6 months, I cannot recommend it.

To begin, why do I have 6k+ hours? The boss fights. Legion raid fights are so, so fun, especially with friends (I rarely PUG, I typically do 90% of my content with a mix of the same people.) That...is about it. That's the only good part about Lost Ark.

Now, for the bad. The systems for progression.

To build a char, you need to hone it to the level of content you wish to participate in. I have 5 1600+ characters, 1614 artist being highest. It has taken me 8-12 characters worth of funneling and daily grinding for the last 24 months to achieve this as a f2p. Yes, there is a pity system, but you have to put a ridiculous amount of time/effort in just to hit thresholds, and I'm not even where I want to be. My goal was at least 1 1620, and I could have hit that if I ignored my alts but to hell with that, I chose the 'fun' route.

But that's not all! You need gear. What does gear entail? Lotteries. Multiple, lotteries. To start, you need an engraving stone. TL;DR there are 30 'nodes' on 3 lines, 10 each. 2 are positive, 1 are negative. You have at most a 75% chance to 'fill' a node, filling one is -10% for the next, failing is +10%. You are REQUIRED to get a 7/7/x (pray x is lower than 5), 9/5/x, or similar. My cheapest attempts at acquiring one took around 20k. My most expensive, on a single character, was 490k gold. (You can earn around 100k a week in-game if you do EVERYTHING on at least 6 1580+ characters, which only takes like a year+ of grinding so good luck.)

After your stone, you need accessories, the easy part. You farm some gold, save, then buy what you need from the market. If you're smart about it, you can get a 5x3+1 build (acceptable level) for under 150k with market tax (pheons, awful system.)

Now you can play your character! Unfortunately, you will be gatekept unless the quality on your gear is also pretty solid. Quality is a weighted lottery where the first 0-70% is about a 90% roll, and the remaining 30% you actually want/need to be in is about 10%. There is no pitying. Your chances cost raid tokens and raw gold. One of my characters purple quality weapons took 60k, another (my main dps) took 580k. This is just your weapon, and whereas quality tapping armor pieces is cheaper, there are 5 of them. Getting 70 quality is about a 3-4% roll, and anything above 70 starts going down even more (90% is less than 1% chance.) No, you do not 'need' this, but you aren't going to get into any groups to do content to get gold to try more unless you do.

Ok, NOW you can play the game! If...your bracelet is also 'ok.' This was a system introduced with Brelshaza, 13 months ago. You can grab a cheap one off the market, roll it until you get both your secondary stats and some extra health or something, and call it a day, but people gatekeep off of these, two. Bracelets are an additional accessory that costs pheons to buy, or you can pray your content gives you a few to tap a day. They can have 1-2 fixed slots (you typically look for your fixed secondary like swiftness, or crit, w/e) and 1-3 'open' slots. Bracelets can be rolled 4 times, that is it. 4. No more than 4, just, 4. Each time you roll your random open effects, you can choose to lock one if you get something spicy, but you only get 4 chances total. There are about 5 good options to roll for on a list of like 80, and no I'm not kidding. On top of that each option has green, blue purple and yellow quality. Congrats when you finally win but it's all blues, yes it's still good but it looks like garbage so weee. It has been 13 months, I have 5+ 1600s (and 2 more that are over 1580) and I only 2 bracelets that are considered 'ok' after throwing about 500k into buying some as well desperately trying to get one that was acceptable.

And now, for the coup de grace. We just recently got Voldis introduced here, and along with it, the elixir system. Week 2 of this content release, players began gatekeeping off of having a set bonus with elixirs. I can't tl;dr this so here we go.

There are purple and yellow quality elixirs. Purple can be a max of 4/4 (two level 4 effects) and yellows can be 5/5. Only your 5 armor pieces can have elixirs, so with purples you can have a max of 40 levels, and with yellows 50. A set bonus requires 35 total levels for the first part of your set, and 40 for the second. You can obtain purples at 1600, and yellows at 1620. Seems simple enough, right?

To 'cut' an elixir, you take your little vial of happiness and hope to the shiny mirror, and then you have 5 steps to choose 1 of 3 options from a pool of like 40. Like 10 of these are specific set bonuses, 10 are specific piece bonuses, and the remainder are general stat bonuses. They range from useless garbage like additional damage while you're by yourself, to raw attack/primary stats. In my experience, I have rolled my required set bonuses on my characters about 5% of the time. Then, you begin building it. Each elixir begins at 5 effects and will end with the 2 you will apply to your gear. Purples have 12 steps, yellows have 15. Each step gives 1 point to one of the 5 effects (only 2 of which you're going for) at random. You need to get 9 points in 1 effect to have a level 4 for purple (2 effects need 9 each to have a 4/4) and 10 points in 2 effects for yellows in a 5/5.

Each step also allows you to pick 1 of 3 random options from a pool of 40+ actions. These range from -2+2 to a random of the 5 effects, or they have you select one, shuffle all points, reducing points from 1 effect and adding them to another but both effects selected are random, huge effects like -4-+5 but then that option of 3 steps is just gone for the remainder of the cut, literally every elixir is different. Every step is a random one of like a million options, the effects they affect and the way they affect them is random, and...well you see where this is going. After 4 weeks of 5+ characters, I don't have a single viable set piece yet, and you need 2 to start.

But wait, there's more. If you spend about a years worth of setting alarms for timed events you probably won't get to complete because nobody does them anymore, then people may finally not assume you're a bot, or a whale, and you'll have lots of shiny adventure/game content completion! (Mostly a collectibles system but 90 times more annoying, and there are like 20 of them, I gave up on them over a year ago) Doing about 90% of this content to its max will give each of your characters like 2% more dmg/health and stuff. Congrats.

Oh, and cards. Don't have Light of Salvation 30? Not only are you missing 15% damage, you're still being gatekept. Took 18 months to finish my LoS30 and I finished pretty quickly (I did an extra 2-3 hours a week of 'abyss loops' which is just old dungeons you 1 shot for a like 2% chance at a card, praying its a card you need and not the 400th copy of one) compared to other guildies, some of which have finished in the last few weeks (almost 2 years of play time.) Also there's 3 other semi-necessary sets.

I have 6k+ hours in this game. I want to love it, because the combat is soooo, sooo so so fun, but the other 95% of the game is pure despair, and if I wasn't playing 12 hours a day I wouldn't even be able to experience it the way I do. Also I love my friends.

I still can't even do all of the content in the game, lol. Am I crying over the 900 lottery systems cuz I have bad luck? No. My luck has been above average, easily, and it's still actual trash. Even people with good luck are starting to hate it.

However, as with every game after some time, it just gets boring but still, you may want to come back after a few months or even years. In this case, it is impossible. 
My main character has gear level 1400 so it is mid-game and I cannot find any party to do raids or dungeons etc. It is basically a scam, there is no way that over 30 thousand people are playing because there is no one doing any end-game content. Yes, you can find more probably a party when your gear level is 1600 but I could not even reach it because there is no one to play with. You have to complete dungeons or raids to gain resources needed for the update of your gear but how can you do it if there is no one to defeat a boss with you, being even worse when you play support. Gatekeeping is from another planet. I've never seen such discouragement from others, even though the community has shrunk so much still they will not want to waste time on you. Chat is dead, early regions are empty and even the main cities are quiet with characters staying still for hours. 
I love this game and I could have not been more disappointed after coming back after a year and seeing such a regression which makes a game unplayable. It is only worth playing if you are over 1600 gear but still, it is a challenge to find a party. Such a pity to see a game that took me hours stepping so low and not implementing any new changes to make it more new player-friendly or less p2w.

1599340,True,"Hot characters, flashy raids, and interesting lore. Some of the negative feedback that I saw in the reviews mentioned gatekeeping of raids and a pay-to-win (P2W) system, so let me share my perspective on them.

Gatekeeping of raids: If you join an active guild and put in the effort to find the right people to play with, they will raid with any class you have. If you prefer not to be friends with other gamers, you can create your own raid lobby and label it accordingly, such as 'learning party' if you are just starting out or 'hw party' if you are well-experienced. You might be surprised by how many people are waiting to join you.

P2W: Frequent events, shops, and daily prizes provide a good amount for you to level up. While it might take a while, the progression is meant to be more like a 'stroll in the park.' Appreciate the quests and the storyline, farm some mokokos, and work on collecting items and enjoy the game fully.

Other than some toxic players ruining the raid, I've met really good friends through this game who are miles away from me. The new update with the Breaker is coming out soon and it will have lots of modifications to players needs and I am here for it.

1599340,True,"So, Lost Ark, it's like a free buffet of mildly intriguing quests that stretch on for centuries. Picture this: the combat is so flashy, it's like the game's classes took a crash course in fireworks. Facing the bosses is like entering a dance-off with intense moves that make you feel alive.

But here's the rub. It's got some issues, and not just the regular ""oops, spilled coffee on my keyboard"" kind. We're talking a pay-to-win model, performance hiccups that hit more frequently than your annoying neighbor's bass-heavy music, and bots running around like they own the place. Oh, and let's not forget that 90% of the game feels like a ghost town, with everyone crowding in the VIP section of endgame and seasonal event zones.

Then there's this thing called ""Powerpass,"" a backstage pass to catapult you straight to the endgame party. Sounds cool, right? Not when you realize there's this strict meta dictating what your character should wear and what special effects they should be flexing. It's like a fashion show with no room for creativity.

And don't get me started on the card system. It's like playing poker with a deck stacked against you. There's a so-called ""best"" stat, and if you dare to be different, prepare for the cold shoulder from endgame groups and a front-row seat to the community's toxic drama.

That said... its still the same Lost Ark with the same issues... Even with Express events to help you progress you still hit a Gold or Resource wall roughly 1 hour after starting the game... If you have good RNG maybe you unlock 2 - 3 solo raids worth of content.. If you have bad RNG the game immediately blocks and go farm dated content for super minimum amounts of gold... to click the RNG upgrade button a few more times... If your RNG is still bad... you log off the game and come back next week to do it again.....

Paradise is really just a Roguelike Chaos Dungeon... you 1 shot mobs for hours, fight a mini boss with next to no mechanics... and you do this ALOT... for a long time..... its really boring....

Game is juuussttt difficult enough that 90% of the playerbase is bad at it... Which has created a gatekeeping community....
Game is extremely fun.... but if your only goal is power/vertical content... dont play this game... the gatekeeping is a timesink.. you will get 9 bad parties that take 20 min to form due to a support shortage...  on party 10 you just disband after 1 pull because not every player is a pro who has cleared the boss 100 times already. 

Horizontal content is 100% pointless. ALOT of features or things are timegated (like raid materials or stronghold progress) 

The upgrade system is generic KR Gatcha Grindfest... You will be forced to play this game like a full time job with 6 Alts just to afford RNG clicking the upgrade button.... The game in no way shape or form respects the players time....

Some players will get a certain gear score (1610ish) by only failing about 20 times and spending 5k gold. MOST other players will spend 500,000 gold and 250 fails for the same progress... which will take hundreds of hours of farming boring repetitive content to get the mats/gold for that amount of clicking.


TL:DR. Myself and a friend rolled brand new on the fresh start servers... we partied thru the same content, cleared everything available. we did this for 4 weeks straight. At the end of the work. I was Gear Score 1584 he was gear score 1612.

This is not only affecting and encouraging user behavior to use third party RMT but also affecting their sales because players gets almost half or less of what third party RMT sites offers with 3 days limit to use the gold they bought with no actual reward/mileage system. Not to mention their 'slap on the wrist' policy on third party RMT service users which encourages the users to use third party RMT services that is 'instant' and twice or more cost efficient.

Moreover all the in game resource package that is being sold in game that is supposed to help with character progression are terribly designed and waste of money which is exactly opposite of the similar package in other games. It is almost embarrassing to see those value of resources being sold which almost feel like a bait for a new users who is not aware of values of resources yet. Not only these packages that're always on the shop has disastrous value but also special packages such as 'Black Friday Deal' is not appealing at all and base price are too expensive.

There is issue of no new follow up updates on and not releasing Legendary Skin ( Yoz's Jar) Season 3..
Certain skins that was intended to be free gift to players in original version being sold in cash shop.
Recent Neria's Wardrobe skins only available with expensive package bundle which contradicts the concept of Neria's Wardrobe itself.
They only sell character selection page wallpaper in packages - which is understandable - but usually $50+ packages. But, the real problem is more than half of the Character Selection Wallpapers' special background music are bugged and doesn't play. Even the latest package which is $50 is bugged and does not play the special background music player paid for. They know about this issue yet does not mention in any major patch or in known issue when clients are not getting what they've paid for for god knows how long - at least several months by now at least.. and many more.

I want them to properly reward and give more advantages for players to buy gold in game and not feeling like we are forced to donate to AGS for half of the value with 3 day wait time. Because bots technically can't be 100% eliminated nor players can't be control with punishment, use positive reinforcement to make players want to spend legitimately and reduce bot and RMT at the same time in long run. At the moment AGS is not only ""slightly"" punishing to players using RMT - which is clear that it is not effective at all - but also punishing legitimate users with all the limitation and removal of reward that players know that they could've gotten.
Almost in all cases, you don't need to buy gold if it's not an instant use: such as buying from auction house, buying resources, honing your equipment. There is no use case for buying gold three days ahead.
IF PLAYER BUYS GOLD 3 DAYS AHEAD, IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS 3 DAY LIMIT.
There is no any other reason.

Having no PROPER - not the stupid Amethyst Shard that has 0 appealing item and only obtainable with Yoz's Jar except monthly drip feed from Amazon Prime -  mileage system like in original version on buying Royal Crystal and 3 day limit on gold bought legitimately is single big reason why there is way less revenue is being earned and bot + RMT which leads to gold price inflation -> player quitting, etc.",1702739308,271552.0,True,False,False,5,0,0.5461578369140625

1599340,True,"Açıkçası Lost Ark bugüne kadar oynadığım en keyifli MMO'lardan biri. Özellikle savaş sistemi ve sınıf çeşitliliği gerçekten tatmin edici. Zor raidler içeren bir MMO da arıyorsanız sizin için biçilmiş kaftan. Ayrıca kamera açısı doğru kişiler için MMO'ya yeni bir soluk katacaktır. Zor ve eğlenceli raidleri tatmin edici savaş sistemiyle birleştirince, arkadaşlarınızla geçireceğiniz keyifli saatler sizi bekliyor.

Ancak tabii her oyunda olduğu gibi Lost Ark'ı da oynamadan önce bilmeniz gereken zorlukları ve eksikleri de var. Bunlardan başlıca olanları şunlar:

- Birçok ilerleme sisteminin her ne kadar pity sistemi de olsa şansa dayalı olması,
- Özellikle yalnız oynamayı seven veya diğer oyuncularla iletişime girip bir guilde katılmayı düşünmeyen bir oyuncuysanız; az önce belirttiği zor ve eğlenceli raidler sizin için bir kâbusa dönüşecektir. Bir grubunuz veya guildiniz yoksa özellikle yeni gelen raidleri akıcı bir şekilde yapmak çok yorucu oluyor.
- PVP sistemi her ne kadar ilk bakışta eğlenceli gelse de geliştiriciler uzun zamandır PVP ile ilgilenmiyor ve oynayan çok az. PVP odaklı bir oyun arayan birini kesinlikle tatmin etmez.
- Sürekli olarak grind yapabileceğiniz bir raid veya zanaat sistemi yok. Haftalık raid yapabileceğiniz karakter sayısı 6 ve bu karakterlerle üçer adet raid yapabiliyorsunuz. Bazı oyunlardaki gibi oturup saatlerce aynı içeriği yapmanız ya mümkün olmuyor yada size bir şey kazandırmıyor.
- Tek bir karaktere odaklanarak oynayanlar için haftalık yapılacak şey çok limitli, üstte belirttiğim nedenden ötürü. Buda sizi ana karakterin yanında başka karakterler oynamaya teşvik ediyor. Karakter çeşitliliğini de göz önüne alınca bu iyi de olabilir, kötü de olabilir.

Üstte belirttiğim durumlar sizin için önemli değilse veya ilerde bu durumlar düzelirse, Lost Ark'ı kesinlikle oynamanızı tavsiye ederim.",1702207498,455964.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1599340,True,"Lost Ark is a captivating MMORPG that has managed to captivate me with its stunning visuals, dynamic combat, and expansive world. It's a game that effortlessly draws you into its rich lore and keeps you invested in the journey through Arkesia.

Visually, Lost Ark is a feast for the eyes. The detailed environments, diverse landscapes, and spell effects contribute to a visually stunning experience. The graphics are a definite highlight, immersing players in a world that feels alive and vibrant.

The combat system is where Lost Ark truly shines. The variety of classes and their unique abilities make gameplay dynamic and engaging. The ability to customize skills allows for a personalized playstyle, and the challenging encounters keep you on your toes. The balance between solo and group content adds depth to the overall experience.

Exploration is a key aspect of Lost Ark, and the vast world is filled with secrets to uncover. The seamless transition between land and sea exploration adds a layer of excitement to the adventure. However, while the world is expansive, some areas could benefit from more varied content to keep exploration consistently engaging.

The progression system is well-designed, offering a mix of quests, dungeons, and raids. The game provides a sense of accomplishment as you progress, and the social features encourage interaction with the community. The multiplayer aspects, from dungeons to PvP, add an extra dimension to the gameplay.

Despite its many strengths, Lost Ark isn't without its flaws. The game could benefit from more optimization, as some areas suffer from performance issues. Additionally, while the quest variety is good, a bit more diversity in mission objectives could enhance the overall experience.

1599340,True,"[h1]Overall[/h1]
This game is long-term game. 
You definitely would have to invest a some amount of time and consistency to play for fun.
(not like 100 hours or 300 hours)

It does require pretty expensive rig. 
Unlike League of Legends, and WOW, this game has a lot of in-game features and particles to render.
You may be required a computer with high specifications for playable quality.

[h1]Currency[/h1]
After spending around a couple hundreds of dollars (mostly Ark-pass, monthly buffs, and skins), I can tell this game is clearly playable as F2P. 
It's your choice to spend an amount of money to become stronger quick. 
However, in the end, everyone will be in a similar level (unless you decided to dump a car in it).

[h1]Newcomers[/h1]
For newcomers, I would recommend start playing whenever there is a major event (such as Super Mokoko Express, etc.).
and try enjoying the stories (some of them are actually impressive).
I personally better recommend to play with friend who's been playing for quite awhile.

*PLEASE*
If you have any question while playing game, google it, ask in-game chat, or post question in the official LostArk Discord server.

too much monetization on every single aspect of the game from achievments to progressions not a single part of the game you cant p2w

update nov 2024:
still the same but p2w is crazier than ever, also game still takes 5mins to load in 2024...

update march 2025:
rmt is legal now, if you get caught you will only get negative gold thats maybe 10% of what you rmted example: saturn

chaos botting for 1 year+ = (fake perma ban) 14days and then mass unbanned everyone great job AGS. all the people unbanned just sold their gems for real cash or moved them to alt accs truly awe inspiring. example: ags latest statement on botting bans.

bussing advert ban still being circumvented with cinema and password lobbys AGS cant even protect their tos for 1 month. example: open party finder.

1599340,False,"Day 1 player here. The game has changed quite a lot (especially the legion raids). 

If you have a full-time job (40 hrs/week) I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to you, especially if you reach the end-game (legion raids). You also have to deal with the dailies like chaos dungeons and guardian raids. 
If you can manage your time, enjoy.


[h2] Legion Raids [/h2]
Learning legion raid mechanics WILL take you time, depending on how quick you can learn. You should know that messing up a mechanic will most likely cause the entire raid party to die as a consequence. Can you take that pressure in your head? If you can, go ahead and install. What I'm trying to say is that you need a strong mind and thick skin if you want to participate in Lost Ark's endgame. You'll probably die. Like, alot of times. It's fine, it's normal - you're learning. But some other people might not share the same opinion. That's just how it is. Fortunately there's online discord raid groups that specifically aim to teach and guide you how to beat the legion raid. 


[h2] Money $? [/h2]
You can get by the game without burning cash. However, if you're a freak who likes to see numbers going up you're probably going to be tempted to drop cash on stuff like getting perfect engravings for example. Just keep in mind it adds up..An argument for it is because if you're playing a DPS class, the extra damage would actually matter in terms of clearing legion raids when time matters. It's true. You could actually skip a raid boss' annoying attack patterns if you just mow it down like grass on a lawn. But, a counterpoint to that is just play better, l0l (also true)

Neither point is wrong. It's really your choice.


[h2] Gear Progression [/h2]
Enhancing gear will be a roadblock. It's entirely possible to be tempted to burning cash to meet item level requirements. Beware. 


[h2] Dailies [/h2]
Your dailies (after hitting lv. 50) will consist of clearing chaos dungeons and/or guardian raids, and some Una Tasks.
Nothing complicated. Takes about 20-30 minutes. You can choose not to do them and let them stack up via rest bonus automatically and then take care of them some other day.


[h2] Alternate Characters [/h2]
Where the spaghetti gets mixed. You can choose to commit to only one character class (totally fine!), or you can get real freaky and have multiple other different character classes in your account. Or, they can all be the same class (why?).
Keep in mind that doing dailies is NOT shared account wide. It's per character. That 20-30 min usually spent doing dailies can easily turn into a 1 hour+ ritual instead, depending on how many alt characters you tolerate.


[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
Going back to my intro, if you're on a full-time job 40/hrs a week, I can't really recommend this game to you, on the principle of time. Sure, if you just commit to only one character, that's fine - but if you want to participate in Legion Raids you're almost guaranteed to dedicate a significant chunk of your day to learning how to clear the raid. Currently, there's 5 Legion Raids released. Remember, you have to remember each legion raid's mechanics. That's not a simple ask for anyone whose just downloading the game for the very first time in their lifetime.
 
If you can fulfill that ask and can manage your time, enjoy. The game has some nice soundtracks. It's got nice visuals. If you like lore, you may find some plot points memeable.

1599340,False,"2025 Update

Better, but still too much. The initial onboarding experience for a new character is a little bit better, but the amount of items and inventory management you have to do every 2 minutes is insane. I spent more time figuring out what items did and where to put them, than i did actually fighting. You spend so much time doing stuff other than fighting. Combat is the best part of their game but they keep making the mistake of giving it to you 5 minutes at a time spread apart by monotonous and boring item management and other not so interesting tasks. But that isnt the biggest problem. After all these years, its still gold. The inflated gold costs to progress, the snail pace of all forms of progression systems, and instead of improving it, they add more systems thinking it will solve the issue, but it doesnt. Instead you are left with 400 systems of progression, all more confusing than the next in the end to still need grind for 6 months to get to relevant content. It's a joke.
The amount of gold I need to progress is absurd and the fact that the prices for real money currency is so high, makes it worse. It's quite literally hundreds of dollars for very very minor upgrades if you chose to go that route. 

Also, this idea of handing new players/characters thousands of levels, items, and gear, it ruins the experience in my opinion. As a former player, i was able to slowly work my way at it. As a new player, i would have uninstalled. There is just way too much thrown at you and all the fun content becomes immediately irrelevant instead of them making the progression more enjoyable.

The game is fun when you actually do any combat, but its a sad excuse of a product.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2024 Update

I tried to get back into the game after about a 2 year hiatus. The game is even less accessible than ever. Not only do I have LITERALLY hundreds of notifications icons everywhere, the server merges causes all your stash, characters and anything related(like cards etc.) to be put into a universal storage for you to sort out in order to get back to what you were doing before you left. About 5 hours later, I still have notification icons, I still dont know where half my stuff is or went, there are tons of new systems, pop ups and things that I have no idea what they do with zero introduction to them, and to make it all worse, gold is so inflated, that even buying the crystals with gold is absolutely rediculous. 

I wanted to come back during an express event, thinking it would be like the old ones from when I played that you can level a new character up to a decent item level to get going into the more end game activities, but instead the express is now limited to like a very high item level to even start it, causing me to have no direction in my return with a new character. 10 hours into the game, and I still have no idea what im doing, I have no sense of how to progress anymore(because so much has changed) and in some ways, the grind feels even longer than it did before just to get to a third of the spot I was at on my main character. 

It feels really bad because I've been thinking about this game for a few weeks now. But after today, I just cant do it. It's way too convoluted, which is a real shame. 

Not very friendly for returning players. 
-----------------------------------------------------------


An amazing game plagued by its own greed and miscommunication with, arguably, the best combat in any mmo (or most games to date for that matter). Raids unmatched aswell. But this game also has so many flaws, too many of which I will not talk about as you can see them from the other comments. But my main issue with the game - NEEDING atleast 6 characters that you play DAILY to make progress on your main. 

I have ALOT of time to game, but spending 20hrs a day to complete my dailies for all characters just to get a few more gear rolls on my main(and fail them) is horrible game design. I just cant get myself to play this game because the time investment is so beyond crazy. I do not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have atleast 15 hours a day to play. Anything under than and you will quickly start to fall behind content which eventually leads you to being locked out because of toxicity and frankly, just a pitiful gearscore. Sad truth. 

People will say that isn't true, but they aren't being genuine or they just havent played enough to really see what the struggle is to push yourself to an ilvl that is within the new content. Something I always say when comparing this game to other MMOs, is that most MMOs release content that has you play the content in order to get gear to push up your item level, in this game you have to push up your item level to play new content. It's a little backwards and just feels frustrating to play when combined with how much effort is needed to make the tiniest of progress. 

It is quite literally impossible to play this game with only 1 character to progress. You can try to prove me wrong, but you wont and unfortunately its only your time to waste, because I have already wasted mine.

I can forgive basically any other choice/decision they have in this game, except for that one. I just cant do it, its way too much. It's sad too because I often find myself wanting to play, but its just way too demanding.",1699935041,61246.0,True,False,False,8,0,0.5494696497917175

Like others have noted the early and mid game is pretty fun and if you want to play to enjoy the story please do so, just be aware that the end game is not so forgiving especially if you do not know what you are doing.  Current players will most likely have high expectations if you are end game.

1599340,True,"This game has many problems, but also good things. overall i'd still recommend it compared to the sea of crap out there.

THE BAD: 
-leveling sucks, mindnumbingly boring quests and ALOT of them. it doesnt end when u hit max lvl, u have to do more for each zone thats ever been released in human history. and because the steam version of the game was released straight to tier 3, u have to do quests for multiple ""small expansions"" all at once. Imagine playing something like WoW and having to do quests from 3 expansions at once.

-horizontal progression sux - while most are optional some arent. certain skill runes that make ur class mechanics come together and feel good to play are locked behind LONG grinds of boring horizontal content.

-new/returning player gatekeeping -  first i disagree with all the people saying u need to p2w to keep up with current content. if you have been playing a few chars the whole time you should be able to funnel resources to your main and have ur main ready for the highest tier stuff. however, trying to catchup to current content for a new player or a returning player is absolutely insurmountable, even with massive p2w you'd still have to do the unbearable quest grind.

-character design - ya they suck. a game with this level of graphical detail have worse looking characters than something like dungeon fighter online. 

THE GOOD:
-PvE combat is very satisfying and generally well designed. valtan progression was probably the most fun i've had in any raid in any game. the difficulty is sufficiently challenging to be fun, but also laid back enough to not be particularly tiring. 

-daily grind is not that bad. i see alot of people complain about this, but its really just a fomo thing. u can do dailies once every 3 days and get 66% of the return. if u have 6 active characters, thats 2 characters of dailies per day. takes about 30minutes. yes its repetitive, but its really not that bad.

conclusion:
Lost ark has many problems, but endgame pve content alone was worth it for me

1599340,False,"Holy shit what a stockholm syndrome of a game, countless hours ""enjoyed"" in a productive manner, so what better than channeling all that energy into an entirely productive review. That being said, since most aspects of this game seemed to have been expertly designed by a loose AI with about as much chance to succeed as the honing attempts at gear you actually care about, i will let the rest of this next segment be written by Chat GPT instead.

""Oh, Lost Ark, where do I even begin with this gem of a game? It's almost impressive how a title can manage to simultaneously infuriate and disappoint its player base. If you're looking for an MMORPG that's a masterclass in frustration, this is the one for you.

First and foremost, the game excels in wasting your time. It's like the developers sat down and said, ""How can we make players spend hours on the most mundane tasks?"" Congratulations, you've succeeded. You'll find yourself grinding for hours to get the tiniest bit of progress, and let's not even talk about the drop rates. It's almost as if they want you to throw your keyboard out the window.

And speaking of the grind, let's not forget about the mind-numbingly boring quests. You'll be tasked with rescuing some generic NPC's cat, or collecting a ridiculous number of seemingly pointless items, all while the story remains about as engaging as watching paint dry. It's almost as if they hired a team of writers who failed to create anything remotely interesting.

The user interface? It's like they asked a bunch of preschoolers to design it. Good luck trying to find anything or make sense of the cluttered mess. The navigation is a puzzle in itself, and you'll spend more time clicking through menus than actually playing the game.

The graphics, while not the worst, are far from impressive. It's like watching a mid-2000s cartoon with some added sparkle. And don't even get me started on the character animations; they're stiff and lifeless, making your hero feel more like a cardboard cutout than a legendary warrior.

But don't worry, if you're willing to spend a small fortune on microtransactions, you can unlock some cosmetics that make your character look slightly less terrible. Who doesn't want to pay real money to make their in-game avatar look just a tad more presentable?

In conclusion, Lost Ark is a prime example of how not to make an MMORPG. If you enjoy torturing yourself with endless grinding, infuriating quests, and a UI that feels like it was designed by a blindfolded monkey, this is the game for you. For the rest of us, there are far better ways to spend our time. Good luck, adventurers, you're going to need it.""

Fuuuck me what a dogshit waste of time i thoroughly enjoyed.. If for some reason you did not agree or enjoy this review, i urge you to read it from the very beginning for a 5% chance of it being upgraded to one you might like a little better or spend not only time, but a bit of your money too, to have an additional 5% of the outcome being changed, thank you! :)",1697960537,28538.0,True,False,False,8,4,0.5461204648017883

1599340,True,"[h1]Simple : One of the absolute best MMO atm.[/h1]

Yes there is a LOT of problems with the game.
But you can play like 300+ hours without encountering them.

The game is way better now than when it launched, honing rate, catch up mechanics etc... 

Don't try to tryhard this game it's a waste of time, take your time, enjoy the game.

But if you want to know what's good and what are the problems i'll make a list with some of them.

[b]Pros :[/b]
- Gameplay : 99/10 
- Boss, Raid and group content : 10/10
- Game is challenging.
- Horizontal content, even if i hate it a lot of ppl love it.
- Cinematics : 9/10

[b]Cons :[/b]
- RNG system, like all corean game it's based on RNG. But it's only problematic at higher level.
- English VA is cringe.
- Grinding : Corean/10
- P2W, it cost a lot of money (70k to P2W) but P2W donc by you skill, only MVP, if you are bad you will fail boss mechanics anyway and make all your group die.

[b]Neutral[/b]
- Story : 5/10 not the best one but there is some smaller story that are insane.
I really like the story but a lot of ppl think it's mid.
- You need Alt character, it's not as bad as it was at the start, but you still need multiple characters.
- Meta slave and gate keeping, you need to build your character correctly or you will be gate keep.


I probably missed a lot of things, but for a F2P it's a very good game. 
If you want to be the best player, rush end game and do progress in top guild .. i hope you have 15h per day to spend on the game or a lot of money, because you will not success.

1599340,True,"Lost ark is an incredible game, with outstanding gameplay, animations and sounds.
This game will drain your time, but it is up to you how much of your time you want to spend, your time can be spent on a countless amount of activities the game has to offer, trying to do everything the game has to offer will seem impossible as it requires an astounding amount of time, over-time you will get closer and closer to finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and you will be able to complete all the game has to offer in terms of collectables, however you will still find things to do in this game, content supply in this game is just incredible.

I personally would not classify this game as pay2win but rather pay2skip, you can achieve the same relative amount of content progress being a free to play player as a person who is engaging in a lot of micro-transactions, bear in mind that the amount you have to pay AGS and SG to ""skip"" is huge which means way less people do it.

Most of the negative reviews are due to a ""toxic community"" which I myself have not experienced much of, only a couple of times, I think people getting annoyed at comments from other people may just have a low self-confidence. If you have a problem with a ""toxic community"" join/create semi-learning lobbies, or learning lobbies until you feel confident with content you would like to progress:)
It is foreseeable that if you join a lobby with ""FAST CLEAR"" ""RE-CLEAR"" without sufficient knowledge of the content you are going to get flamed for constantly failing mechanics which you should know prior to joining the lobby.

The game is very friendly to coming back players, it gives you many events, catch-up mechanics, and powerpasses to boost a character of your choice, so if you are considering coming back, DO IT!

Nevertheless if you have never given this game a try, do so, this game offers an incredible experience that other games are not able to offer on the same level, the game is constantly being updated and getting better as time goes on as the development team really does want to see the game be successful and it is not just about monetary gain.

If Lost Ark was changed to a system that removed systems that were considered pay to win, such as gear honing, card sets and engravings, and none of it's content changed, it would be an unparalleled success in the Action RPG space even if launched today. The classes and how they are designed to allow for skill expression and mastery - large variety of Interesting and unique dungeons, memorable boss fights and story moments. They have normal mode encounters that can rival even the most interesting pinnacle bosses content in Path of Exile or in Diablo 3 or 4. If Lost Ark released as a buy to play package, and that package removed or massively overhauled Honing, and the card system was a system that gave you all the sets just for playing through the game it would be a 10/10.

However, since this is not a pure ARPG but an ARPG MMO, there are systems in place that will prevent the normal gamer from reaching, let alone completing this content in a reasonable amount of time as the game must limit your progress to ensure you cannot reach end game without encountering a few design decisions created to remove resources from the player economy and slow down progression.

The Jump Server program is the first time this game will come close to be Free to play friendly in a while, as the items that are given could get you to a place where a new player can start and within a few days  be able to attempt the end game raids and other pinnacle content. 

Do not play this game if you are vulnerable to predatory monetization practices as power is sold in the cash shop. RNG mechanics like The Card System and honing mechanics turn this game from a fun sandbox adventure to a casino. As it is not uncommon to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this game in some regions.

1599340,True,"Very enjoyable game play.

The game itself is just fun to play. The classes are fun, optimizing your builds are fun, learning the raids are fun and conquering the raids are fun. 

I think if you're just slightly interested into MMOs or you took a look at the combat and it piqued your interest. Give it a try, there's currently a ""jump start"" server going on right now that lets you ""jump"" to the end game and play all the cool raids without having to do all the tedious questing. If you complete two or three legions raids and find that it's just not for you, then unfortunately this game has nothing else for you. But to those who enjoy raiding and exciting combat, I highly recommend this game. 

Couple tips for starting players: 
- use lostark.nexus to find out more information about your build 
- ask questions, many of which can be answered through various discords or other sub-communities

Like I said, this game can be very overwhelming at first. If you aren't the kind of person who doesn't want to spend extra time outside of the game figuring out ways to optimize your game play (watching raid guides, watching class guides), then all I can really say is to just try the legion raids before you take your leave.

1599340,True,"[b]In overall, the game's main audience are ""hardcore gamers"", as cringe as it sounds and there is nothing wrong with that. Moment to moment gameplay is as good as it gets, and for me, the biggest win. It's the best feeling game I've ever played.[/b]

[b]Short version:[/b] I can recommend the game to anyone, who likes really, REALLY good combat mechanics, especially in ARPGs. Coming from league (which feels amazing to play and yes it's not an ARPG) I can wholeheartedly say, that this game feels even better. The progression feels extremely meaningful and it's a great linear to exponential curve towards the current endgame. Once you understand the systems ingame, it's a joy to tinker around, eventough you will most likely stick to your meta builds. Do not expect to meet anyone along your early game journey (level 1-50 and until ilvl 1250, probably 1430 at the time of this writing), the endgame content is truly peak content in general gaming terms.

[b]General advice to beginners:[/b] You're new to the game? Look, it's a korean p2w game, you have to do your research. This is not your fault, it's just how the core game is designed. Alot of its problems stems from being a p2w game. I would've gladly paid a monthly fee to have a much better game experience, but we can't change that, can we. During your leveling 1-50 hours enjoy the game, if you have a friend to bring along, that'll be great. Nothing really matters, equip whatever comes along until you reach ilvl 1250 currently. Most dungeons will be a solo experience (at least the game gives you the option of doing that) since the game lacks players. Sadly don't expect to meet people until the endgame, where the grind really begins. Join a relevant discord community (People will gladly help you out there to find groups for raids, guardians and all other content. You will receive help for building your character and most importantly, you will find a community that is mostly nice in comparison to the toxic moshpit ingame. Again, not your fault you gotta do this, but I can wholeheartedly recommend this after playing for almost a year without it. It's a night and day difference. You might also make some friends along the way. Take whatever the game throws at you and store it until you understand the concept of them. We haven't touched gems or engravings until it was absolutely necessary for example. And why not touch them? Remember, it's f2p p2w, use the free ressources you get and don't waste them. Until you feel comfortable with the mechanics and intricacies at least. If you don't know what to do with something, do some google research and maybe ask on discord before you ""waste"" it. Get your daily login bonuses. The game throws alot at you as a f2p and it can feel overwhelming. Just store it and use it whenever you feel ready for it. That's how we played and honestly we didn't pay for anything except for the occasional Lost Ark Pass (comparable to any battle pass). Take it step by step and most systems will make sense. And just make sure to ask, we've all been there and it will save you some frustration. The game could do this better, but it is what it is. For class build guides I can recommened the community guides (just google ""lost ark community guide for XXXX class"") and some Google Doc should pop up (or something with a .nexus domain).

[b]Our experience:[/b]
I keep talking about ""us"" - I'm married, 30yo, playing this game exclusively with my wife since launch. We've taken a break from October 2022 to June 2023 due to burning out ingame. This game demands alot of your time- over time. We used to play 6 characters to maximize gold income, but doing all those daily chores, all those weeklies, all those raids every week, all that content- just took too much time and wasn't fun anymore. However, after half a year of trying a bunch of other MMO(RPG)'s, we came back, because honestly they all suck aswell. At least in gameplay terms. It's relevant that I'm married because I'm socially ""maxed out"" already, I don't feel the need for socializing much and MMO's have their focus (usually) less on gameplay and more on social features. Lost Ark however, has the priorities exactly right for us: It's all about the game(play). The lore is fine, it has its momoments, but it's extremely cliché and forgettable for the most part. The raids (with their respective difficulties) are by far the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced in gaming- ever. I've had some clutch matches in league, that also drops the good hormones, but finally making a raid with a bunch of randoms that have been struggling aswell for days- now that's absolutely peak gaming right there. Especially if you're all at the same level, mostly clueless and trying to just make it. This is the most fun part of the game.

Less fun is repeating exactly that. I felt alot of times that those kinds of content shouldn't be repeatable so often and my review would've been very different half a year ago- which brings me to the current changes: I'm extremely happy about the recent changes. The developers have already halved the homework for the most part, are actively working on the repetitiveness of the game and are already removing parts of the game, that shouldn't be in there and are turning some raids into biweekly content, which is VERY GOOD. They gotta work on content and alternative routes for people that aren't into hardcore raiding (however this is a raid focused game- what are you doing here? Trying to fish your way into the endgame?). The thing is IF you cut the annoying parts out of the game and remove most p2w f2p elements, there's not much ""game"" left. If you don't do your daily chores and less raids and only have one character- what is left in the game? Not much. There's alot of potential for other activities and they're mostly fleshed out (e.g. wood cutting was even fun for us? Up to 4 people can fell a tree wtf??? There's even special animations for that and everything? And it's mostly IRRELEVANT and UNDERUTILIZED???), however they lack purpose. Alot of activities in this game lack significant purpose.

This game is such a double edged sword in every way: The fact, that the game is somewhat forcing you into playing more than 1 character, which is ass for some, but for me I find it fun and refreshing to play and try out different classes, understand how they work and understand why they do certain things in raids. Play a support class, ACTUALLY understand how they work instead of guessing. The game is SO difficult and raid focused, yet only BECAUSE of this it feels satisfying to finish one, yet so frustrating to repeat it often. If they would split their attention to other things, would that result in mediocre raids? I could name a ton of other things, but these are two important things to us.

[i]Great core gameplay, mediocre plot, somewhat complicated systems (just because there are many, none of them are particularly complex), mostly impatient ingame playerbase, reliance on outside sources and a big, fun to some, unfun to others, grindy game.[/i]

This game has great graphics and gameplay to suck you in, but be warned as it uses basically every trick in the book to psychologically trick you into keep playing and spending money on the game.

The game will intentionally create moments where you want to keep playing but can't unless you spend a few bucks on the cash shop to get another raid run in for the week, or maybe just 10 bucks to gamble for that gear upgrade you've been grinding for. After all, you sunk the cost of 10 hours of gameplay only to get bad luck and never hit your roll, right? You deserve this gear upgrade its ok to spend just 5-10 dollars here, and then another 5-10 there.

And oh wow, you've been spending 2 hours a day for the past month? That's a lot of time as well. Let's sunk cost fallacy this situation and make a second character to help optimize your grind further. You might as well spend 50 dollars on a new costume in the shop too. And oh don't forget another one for your second character. And another set of gachas to gear up your second character. Wait everyone else has 6? Man I need to catch up... here's another 200 Smilegate. Thanks for making such a great game that I've spent hundreds of hours on! Nevermind that the 100s of hours were basically just daily chores...

The game isnt new player friendly, but its a problem developers are aware of and are working very hard, and effectively to tackle, there have been dozens of updates to help fresh, or returning players catch up and they have all been very meaningful. The games grindy, its an MMO, but developers understand that time is valuable and are looking forward with lots of updates to give you time back from dailies, and when you do end up doing them, they feel more rewarding. My advice if your picking up this game is to try and find a guild/community on your server. A lot of veteran players are nice and will help you and give you advice aswell as give u tips for raids and gear progression. If you want to play solo, i suggest using your una's weekly gold to buy ""busses"" from other players for raids and then try to learn from watching them, the best option would be to find learning parties, but for lower end content you might struggle.

All in all i think the game is heading in the right direction, the combat is still far from none the best from mmos i've played in the past, but theyre working hard to help the more casual player out.

Now there are a few things i really dislike about LOA. Some of the raids are a little to punishing, having to make it through multiple phases without one person , making one wrong move , one mistake, zig when you should have zaged and its a wipe back to the beginning causes extreme gate keeping. Now lets get real the game is undoubtedly PTW. yah you could be free to play and do all content but the time investment would be insane. What i really dislike with this game is the way you acquire gear. having to craft gear instead of drops robs us of that excitement. Pheons smh are the absolute most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in a game. Lack of both genders when picking a class, i shouldn't be forced to play a female if i want to try a class. The over Serialization of female characters is just weird and the skins OMG one of my biggest grips with the game. i want to look bad ass when im slaying monsters not look like some enhanced bimbo in a bikini or lingerie with her jugs bouncing around.

The Need for Solo Legion Raids:

Smilegate RPG has undoubtedly crafted a masterpiece with Lost Ark, catering to both solo players and group enthusiasts alike. However, the absence of single-player legion raids for normal difficulties could be a missed opportunity. Implementing this feature would address the desires of players who prefer to experience content solo without compromising the existing group raid mechanics.

Adding single-player legion raids on normal difficulties would also benefit new players who may be hesitant to engage in group content early on. It would serve as a stepping stone, allowing them to hone their skills, learn raid mechanics, and gear up before venturing into more challenging group raids.

Furthermore, solo legion raids could offer an alternative way for players to experience the lore and unique encounters at their own pace, providing additional depth and engagement to the game's solo gameplay.",1691374205,55105.0,True,False,False,18,2,0.6170984506607055

And as a hardcore, returning player, I just really feel disappointing with the current game state.

The community is just toxic in general, you make one mistake, they tell you to die or just kick you out and 90% of current players avoid playing with newbies because the raid mechanic is punishing. It's fun if you know what you are doing and other ""7 people"" know what they are doing. Also 90% of current players will avoid lobby with newbie ""mokoko"" one.

There's reasons why LA went from above 1,300,000 players to just under $30,000 (including bots). Streamers talk about it a lots and the developers just meh, they don't really care lul. It's really sad, this game use to be great and fun but now it's dying.

For now, I just quit the game again, maybe I'll comeback to do some raid, maybe not.

1599340,False,"This game is great and does not require a lot of time investment if you only play one character. But if you _really_ want to push and experience the content with the community (what's left of it anyway) you will need to play more than one character, and diligently. Or you can whip out the credit card and swipe for gold, buy materials in the auction house. Prices these days have only gone UP because of the declining player base so real-money-to-in-game-currency exchange rate is extremely poor.

The gameplay and combat is S-tier. No other ARPG plays/feels like Lost Ark. Builds are not very varied and fairly simple to learn. Classes are regularly balanced, any class can reasonably clear content in the right hands. The combat is easy to learn but hard to master. It's what got me addicted and coming back even as I type this review out. Hell-mode raids (equalized content) are INSANELY fun, especially if you have a group of friends on voice-comms. As an ARPG player you will find yourself finding so many ways to min/max your playstyle and grow. And that's not even taking into account the vertical progression systems.

The main drawback of this game is really just the time required. Anyone, and I mean ANYONE, can probably learn and play the game well. But the start of all its problems is that the only end-game content is raids. Raids are your main source of gold. Gold is required to build out your character. Lots of it. And the systems that you funnel that gold into is all RNG based.

You hone pieces of gear (we call it ""tapping"" -- tap the hone button a few times, each time is a honing attempt). After a certain amount of taps (materials & gold) put in your gear is guaranteed to upgrade when this thing called an ""artisan's gauge"" hits 100%. There is a small chance that your gear will just successfully upgrade before hitting 100% (pity). Sounds good, right? Nope. The success chance at the end-game is usually < 3% success rate. And the amount of gold/materials that you need if you do not hit that 3% chance could be AN ENTIRE MONTHS WORTH of gold income and materials to hone your gear one or two levels across the board, assuming that you run raids on 4 to 6 characters (so a total of 12 to 18 raids PER WEEK). Why do you have to even interact with this hellish system? Because you item-level is determined by your gear. You MUST meet a specific item-level to enter raids. Otherwise you cannot even apply to parties.

So now assuming you got the item level and going back to the topic of raiding: all raids have wipe mechanics. If one person out of 8 messes things up, the ENTIRE PARTY dies. And those kinds of mechanics can happen MULTIPLE times in a SINGLE encounter. A single raid can have MULTIPLE encounters - we call these ""gates"". So one raid can have anywhere from 2 to 6 gates. Each character can earn gold from 3 RAIDS, MAX per week.

Because of the wipe mechanics, this game is new-player HOSTILE. Each gate can have multiple wipe mechanics so if you are playing with a set of people that are NOT ABSOLUTE experts a SINGLE GATE can take anywhere from 20 minutes to AN HOUR.

If you were to really try to optimize your playtime to earn gold, it's 3 raids per character. 6 characters max can earn gold per week. 18 raids per week total. Each raid has multiple gates. Each gate has wipe mechanics. The amount of time required to play skyrockets overtime and is very unstable as you go from party-to-party (unless you have a group of 7 other friends to play with that are consistent).

Now it's just a game, right? Why do this at all? For the gold. If you want to experience the game on a single character, not too bad if you just do dailies and whatnot for your weekly 5k gold stipend. But due to the RNG system pushing into the end-game content, that gold will get you two/three taps MAXIMUM on a SINGLE piece of gear. You will NEED to earn gold some other way, so other characters is your next avenue of income. 

So now, on top of gold, you also get roster/account experience from these raids and other horizontal content. But because raids are pretty much the only end-game activity, how high your roster level is will heavily depend on how many raids you run across your entire account. At least that's the logic that the community runs around with.

Why does that matter? Your roster level is visible when people inspect you. People inspect you when you apply for parties for raids. Now BECAUSE the raids are so unforgiving in terms of mechanics, most people will NOT accept players with low roster level. They have other raids to run and want things to go as smoothly as possible. Roster level is sub 100? Instant deny. There are stories of people with low roster level spending upwards of HOURS trying to find people to play with due to this kind of gate keeping.

On top of that, vertical progression materials are only available from CLEARING raids. How many materials you've earned from BEATING the raid is basically visible on your character when you apply to a party. So in most cases, this creates a catch-22 where you need to clear the raid to get gold and materials required to upgrade your character, but you cannot get into parties because you never cleared the raid in the first place for a variety of reasons. And all-in-all -- the game itself is economy driven, and the economy is heavily driven by gold. So there's this vicious feedback loop between the players and the economy, made worse by the various RNG systems that you HAVE to interact with to vertically progress. People equate time wasted in a raid with potential gold lost, therefore less buying power in the game itself for gearing their character or progressing their roster. So gatekeeping becomes complex for a myriad of reasons.

And overall because of the RNG systems for gearing (not just ""taps"" on your armor/weapon) the amount of in-game currency that you need to maintain that kind of progress increases exponentially. Another catch-22 where you want to play the game more, but can't because you have not played the game enough (i.e.: raids). There are usually in-game events that give you free currency and materials (everything but gold) but at most/best it'll help a single character to mid/late game. You will still need to interact with these systems multiple times as your find your in-game currency coffers lacking for where you want to go.

I genuinely love the combat in this game. Im over 4k hours into it and it's given me some amazing experiences. But I'm burnt out. These days even daily content is hard to find people to play/PUG with. The game actually feels like it's on its way out. One look at the steam charts and you'll see how the various vicious/predatory game systems/loops that I try to describe above are burning people out. We've literally lost 100k players in a matter of months. This really does feel like a job at the end of the day. I hope that the developers are able to address these complex problems somehow. But until they do I really cannot recommend this game unless you have actual real-life friends to play with (3 to 7 of them). And if you do, be wary of any burnout that you may experience.

1599340,False,"Let me save you a LOT of time. At one time I might recommend because of it being free BUT the game has too many barriers to be considered worth while.

Barrier 1 : the player base
Assuming you find people in your adventures (see Barrier 2), the majority of people you run into aren't helpful and are rather rude. An example of one such exchange was with a higher level/high gear score character that asked ""Do you do damage bro?"" From what I gather from similar interactions is that  they expect you'll understand and play your class correctly to whatever cookie cutter build they feel is superior.

Barrier 2 : the lack of player base
I can ignore other people well enough to enjoy most games. Unfortunately, when content is dependent on a certain number of people being present for it to even give you a small chance to get a collectible, you find yourself wasting HOURS going places just to find there isn't enough people to participate. This effectively prevents you from being able to complete certain collections or collect certain rewards. Extremely defeating if your wanting to casually collect Island Souls, Stars, whatever collectable you're working on because you'll never complete that collection or get that reward.

Barrier 3 : end game player base mentality
Now given the political environment in the US it is easy to feel like I've been thrown into some upside down where everything is opposite, morals what are morals?! Well in Lost Ark you don't actually do any endgame, you'll farm gold and pay others to do it for you. Yes prepare to numb your mind with dailies and weeklies as you amass your stash and then look for a group where you can pay someone 1k-10k (depending on the content) to do it for you. I'm 40 and hand holding isn't something I grew up with let alone look for in a game design. I want to learn fights, I want to discover what works. I have kids now but once upon a time I was banging my head in 20 man Zulgurub raids in WoW trying to be one of the first guilds on the server to clear it. That was years ago and apparently the on demand generations have just opted out of frustration and into complacent mind numbing daily tasks.

Barrier 4 : Currencies
Again I'm 40. UO, EQ, DAoC, and MUDs, this is what I played decades ago as a kid. All of them, or most, had one or two currencies that where used for everything. Not lost ark, you'll need currencies to buy currencies that will trade into items that you can use to get different currencies. Valuable metals, no that won't work. You'll need to collect crab testicles to trade for that item. Prepare to waste HOURS collecting those crab testies.

Now while I seem to be saying the players in Lost Ark suck, I am not. They are victims of poor game designs that push people into the paths of least resistance and result in zombie games like Lost Ark plodding along way after they've expired. It has potential and you'll find helpful players that are subject to the same abusive game designs you are and either have some inner issues of lack of self worth or just can't afford a better game.",1690823022,47109.0,True,False,False,4,0,0.5253817439079284

For one, I came in, I proved it for myself definitively, and I left May 2022.

Lost Ark is yet another Asia (mostly Korean bound honestly) MMO fantasy. All too familiar flavours and flairs, more than likely there is something for someone. Generic but not soulless, they did their take on the subject, is what I think the way to describe this. It reminded me much of a game from another time. A 2D arcade comic style fighter arpg, also from Korea, called Dungeon Fighter Online, or DNF. Nothing truly special, but a gameplay mix of fighting game and action-rpg. With Lost Ark, is the most engaging combo action gameplay compare to traditional arpg. Their take on a fighting arpg is refreshing, in a way a spiritual succession of it into top-down 3D.

It wasn't bad, until it was no good.

Free to play is such a likely hill. It would seems one can finally achieve full entry with no less can be offered. Instead, it is not.

Its possible that when you do log into the game you may feel a bit overwhelmed and inundated with all the User Interface prompts and further down the road you will find a really spread and deep system of tasks and quest-lines you can pursue.

The aesthetic components of this game, in combination with a wide and encompassing story allow for a really engaging and exciting experience. This game can be played solo and with friends.

1599340,False,"Had been a pre-launch player after spending a bit for the Silver Founder Pack, but otherwise played with only whatever was available in-game. Played pretty consistently ever since then before dropping the game outright a few weeks ago, so I'll just talk about what I think is most prominent when it comes to the good and bad here.

Early on, I would've heavily recommended this game to any starter or veteran MMO fans. Amazing in-combat gameplay that I feel tops the entirety of the isometric ARPG genre. All classes in the game, whether damage, support, or in-between focused, have amazing feel to them, with beautiful sound and serious weight behind all abilities and crazy visuals to boot. These get to take center stage in LA's consistently stunning combat encounters, via dungeons and raids. While it may seem a bit sluggish and lame to many, the story content of LA is also equally spectacular to watch, even if it can be campy or have lulls in between segments, but there are many story climaxes worth experiencing playing from the very beginning to the end. If this were all LA was, then I'd still be playing the thing, and the chance to continue experiencing that amazing gameplay was what kept me going. Until recently though, the grind burnout, plus news for the future of this game, finally put me off from wanting to play again.

That's where my final stance comes from, and why I don't recommend this to interested players going forward, especially brand new MMO players. This game burns you out bad, and regardless of people's stances on what the core game grind for powering up is, I just think it encourages bad play behavior to the game populace in general, especially to a Western audience on Global. So much of this game's core progression, leveling your characters, is locked between awful RNG mechanics. Though they've done a lot of streamlining for this since launch, the idea of having to roll against absolutely terrible odds (<5% or lower at late game) on several key gear options (6 armor pieces - with 2 RNG modes a piece) and having to play the game's skill building system ""engravings"", is just painfully demoralizing and what dropped off a lot of my own friends who used to play this with me. Unless you play a filled roster of characters farming materials daily, you will spend ages trying to meet the level requirements to play the game's star content. Even with the devs adding streamlining features (showering you with materials, ""express-passing"" select characters to skip low tiers), this hardly solves anything for newcomers to LA with the other dark side of the game, the community. In short, everything in Tier 1 and 2 is basically dead, and even the early-to-mid parts of Tier 3 are also dying out in player participation, which is shame since several amazing scenarios and encounters are in those level zones (Phantom Palace and Alaric abyssal dungeons to name a few). People trying to learn and attempt anything beyond those stages will be stuck looking for fellow newer players, or patient others, to actually participate in the later game ""Legion Raids"" which basically take the forefront of most players attention. Teachers are far and few for this showy but difficult content, and anyone not teaching or new will not bother accepting other players looking for first-time or low experience players.

All-in-all, unless you intend to play LA for the side collection gameplay (which is pretty fun) with no raiding or lategame in mind, you're going to dislike coming to this brand new. And even people looking to focus on those collections will find it hard to do even alone since several aspects of it require others to play with you. And just like Tier 1/2 content, those social areas are also dead or dying too, so no full completions for you. Save your time and sanity, play something else if you're new.

If you're not new and thinking about returning to LA, don't. Even the latest Korean news with LA shows almost none of the core issues are expected to be adjusted, with only more of the same coming down the pipe for Koreans and us alike. No amount of new class, raid or summer event announcements could interest me to come back as long as this game's current environment will continue to persist.

----June 2024 Update----

Half curiosity and half addiction, I decided to reboot the game again after playing several other iso-ARPGs for some time and missing the insane combat and gameplay LArk had to offer before. At the short of everything, I'll simply say, the combat and raiding were as showy and awesome to play and watch as it's always been, so good news there.

The rest of it is simply bad news to me and I once again cannot endorse anyone, new or returning, to play LA moving forward, as, like I said before, the future outlook isn't any better by this point. Several new classes and raids have come into the mix over the past year since I bailed, and, while the new classes are fun and interesting, all this potential gameplay is STILL stonewalled hard by the stupidly restrictive progression system in LArk.

Primary gear progression, via gear honing, is still absolutely trash at the 1500+ iLVL point, and hell, even 1500 iLVL isn't even good enough to most public groups these days. Hell, old school hard mode content for the first Legion Raid, Valtan, is STILL gated by players playing well above the raid's level requirement, demanding massive overleveling, established card sets, high level gems, and much more. Unless you run a character through an Express pass with support for all those upgrades, you are going to be HARD pressed to find anyone to play, at least in anything PUG. Shoot, I haven't even touched upon the additional layers of gear leveling/upgrading beyond all this nonsense, which, to no surprise, is even more layers of insanely low RNG rates that will just frustrate you to no end.

1599340,False,"They killed the PVP scene in this game. In what is one of the most fun and unique combat systems, they gave the pvp community absolutely no amenities and refused to change their horrible matchmaking system.

Some examples of issues that have been present since launch:
-Slow fall bug. If you take enough damage while knocked up, your character will fall slowly to the ground. This extends the amount of time you are CC'd and often leads to a significantly larger loss of health.

-Matchmaking. Instead of normal modern matchmaking variants, they took the worse of both worlds between Skill-based matchmaking and Non-SBMM. All players in the region have their queue pop at the same time, THEN the system decides who will actually be going into games. Before the PVP scene completely died, I've had times where I was getting kicked out of queue for more than an hour at a time. 

-Balance. It's cliche to complain about balancing, but the issue is exceptionally bad here. Scouter, scrapper, soulfist, and now most support classes like bard and paladin are FAR too weak compared to the extremely strong classes such as gunslinger, deathblade, or summoner. In the upcoming balance patches from South Korea, their nerf to summoner in PVP nerfs her trait, but her imbalance comes from the fast, reliable, nuke damage she gets on top of low start-up hard CC's.

-Ranked MMR and Seasons. Ranked seasons last 6 months. That is way too long considering how small the PVP community was when the game launched in North America. Additionally, there were absolutely 0 ranked resets from launch to now. This issue is so bad that there are players in Grand Master (Highest possible rank) that will have as low as 5 games won for the season and only play once every two weeks to avoid rank decay; Which makes ranking in higher elo near impossible as the vast majority of GM is gatekept by inactive players.",1688773803,31408.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.5162523984909057
1599340,False,"Lost Ark Community Managers put out a July Player Survey and I started writing about why I'm not playing the game hardly since the June Patch for some poor soul at Amazon to probably never read, and figured I'd also put that at the bottom while I'm at it.

As for new people wanting to try this game: 

New players will never have the early game experience I had to push me to play as much as I did. You will skip past T1-2 and half the raids/dungeons the game has to offer that I got to learn on par with a group. Once you skip to T3 and current content you will be gatekept by the ones who want to get the raids done as quickly as possible and move on to their next character for the week.

Learning parties are far and few between, so you can try to sneak into an experienced run. But if you started now or recently, you will have to swipe to reach the newest endgame content quickly, and you'll still be missing the rng obtained card sets you need and stick out like a sore thumb because of your roster level that experienced lobbies check. There ARE lobbies that will take you anyways but expect to spend some time getting denied first. The PvP scene is pretty much nonexistent and the open world bits are unbalanced, so look elsewhere if that's what you're wanting out of this game. 

""But you have over 2k hours"" a lot of that was spent playing the game in a different state than what it currently is, with new raids and content every other month, and building new characters to that new content was relatively cheap and not as time consuming. We are almost caught up to Korea and that pacing of content release is going to slow way down while honing costs and time spent for less gain will continue to go up. 

The combat is very fun and visually the game looks great. Fleshing out your character's build and seeing it come together is very satisfying, but tripods, engravings, and skill points are one and done pretty early on.
Ultimately, your character's growth will become governed solely by honing your item level and nothing else, which doesn't give that same satisfaction as it's exponentially more time consuming and expensive for less and less gain.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Spending about 250k gold to push my main from 1565 to 1580 after months of doing the same dailies was honestly just too disheartening. The people I play with either run 18 raids a week for gold and have a main 6 roster almost or all 1580+ OR they don't play enough and aren't able to run the new 1580 content on their main. They likely won't be there in time for Akkan either.
I work Mon-Fri, and for months, I dedicated more than half of each day off, including Friday after work to run rested chaos and rested guardians on my roster, and try to squeeze in raids during the week or after grinding dailies during the weekend. 
And to do that just to barely scrape by to reach 1580 knowing I will only be able to continue playing new content if I continue to grind even more was a realization that finally hit after spending months of materials and gold on that honing session. I enjoy the game's raids when I can, but not 6 characters a week. 
For a long while, I ran 10+ characters of chaos and guardians, and established a strong main 6 roster. Then I started to cut back and only run main 6 chaos and guardians that generated the new materials, then with new content only my 4 characters at 1540+ I would run rested daily content on. 
Despite that, I wouldn't have even had enough gold to push ONLY my main to 1580 if not for playing the fish market and holding onto that gold for months. That itself required brainless hours buying Redflesh fish and Pearls because of the Auction House changes to combat bots. That well is now dry, and I don't have it in me to build it back up, either by doing the same chaos and guardian spam every Fri-Sun or sitting there slowly buying up a small ocean of fish watching something on the side.

I will and I won't miss this game. The experience at launch and for a while after was some of the best this game had to offer. Me and all my friends learning new mechanics through tier 1 and 2 dungeons and raids, watching each other hone up, and doing content together. Who can make it to T3 first and start selling those great honor leapstones for 800 gold a pop? The 1340-1370 dead zone was the first time the brakes hit the train, some of us made new alts, some took the time to play something else after no lifing the game since release. Argos comes out and we all prog gate 1 together but then numbers started dropping from our group because of the grind. The rest of us continue on, running Argos 1-3 for weeks till Valtan. Slowly through Vykas, Clown, and Brel NM, some started playing less and for others this game became a second (or first for the students/unemployed) job. 

I grew my roster during this, through more characters to run chaos, occasional swiping, and changing from gunslinger to reaper main I had several strong characters that could run the newest content or at least the first few gates of it. The honing past 1540 is where I finally started to feel the pain of honing draining my resources. My reaper was 1520 on Brel NM release, some other alts were 1500 or working up to it. Same for Brel HM release. My reaper was 1560 and fewer alts were 1540 ready for at least gates 1-2. And yet, I never cleared or even got to attempt gates 5-6 HM because for those who this game became a second job attempted it (and they've still yet to even clear it) without me and the ones I really wanted to try it with. So the ones left behind just stopped playing pretty much because they don't wanna pug it, and understandably so. I usually ran Brel HM 1-2 on 4 characters and 3-4 on 2 of those 4. Now Kayangel is here and my only character I used up the last of my resources to reach 1580. The rest of my roster will never reach that, and realizing so I don't wanna put in the time to even try.

If you have friends or want to experience the early raids - the free powerpass you get to make your character is definitely worth it... the only issue is finding learning parties, ive enjoyed running a lot of learning parties but its rare to see anyone trying to help.

1599340,False,"I had a ton of fun with this game in the first year of release and progress up through 1540 was relatively fine, but after that is when things start to significantly slow down. I was able to get my main to 1580 and my gold earning alts to 1540 without spending money but at the cost of grinding for 3-6 hours a day. The game expects players to run chaos dungeons, guardian raids, unas, cube, raids on multiple characters on a daily to weekly basis and the amount of time that it takes to do these chores is quite significant. I was getting burned out keeping up with multiple characters and cut back to only playing one or two. 

This week on the developer's Korean roadmap, there was a lot of expectations about addressing the amount of ""homework"" that people need to do each week since it's getting to be a bit too much. The daily tasks, even when done every other day, take up several hours of time. While the raids are very challenging and fun at the start, it quickly becomes very annoying to have one player wipes the raid mechanics when you're doing things 6x a week just to earn gold. However, the developers stated that they will not be reducing the amount of chaos dungeons or guardian raids that can be done daily, although they plan to make them a bit faster. They're choosing not to nerf any of the older farm content raids, and are in fact nerfing the gold earned from ""outdated"" content which is Brelshaza and earlier. They have basically ignored what players from all regions have been saying for a year. 

The honing rates and gold costs on Akkan and onward are far worse than what we currently have getting to 1580 and it can take weeks of farming just to land an upgrade or two without spending. The upcoming elixir system is going to cost 500k-2mil gold per character depending how much you want to upgrade it.

1599340,False,"It's been more than a year since I've quit the game. Recently I've been contemplating about if I should come back, but after seeing what they have in store for the following year I decided not to. To properly min max your material generation is about 5 hours a day of daily content. Raids are three times a character (up to 6 will generate gold) once a week but take a varying amount of time to complete thanks to the fact that there are multiple pass or fail mechanics no matter how much you over gear the content. This leads to incredible amounts of cherry picking in party finder. You would not have an issue if you're like me who has spent thousands of USD to help gear all my characters, but for the vast majority of people you will probably spend more time in party finder + disbanding after wipes than actually raiding efficiently. These issues were very briefly touched upon every single announcement, but it's been years with no change so at this point it's a hard no to reduction in chores.

Localization from AGS is terrible. Many texts are mistranslated and your typical twitter politics happen to characters as well. They randomly change skin colors of random NPC's and even changed the skin color of when you transform into your demonic form for a class called Shadowhunter. They add extra clothing to random NPC's and the ""short people"" race. There's not much censorship to skins/classes or skin swaps thankfully, but it happens very sporadically. It's as if they have no real cohesion or firm decision making in that studio, and even then they're doing a terrible job just doing their primary function which is just translating.

The only good thing about this ""mmo"" (this is barely an mmo, its an ARPG) is the fluid comabt system, but good luck trying to get into content when you're being gatekept by gear that take you months up to two years to obtain.

I couldn't possibly put into words how poorly new players get treated. It's just not worth the headache of hundreds of hours to get to that point, just for you to see how bad it is.

I'm done with it personally. Maybe one day things will change drastically, but until the playerbase completely bottoms out and folks stop spending money on gacha systems and slot machine rolls that exist in this game, that isn't happening.

Gate keeping is real and depending on how high your gear level is or in fact, what class you're playing, you might have to literally waste precious time and hope someone takes you.
Surely you could make your own party, just don't expect decently geared players will show up in the next at least 5 minutes or much more than that.
Dailies/Weeklies can get super tedious but since it's a MMORPG I wouldn't say that's really the main reason to quit the game imo.

No, I would not recommend this to anyone new, unless you manage to find some people to literally take care of you until you're geared.

1599340,False,"I'll put this here just to filter my thoughts out. 
I do play (still unfortunately) since the initial release of the game.
Apologies upfront for any grammar and spelling mistakes I make in this text.

CONS:
1. This game is NOT casual/F2P friendly in any way possible even though it might act like it. 
- Yes, even though game does provide you with ""a lot"" of free stuff to progress your character/s faster, the overwhelming grind you have to do to actually achieve a ""proper"" endgame expirience overshadows all of it.
- If you hear that this game feels like ""having a new job"" sort of way, it is indeed true.
- For each one of these ""problems"" or lets say non casual friendly ""mechanics"" I am going to list here, I could make a separate paragraph how it corrupts the whole gameplay expirience:
Gatekeeping, FOMO, Absurd amount of toxicity especially in raids, RNG on casino level,... this is pretty much constant daily expirience for even most of veteran players till this date... 

2. Game design is corrupted to the core with INSANE amount of RNG systems to progress your character. 
- Do not get me wrong here... I like a lot of systems which provide you way to progress... however in this game, every single one is pretty much full fledged casino expirience... it is RNG fiesta at this point.
- The only thing that has a so called ""pity meter"" where you are pretty much ""guaranteed"" a successful character progression in some period of a time is honing (enchanting your main set of gear).
- Every other character progression system is a predatory RNG system designed for you to spend some cash or spend that ""new job"" amount of time to be successful and achieve what you aim for. (Yes, MMOs are supposed to be grindy... that is completely fine and that is also part of why I like this genre... this game however takes this topic to a whole different lvl worth of paragraph itslef.)

3. Things I have already mentioned before such as: Gatekeeping, FOMO, Toxicity, RNG, are not an uncommon occurrence even in MMO genre. However, what I do have to say is that even after thousands of hours spent in different MMOs (and other generes), I had never expirienced these issues to have such a hard impact on the playerbase itself, the game is literaly repulsive to play after a while with all of that negative expirience.

PROS:
1. Great combat!
- The combat this game has is quite an expirience. Every single class does feel unique and well designed it its own way. Combat wise this game is pleasure to play.

2. Immerse endgame PVE expirience. 
- The whole part of raids, ""legion raids"", that this game offers at endgame is arguably one of the best in whole MMO genre.
- You have to learn certain mechanics to be successful, but its worth it. From cinematic point of view to music... that part is worth of some time to expirience it .

3. Somewhat decent graphics. The asymetric camera point of view is also quite well designed.

Summary:
With all things considered, I just can't and will not recommend this game to any new, casual or F2P player.
In my opinion, the game is great in its own ways with tremendous potential to grow and fix certain issues that players do provide as a feedback. However I do not see that hapenning in any near future or at all to be honest, since many changes that ""community"" feels like they should be implemented just do colide with that predatory game design they have.
The scale of changes that would have to happen in game to be fun for new players and also keep veteran players invested for longer seems to be too great to actually happen.
It would probably just lose AGS and Smilegates a lot of money generation they got implemented in the game systems and well... nobody likes losing money right?


Edit:
There were some positive changes made in the game, and some more are still on the way. These changes do provide for new players as veterans.

1599340,False,"How should I put this.... I both love and hate this game
after 4500 hours into the game, spent at least couple thousand dollars, I feel I know enough. I quit the game few months ago mostly due to the amount of time you need. 
They say most games are either pay-to-win or extremely time consuming to keep up with the rest of the community, this game actually requires both...

Pros-
-graphic is decent, characters are very pretty
-game play is nice, requires you to actually know what you are doing with your class/skills etc
-upgrading gear has a pity system so at least you know there is a ""end"" (even if it costly you tons of gold/material regardless)
-community --this is variable since i started the game since it came out, if you are new, likely it is difficult to keep up and you will likely get yelled at alot

Cons- (two major ones)
-EXTREMELY time consuming, let me tell you why: if you want to just focus on one character (like many other MMORPGS), this game is NOT for you. By having alts, they can contribute to income for resources/gold/material for you to hone. Each character have their own individual daily chaos dungeons/bosses, weekly raids/quests. Looking back, I spent somewhere between 6-8 hours a day playing this just to get daily/weeklies done on 6 characters, that is usually not maintainable for most people with a regular worklife
-RNG system / cost: just spending time doesn't really get you the stuff you need. game has alot of in-game purchases for cosmatics/packs that you kinda need to get cards/honing mats. The game does give out free stuff frequently, but if you want to do the raids as soon as they come out, those will not be nearly enough. So that means if you REALLY want to keep up, more often than not you will need to pay real money for in-game stuff, especially if you are not playing 6-8h+ per day on 6+ alts. 
-some of the raids are really unforgiving, this could be frustrating for alot of people since there is always that ONE person out of eight people that screws up that ONE mechanism and wipe the raid the 50th times at 3AM in the morning.... But this goes back to ""you really need to know what you are doing"", so it depends on who is reading this. 


Overall, I love the game, but for a REGULAR person, unless you are really casual and just want to do a daily quest/boss kill for fun here and there and don't really care much about anything else, then this game is NOT for you. You really need to be semi-hardcore PLUS willing to spend cash to stay on the front line when raids come out etc.

You earn gold through selling your tradeable dropped materials in daily content, but the bulk of your gold earning is through running your gold-earning raids on 6 different characters.

1599340,True,"Fun game! 

I definitely recommend it but there are some very obvious negatives in this game that should be pointed out.

Negatives:

1. Pheons
2. Pay 4 convenience at end game
3. The ability stone crafting ""mini game"" is and can be influenced by you, but to craft a good end game stone it is all based on percentage luck. You either get it or you don't, this requires you to spam buying them on the market with pheons which are heavily expensive in the cash shop but also you get very little from actual in game activities.
4. Population (ill explain below) & end game raid gate keeping

These are negatives I would see mostly in end game, these 4 points above have almost no impact to anybody starting the game or even somebody doing guardian boss raids for progression.

About population: I am speaking for NA server mostly. If you are on EU this may be different and their may be more population there, you'll have to read other reviews to see.

Engravings heavily dictate whether you get into a pub group or not. This is also heavily determined by the fact that not many people actually do Legion raids in pubs. If you don't have the expensive engravings for your class and general damage engravings and proper stat diversity for your class, which of course is the goal of most people in end game then you will be denied.

This gate keeping is a problem mainly because the only way to efficiently get gold in this game is to do those very raids. 

The only way to get engravings CONSISTENTLY is to get gold and buy them from the market, which again requires gold, which forces people to RMT gold or exchange yellow crystals for gold and spam buy them off the market.

Your best bet for end game progression if you don't run a static is to get into learning groups, which end up taking a bunch of time because you won't have the engravings and stats and you'll be playing with people who don't know the raid, even if you do know the raid and are building gold for your gear/engravings. 3-4 hours for Vykas runs that may never actually succeed past gate 2.

I heavily suggest this company look at making an incredible diversity of engravings, to encourage more unique play styles while offering the same damage output for those play styles. This would make engravings cheaper across the board and allow a choice of play style while still doing good damage and be accepted into parties. 

I'll be honest even since Russia/Korea launch, it's been Grudge as a meta damage engraving. It still is. Let that sink in.

So that is one major problem in the end game, and it's mostly due to lack of engraving diversity (which makes the meta engravings extremely expensive for both general and class engravings for meta class builds) but also with a low population it makes gate keeping from actually getting gear progression + gold very difficult unless you run in statics. To get into a static though is difficult, most statics are just that, static, so they have little to no adjustment and stick with their core group and knock out their dailies/weeklies extremely quickly for their progression.
 
Positives:

Everything else, the combat is some of the best combat I've seen in an iso ARPG. They are starting to introduce male and female variants for classes which is great and they're doing good work just recently in balancing out the classes equally.

Classes are well constructed, they have their own elements and feel and they provide a good experience regardless of what you play IMO. They all feel good when playing, so it'll come down to what you prefer the most.

You'll have slots to assign your ""gold generation"" characters to, these would be considered your mains, because in this game you don't truly have ""one"" main. You have like 5-6 mains where you assign gold to and you build those characters up by doing raids, because you can get rewards for each of those characters even in Legion raids. So you end up in long term end game generating gold with many mains not just one. I like this approach as you don't get too bored easily with one class and always being on it, you can switch it up (in this case you're forced to if you want more gold/materials).

Also with alts you can do Chaos, which will give you enhancement materials and they are trade-able, so you can sell them or put them in your family storage and use them for your gold generation characters. 

End game raids are rewarding and the Legion raids exceptionally challenging, this is a pro and con for a lot of people. Brelshaza can be considered too long of a raid and possibly split up into 2 parts, giving decent rewards for each ""part"". The difficulty of these raids in hell mode are ridiculously tough, and not as rewarding but I think most people play them just so they can have the challenge as a group which is great.

I do feel though that normal mode Brel, Kakul and Vykas could be toned down a bit or even introduce an easy mode with less rewards of course.

They have a training grounds to test skills and mechanics, it's amazingly done.

They introducing patches recently that favor improving currently bad performing specs. For example, Gunslinger has been the much better class over deadeye in both PvE and PvP for a while, they just released patch notes that significantly improve Deadeye's gameplay potential.

Suggestions for game devs if you're watching:

1. They used to have a rogueiite-esque dungeon that they took away, it was actually fun, I forget the name of it because I played it in Russia only but they should really bring that back as a side game. It used to be the way you'd get your bracelet I believe, but they changed this. It used to have levels, and you'd build up your characters stats and abilities to the point where you'd be mowing down enemies, you could get up to extremely high levels. This zone was cool. They should bring it back.
2. Lower pheon cost and add more from in game activities or remove it all together. It's predatory imo since it is heavily tied to farming ability stones for end game.
3. Lower Chaos run amounts but improve material gain for it. This would free up alt time usage and allow meaningful progression elsewhere.
4. Easy mode Legion raids or lower normal difficulty raids for better entry progression in end game.
5. Better engraving diversity ... 90% of the engravings are useless.

PvP Suggestions:

1. Lower immunity hit count down by 1 to introduce immunity earlier, to prevent horrible cc spam (people who know PvP know what I mean, the cc overlap can allow a massive amount of cc layering on people)
2. If you DC you should be able to come back, if you DC for longer than 1 minute or 1 1/2 minute, you should be penalized but they shouldn't lose rank (for ranked only of course). Time could be adjusted here of course, but you get my point. We should be able to join back if we get dc'd or our game crashes. How this isn't in the game is mind boggling. This should be for PvE as well, ability to re-enter the zone.
3. 1 minute of adjustments prior to game match starting, there have been countless times where you'll get 2 supports on your matchup and it's usually an auto loss if they have dmg + 1 support unless they are extremely new to PvP. Which shouldn't be the case. 

When you queue for PvP, you should be put into that queue like it does, but when it pops, there should be a window similar to when you do Legion raids with a 1 minute timer that can allow you to see the classes that will be on the teams and make adjustments. Yes, this introduces heavy counterplay potential, but this also allows you the ability to switch up your class if you get double supports or a mixture of players where the comp would be an auto loss. The benefits far outweigh the negatives here. After that 1 minute is up, the class you end up being on is the one that will get queued. This gives an equal playing ground to choose what you want before entering a PvP arena match. You can do this in custom games, it should be the same in unranked/ranked queues.",1685283381,32838.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1599340,False,"This game has extremely fun content that I love playing, but this review will focus on the negative side of the game.

There are so many barriers to get to the fun content that new players will have an awful time getting there. The game has an account level system that is an accumulation of the experience from all of your characters combined. People will not accept you into groups if that level is not high enough. The developers are adding catch up mechanics and systems but they do not have any way to help players catch up with experience and an outdated card system in the game that takes months/years to complete due to random chance packs and is becoming a standard requirement in the late game making it hard on new players.

Don't let the single player tag fool you into thinking you can play this game completely solo because you will need to play with other players due to Legion Raids being a requirement to upgrade your gear to experience higher level content. There is plenty of solo content in the game, but that is not the most satisfying and well designed content the game has to offer.

There are outdated monetization systems in the game that people have vocalized their discontent about and the developers refuse to remove them. It is one of the main reasons why the majority of players quit the game and it's not something you will be able to avoid.

Even though the game has great content, I do not recommend this game to new players because of the amount of gate keeping new players experience from the community, and the reason the gate keeping exists is because of the amount of playtime that is required on all of your characters to earn gold and build up that account experience. If you only play one character, you won't have the account level that is acceptable when looking for a party.

- This game want really hard to be your 2nd job but here is a plot twist: you will need to pay them ... .
- Game system are punishing Old players for playing with New players that create one of the most toxic and gatekeeping community that i have ever saw in video game (and i have played League for a while...).
- If you want to play other class build then meta you will get punished by the game and other players.
- Published by AGS that don't care about player.
- Good luck with geting help if something happend (automated AGS support just dont care).
- Amazon's Censorship.

PROS:
- Cool graphic and animations.
- Lot of content to do.
- No that bad story as for ARPG.

1599340,True,"I find Lost Ark to be the sort of game that I play for a period of time and really enjoy before gradually getting bored of the grind and gatekeeping and take a break again. I tend to come back for events that look like fun or when a new class is released and at this point I am fine with that as I can't really see myself getting that invested into it. 

In my experience the community hasn't been great so this hasn't really pushed me towards wanting to raid in any serious way so there isn't much of a goal to keep grinding towards. I don't think this is necessarily just the community being at fault though, the game very much encourages it. I almost got the sense that it was just a lot of people who were angry all the time, they had invested a lot of time, effort and probably money into the game and it causes a lot of frustration in endgame, especially if you can't find a bunch of people who have been just as dedicated as you.

I enjoyed most of the story, some of it was quite drawn out especially at the start but as you get more into it I think it does become more enjoyable. It is a great looking game too, so I have spent plenty of time just exploring around different islands, doing events, getting island souls etc. 

It's a difficult one, on the one hand I don't recommend it if you are looking for something to get really invested into as I don't think the gatekeeping, the community frustration and the bot infestations have helped. On the other hand if you just want to play a game that looks nice, has some cheesy cosmetics in it and you can have some fun just smashing everything to pieces with some flashy spells and abilities, as you sail around a bunch of islands doing all sorts of wacky quests and events, then sure I recommend it...

And here are few issues I had with game:
- Even there were partial or whole story story skips for 1-2 characters, It was really hard for me to level new character thru completly boring, uninteresting, non challenging and single player story every time.
- Speaking about that, even game is multiplayer(mmorpg) many parts feels like singleplayer. Yes there are people here and there, but apart from Weekly Raids it feels very singleplayer-ish. Like all activities are either solo or very easy.
- Honing is uninteresting gear upgrade machanic. I do not mind honing failures, but I preffer loot to drop or be obtained via craft and I didnt really like the idea, that after daily activities on character, only option to upgrade gear is press button 1-3 times to see if something success or fail.
- After while game feels like chore,  like daily/weekly checklist for every character. There is daily reset for in game activities and I was forcing myself to do them on every char and it was very time consuming every day.",1684362784,36619.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5036764740943908
1599340,False,"After over 2,000 hours and before Hard Mode Brelshaza was released I quit the game. I had some amazing experiences in the game and I will not forget it. Defeating the available Legion commanders for the first time was satisfying, the combat is responsive, and going through the story quests was a unique experience. Oh man, going through that one siege story quest was amazing for the first time and seeing Nia's drawing was so funny. 

I quit the game because of the gatekeeping, honing, the amount of times you needed to run chaos dungeons, you can only run legion raids once on a single character, the inability to freely send gear to your other characters, and incentive for multiple characters. Like most MMOs, this game requires a huge time commitment. 

At first, I did not mind the honing until reaching past item level 1400. It started to not make sense to me, all this grinding, all the materials I gathered are just going to be use for a chance, A CHANCE, to upgrade gear. I get it, they want to nudge players to pay to hone so the company can make money.

The inability to practice mechanics in Legion Raids made it punishing for new players and learning raids typically disband after 1-3 tries or never complete the raids. The mechanics are not forgiving at all, unless your item level is more than the required item level. Even in experience groups, if someone makes a mistake 1 party or the entire raid group needs to restart or it makes the rest of the raid even more challenging. This can cause so much anxiety for players and they will never complete the raid.

I remember being told I don't need to make multiple characters. It is true, however the game rewards players who play multiple characters daily and the reward is so much to pass. You get more materials for which you can sell or not or transfer to other characters. I think if you do not do dailies/weeklies on multiple characters, you significantly fall behind.

besides all that for me the worst part is that I love the combat but I cant just ""combat"". There is no fun content to do, the stuff thats there is mandatory and feels forced and makes it unfun. The collectibles require mostly no combat, while the raids require a PHD and 30 minutes of YouTube to understand the mechanic, which are still not fun cause if 1 person fucks up it wipes everyone.

There is nothing in between its either so easy you can play with ur eyes closed or so arbitrary hard that I have to keep track of a million things or else wipe. (which is not ""hard"" btw, its just annoying, has nothing to do with skill, its just follow the instruction or wipe, but there are 120 instructions""

Or a complete bust for others.

The overall gameplay is great with the ""fixed view"" (like Diablo and Wolcen etc)
The combat system is great. Lots to choose from and many ways to build your char.
Classes has two stages, Class and Advanced - kinda like sub-classes. Warrior has for example the subclasses Berseker and Paladin, And the Mage class has Sorceress and Summoner. A total of 23 different Advanced Classes are available atm, and more will come.

Character Customization is the middle part, there are options but limited as classes are gender locked.
Atleast to some degree, ex. Martial Artist has both Male and Female classes. 

If you like co-op and teamwork, then this is great for you as they have raids that require 8 players to complete, and these raids must be done to be able to get on with the main story.
(peronally thats a bad thing for me as I prefer Solo play, you can solo most of the game but you hit a brick wall when it comes to gettin gear at higher lvls)
Zones are ""locked"" behind item lvl, thus you are required to do those raids to get those higher lvls to even do main story.

Either you love or hate it... Those raids are mostly ""controlled"" by the best geared players as they sell boosts (bussing) in said raids... Kinda ruin it for me... Even though I love the game in general!

It's a shame that you never get to really see your character (or any one else's) because of the top-down isometric view point of the game.  You can mostly see the top of their head and they are small and feel far away.  I don't feel very immersed when i can't even see the combat animations properly.

The Korean VO pack was a nice DLC for free.  The English VO sounded very stilted and unnatural.  Still, that's only a minor flaw to me.  I could even tolerate the point and click movement style, even though it's not what i'd prefer.

The art style and concept of the game reminds me a lot of Black Desert or Blade and Soul, in the way that you destroy masses of enemies at once which can be fun and satisfying.

1599340,False,"I know you could look at the play time and be like, how the hell is it a 'no', well, here's why:

Lost Ark is an AMAZING game. Fun as hell to play through and makes you feel like an absolute god when you get into the rhythm and MVP a legion raid or hit an upgrade on your last item that will unlock new content.

BUT. I've come to realise that getting there just isn't worth it any more. The first few times, getting the 'big' upgrade felt great, now, Its just a dreadful realisation that you'll have to do it again and again. The joy of success is replaced by the relief of not failing. 

The Raids are amazing when you have an organised group and you're figuring it all out for the first time, finding that flow where you go from just pulling through to absolutely smashing the encounter but you start to see they're just a constant mess of '1 guy fails, you all die' mechanics when you're trying to get alts through with pugs. 

The progression loop is 100% linear, you want to try a new class but you realise its going to be MONTHS of pushing it through the same old shit you've done 100 times already just to get it to the point where it feels 'good' compared to your main. Imagine WoW TBC classic, if you're familiar, but now imagine that the linear progress is walled off by a material grind you cannot skip thats tied to each raid tier and is time gated, you cant do Kara once and move on, you MUST do it for 2 to 3 weeks THEN the next tier for 4 to 5 weeks and then *IF* your slot machine upgrade system rolled all 7's you can go to the 'current' tier. 

The games just become a job. One that hands out promotions at random.

Plus, you don't have to pay for it.

If you have a passion or you are looking for an MMO, you want to return to an earlier abandoned project or start on a fresh jump-server already having experience in the game, then you should think about not downloading this game at all.
Despite all the mechanics and events that allow you to quickly grow in the game, the number of rewards in the mail and in all sorts of menus will inject dopamine into your brain - this is an illusion. This particular version of the game has huge problems with character progression between certain power levels, not to mention the fact that the very structure of the game involves grinding on 6 characters at once, if not more. Having one main here is simply not comfortable, especially considering that the game is f2p and essentially p2w+gacha within PvE. Obviously, the restrictions are designed to suck money out of the player in the stages approaching the endgame. The game has a ton of content, but not all of it is accessible and is tied to the character's ""strength"". Moreover, due to this design and philosophy of the game, in which it is practically impossible to take a break and you had to start from the start of the server (without huge investments, of course), another problem arises. All active online is concentrated at the very top (highend-game) of the content, while everything that is below is no longer relevant for them...however, for newly arrived players, about 60% of the content involves matchmaking, and 20-30% is vital for developing an account and getting actual meaningful in-game currency. As a result, there comes a time when this GOLD cannot be obtained in the game, except by buying it from Amazon or (more realistically) on some web-site, thereby creating a demand for “RMT” and bots in the game. To be honest, it feels like there are still more bots in the game than live players. Amazon or Smilegate jucked up core version of the game to point where you ain't able to make gold in any way no matter if you have dedicated alts (usually 5 for weekly on easy mode with 1380 power lvl which are EZ), yeap you slowly progress through content on main...kinda, then you wait eternity. There is no way of making money in game besides very endgame where all old players are, I hope there is people out there. There is no new players and mid-ones, and there is content for groups in that middle that designed to give you gold...just don't exist no more.
In any case, draw your own conclusions whether you should play this or not and why.

1599340,False,"The game has received a lot of hype and anticipation, but unfortunately, it falls short of expectations in many ways. While the game is visually stunning with its detailed graphics and intricate character designs, the gameplay itself is lacking.

One of the biggest issues, is the repetitive nature of the game. Players will find themselves completing the same tasks and missions over and over again, with little variation or innovation. This makes the game feel tedious and monotonous, quickly draining any excitement or enthusiasm players may have had.

Another problem with Lost Ark is the lack of meaningful player choice. The game is incredibly linear, with little room for player agency or decision-making. This leaves players feeling like they are simply going through the motions, without any real impact on the world around them.

Furthermore, the game's progression system is overly complicated and confusing. Players are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information and options, making it difficult to understand what they should be doing or how to improve their characters.

Finally, the game's microtransaction system is predatory and exploitative. It is clear that the game is designed to push players towards spending real money in order to progress or have a better experience. This is a major turn-off for many players and leaves a sour taste in their mouths.

Overall, Lost Ark may look like an impressive and exciting game, but it ultimately fails to live up to expectations due to its repetitive gameplay, lack of meaningful player choice, confusing progression system, and predatory microtransaction model.",1683316461,126714.0,True,False,False,8,1,0.5408437848091125

1599340,False,"Quite possibly one of the worst MMOs to play nowadays unless you have time to spend every single day. It is plagued by the Korean gamer mentality of dailies for progression that have been a plague since gacha games started becoming a thing in the last 10 or so years. All your progression is gated behind dailies, and around making multiple characters to do more dailies. Defenders of this practice will point out the rest gauge, completely forgoing that you don't get full rewards with rest gauge. The game just constantly kicks this problem down the road and refuses to change it do to their sycophant fans in the Korean game that love this game design to gatekeep new or returning players or players that can't spend every day to login. The game would be exceedingly better if they did away with the dailies progression and went to more traditional grinding and time investment progression.

But they won't do that because having dailies and progression gating encourages you to buy honing (progression) materials from the shop or auction house for real money! Which is the entire goal behind this.

1599340,False,"You probably wonder why I put a negative review on this game, while I have almost 3 000 hours on. On this day I absolutely do not recommend Lost ark to anyone. Whatever you are a casual or hardcore player, a good or a bad mmo player, the game is just an endless grindfest. When you think you are ahead of most player, AGS and smilegate publish a new update, and the grind continue. You have to keep going every week with your multiple characters or you will be behind. ""It is not too bad"" you will say, except that if you are too much behind, you cannot do raids anymore, even the ones that are from 1 year ago. 

The community of this game is atrocious. They will rage and insult at annyone that is not doing what they want you to do, even if you think it is completly fine. The gatekeep and the carry ""bus"" on this game are real, it is probably the Mmo where those things are the most popular, witch is not a good thing at all, for new players, existing ones and the economy in general. In a mmo, an environnement where ""big players"" are fed by ""new players"" cannot exist, or the game will simply die.
Talking about economy. Ags and smilegate tried multiple controversials things to kick the bots out of the game for an entire year, even if the game is almost empty of bots right now, the economy is RUINED FOR EVER. Marked by RMT and G2G, the prices are more expensive than in Korea, while Korea has more content and more gold than our servers.

The recent uptade where they introduced the new support class, the ""Artist"" was the worst mess I ever encountered in a game. Existing players like me with multiple supports in their rooster already, could not do raids, because they were just too much supports class. What a shame. We, the players, demand the Artist for more than 6 months, precisly because of lack of supports class in every content of the game and we did not get it until recently.

On my point of view, they should have released all classes (or almost) from Korea before any other content, so players can choose what they want from the beggining, and not wait 6 months or even a year the class they want to play.

To finish this review I will just say that the game is not ultimatly bad, I stayed because the gameplay is extraordinary, the story is not that bad. It could really be better and needs massive improvement, without all the things I listed and more.

By ""good experience"" i mean you will be able to enter a raid group soon surely (player base is very gatekeepy) and you need a meta build in order to join most groups unless you want to pay in game currency for someone else to play for you.

There is also very little social aspect as people only want the best players. The guild system makes it very difficult to actually have a group of people to talk to, as each of your characters can be in the same or a different guild and there are limited spots. The raids are usually really dry with no one really interacting with each other except for necessary info to do the raid.

People can be quick to end raid or kick others if they mess up because there is so much to do in the game you need to manage your time if you want to do almost everything every day. 

I also absolutely hate the dailies as they sometimes require you to change your build in order to do them faster and take super long if you have more than one or two characters. And if you're not spending its normal to have ~6 characters just to keep up, with ~4-5 of them at lower item level funneling resources into your main.

Let me preface this by making it clear that I never played Overwatch 1.  On Steam I have 40 some odd hours, but in reality I've been playing since the launch of OW2 on Battle.NET and have logged nearly 1200 hours total.  

I get the hate at launch, the game was barebones and lacked real purpose.  I get the hate after the scrapped PVE.  After 18 seasons I've seen the game in some really horrible states, but right now?  It's actually so good.  Stadium offers variety, the perk system completely changed the flow of matches.  It's more polished and reactive than Marvel Rivals is, and that's not up for debate.  It's also incredibly well optimized.  

There's still a myriad of problems, but the core game is to a state where they seem trivial.  The monetization is kind of gross but the game is free-to-play, you don't have to engage with it if you don't want to.  In it's current state, I absolutely reccomend it.  It's fast, fun, and addicting.  That could change in a season or two, who knows--  but I think this is the best the game has been since launch.",1758867153,2703.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.4935897290706634

During holidays I finally wanted to enjoy some other games and after the bad start 2 years ago I tried to give it a chance at all. Well, after playing some missions and spend some hours to the game I can say that they improved things (that were messed up at the beginning) but there are still some lacks:
- bot commands/bot AI is still so annoying.. if you play solo they still run towards you and idk why you still have no opportunity to hold bots at a certain spot (e.g. to wait on a specific spot)
- the overhauled skill system is new and sure its better than the beginning ones, but there is still a lack on content to personalize it more
- huge lack of content: after 2 years there are still a few maps and just couple new ones (DLCs) for which you have to pay for. For me it feels like just a money grabbing, greeding move and not the expected ""Payday 3"" content everyone wished
- there are way to less weapons for beginners.. after 2 years playing Payday 3 there is literally one weapon to choose and to play for (idk) the first 15-20 levels? give beginners the opportunity to move forward, unlock more weapons and to ""buy"" extensions e.g. silencers at the beginning. It is quite impossible to play stealth for beginners which is quite annoying
- performance is improved but I got some hitches even with a 9800x3d +rtx 5080 but its way better compared to the messy beginning xD

They did a lot correct with its stealth system; they majorly overhauled it and made it much more fun to do a mission in stealth, and the Payday team knows this because they request content creators to showcase this when sponsored to play the game.

A major mistake The Payday team made was that they removed too much, especially from the loadout menu. Payday 2 had a much larger variety of weapons, including akimbo (duel-wielded) weapons than Payday three, and the system of buying weapons is through vendors, but the way they organize the weapons is messy and confusing. They also removed a major mechanic from the game, perk decks, which  the lack thereof ruined my enjoyment of the game. Additionally, the Payday team decided to completely remove all melee customization and effectively made melee useless, which I was very disappointed to learn.

1272080,False,"Because it's not on the Steam page (as far as I can tell), this game contains many AI generated textures and assets. Maybe these got removed in the months I've stopped playing this live service game I pre-ordered but it's important to know this was ever a part of the process at all even if it gets reverted. The fact that at any stage of the map design process, AI is used, is a very bad indicator of the overall quality of the release product that you have to PAY MONEY FOR. Not a single good original map in this game and some of the maps they've taken from other games, they've only made worse. Check out the obviously AI generated city maps on the Houston Breakout heist that they released alongside a UI update that basically only meaningfully added a city map like in Payday 2. 

This game sucks. Don't buy it. Go play Payday 1 if you want some quality Christmas friendslop. As a huge Payday fan I'm mad this series was important enough to me to have wasted the first thing I bought my first paycheck being Payday 3: Gold Edition. That's the most interesting heist I can think of related to this game. Of all of the worst live service games in the past couple years this has been the most pathetic. I knew the soul was gone when they replaced Eric Etebari, Dallas' PD2 actor, a guy who vocally loved and was very passionate about his role as Dallas, promoted the game during development, interacted with fans a ton, whose face is literally like the first thing you saw in Payday 2.

It's going to sell to Running With Scissors. 10C probably won't be interested. They probably know not to sell it to Bo Andersson. Starbreeze's habit of being slavjank wearing a fake Gucci belt pretending to be way richer than they actually are has FINALLY caught up to them. They're going to come out with a new AI assistant called ShadeGPT to replace the FBI Files, to be announced in 2 months and added to the game heavily stripped down from what was announced after 8, with a future update said to release very soon then quietly cancelled a year later despite being ""near completion"" for months at a time. The cancellation of an offline mode is basically Starbreeze grabbing you, the person paying for the experience of riding Payday 3 Airlines, and jumping out of the plane hoping you can knit a parachute out of what cash is in your wallet so that you both can land safely. Some people might be more willing to knit that parachute.

The game we ended up with at launch was a horrible, quarter baked, miserable excuse for a sequel. At this point in the game's life, it has only just gotten around to fixing up the horrendous launch state of the skill system. The weapons themselves are still underwhelming and fail to show useful stats, not to mention the mediocre feel of their attachments. Enemy AI is still braindead and somehow feel worse than they used to at launch. The technical side of the game is an absolute mess, with some day 1 issues such as civilians clipping through floors and the unreasonably unstable servers still being just as bad as they were 2 years ago. DLCs are still costly and there's little content aside from quarterly releases, leaving the game in extended droughts. Not to mention the AI slop they've dropped on social media, they seem to be doing the best they can to ruin the game as much as possible.

1272080,False,"I think Payday 3 is fun. I think it has improved quite a lot since launch. However, I cannot, in good conscience, give this game a recommendation.

I have been patient with this game. I've played it despite its flaws, despite being a clearly inferior game to both its predecessors. I've waited through all the controversies for the game to get better. And it has gotten better: we've had Armor 2.0 which actually made armor interesting to use, and we've also had Skills 2.0, which removed the asinine Edge/Grit/Rush system and completely revamped a lot of the skills in a way that made the game much more fun to play... in loud in particular. Yeah, sorry stealth players...

But every time Payday 3 updates, I feel like the monkey paw curls one of its fingers. A big update happened? We're also cancelling offline mode! New heist? By the way, Almir Listo, the most recognizable face of Payday himself, leaves the company! Skills 2.0 update came out? Here, buy our plushie and look at our AI slop! Also, that's the only content you're getting for the rest of the year. Merry flocking Christmas heisters!

And those are just a few of the ones that I remembered off the top of my head. It just doesn't stop. This game is cursed to take a step in the right direction, only to jump right into traffic and get hit by a truck. The Advent Calendar event is the straw that broke the camels back for me that made me write this review. How do you make a 25-day event with content for every day, and deliver just one update of in-game content? The amount of teasers we were getting kind of led me to think we might actually get a heist. And my expectations were as low as low can be by this point. When the event began, I thought we'll get the Skills 2.0 update and a gun; not even a heist. [i]We didn't even get that.[/i]

And this is a relatively small gripe, but why is Teddy Moo so damn forced all of a sudden? In the almost 15 year history of this franchise, Teddy Moo made his debut in No Mercy in PD:TH, he re-emerged in the remake of No Mercy for PD2, then he got a mask in PD2 and an outfit in PD3. That's four times he's even mentioned in the franchise, and only two of which where he's actually played a role in a heist (both of which are the same heist in different games, mind you), in almost 15 years! And now you're expecting everyone to just accept him as the new mascot of the Payday franchise? Get out of here with that contrived nonsense! Let me give you four words that you could work with to use as mascots: ""Dallas,"" ""Hoxton,"" ""Wolf,"" and ""Chains."" The original four heisters, the ones who's faces are all over this entire franchise, aren't good enough anymore?

So, no. I cannot recommend this game. Not until Starbreeze and OVK get it together and actually focus on making the game better and not showing half-hearted efforts to appeal to your fans in trying to keep the franchise alive by any means necessary. The 180 they have to pull on this game has to be on the level of Cyberpunk 2077 or No Man's Sky, but I really don't see that happening.

I'm otherwise a relatively patient person. I've been waiting for a sequel to something I love for well over a decade now, and I thought I could wait until Payday 3 could get to the point where I can happily recommend it to my friends. Unfortunately, this game has stretched my patience so thin that I don't think that day will ever come. So all I can do, at this point, is to keep following this game until the inevitable death knell rings.

1272080,False,"As a massively obsessed fan of PD:TH and PD2, PD3 is an absolute disappointment compared to its predecessors even after 2 years of its release. Game lacks so much content in every department, many features that made PD2 as fun as it is replayable are missing such as perk decks, and the overall experience was just a massive ""Meh"". 

Here were the things that PD3 improved from PD2:

-Visuals are obviously a massive improvement. Texture details are actually detailed. Environments feel more vibrant and life-like, and textures don't look like MS Paint generated geometrics anymore. 

-Gunplay feels so nice and punchy. I feel the weight and ""oomph"" of shooting, and the sound design and animations of the gunplay are definitely satisfactory. The way guns feel here actually feels similar to Battlefield 6 for me, for some reason.

-Movement is a lot more fluid and responsive. I feel fast when I sprint, and I go wherever I input myself to go. No issues on movement. Also, instead of spamming sprint+jump+crouch in PD2, they added sliding, which is neat.

-Interaction animations are cool. Every specific interaction depending on the object or task has their own specific animation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It isn't that static no-hands display on every interaction like PD2 anymore.

-Overkill weapons are a nice touch.

-Stealth is SO MUCH BETTER. You can finally interact and do what you need to do without the need to mask in. Guards feel more natural, and they don't phase through solid walls anymore or see you through 2 layers of concrete to detect you. Also, being able to answer the pager while carrying the body? I love it.

-The game does feel more ""high-octane"" than PD2, which I do enjoy and expected for PD3. It feels more adrenaline-inducing, and I do still get that iconic rush of a Payday game.

-Haven't encountered any bugs so far, so I assume most the bugs on release were already addressed by now.

Here are the things PD3 has downgraded from PD2:

-Obviously, content. Ever 2 years later from release, there is still an absolute content drought. Fewer heists than PD2 even on that game's release. There are way too few guns to play with, and even with the new Skill Tree 2.0 update, the skill trees still feel bare and minimum to me. The sandbox mayhem you could enjoy from PD2 is missing in PD3. Also, no perk decks. What the fuck?

-Heists feel way too short. I noticed that in a span of one hour, I was able to finish 5 heists. That's roughly 12 minutes only per heist. Compared to PD2, where a heist can take as long as 45 minutes, even one day heists. Speaking of, please bring back multi-day heists.

-Heists weren't memorable at all. A number of PD2 heists actually had weight to them, and some of them stuck to me to this day, such as Hoxton breakout, Hotline Miami, Birth of Sky, Shadow Raid, and many more. In PD3, I play through a heist, and I don't feel much anything afterwards. I just felt the heists were mostly just a get-in, smash some things and take loot, and escape. Them being short as well added to their blandness. They just didn't feel good.

-Heist mechanics are okay. Still has the usual do this and do that to open this and access that type of flow. I say downgrade in the sense that there isn't any improvement from PD2. However, the heists mostly lack on the random nature that PD2 heists have especially on things like objective item spawns, making the replayability of each heist in PD3 just boring and static. I'm just doing and expecting the same thing over and over again.

-Difficulty? Where's that? I don't know, I only reached level 29 but I'm already able to breeze through overkill difficulty even without a completed skill tree. The game definitely feels WAY TOO EASIER. I noticed that, atleast for me, in increasing difficulty, the only thing that also increases is just the number of spawns. Damage felt more or less the same across all difficulties. The game didn't feel challenging enough for me to enjoy. You know the posture where you start leaning forward in your seat and focus your eyes to the monitor and lock in? I never experienced it in my 4 hours at the time of writing this review, even playing on Overkill difficulty.

-Police AI feels stale. I don't know how to describe it exactly, but they just feel more bland and unengaging. I don't get that same feeling of being overwhelmed like in PD2. It's like they only just spawn, and move a bit and shoot, as if they only exist just for something for you to left click at. Even special enemies, especially bulldozers, feel underwhelming.

-No infamy or prestige system, which adds to it's already poor replayability.

-PD3 is slowly developing a DLC infestation like PD2. The new content in this game aren't being released as free updates, but as all DLC. The recent DLC, for example, is just a heist. And it's cost at full price is not justified at all. I hope starbreeze makes future content mostly free updates, with a only a bare minimum of paid DLCs here and there if they need to.

-Due to the aforementioned downgrades I noticed, as well as many other factors, PD3 has an abysmal player count even with crossplay on. On the server browser, I usually find like only 8-ish heist lobbies every refresh. Sure that's good enough to find lobbies, and I do still get players joining my lobby when I host. However, in some heists I just end up playing with the same people.

There definitely are many other more issues with the game, but these were just the things that really made the game worse for me.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have played both PD:TH and PD2 for an unhealthy amount of hours, and they were the best CO-OP shooters I have ever played, with most of my hours sunk into PD2 despite it's poorly optimized, DLC infested, unbalanced content. Still, it was peak co-op heisting for me.

When the first trailer for Payday 3 was dropped, being hyped was an absolute understatement. I couldn't wait to get my hands on Payday 3 and see what Starbreeze has added to the heisting scene, seeing as how successful Payday 2 was. However, I have a personal rule that I usually wait 2 months after a game's release to see how well it performs, and usually 2 months is a good enough time to assess player retention after release. I was honestly fighting the biggest urge to purchase the game on release as I really just wanted to jump into the game immediately. Oh boy, was I right not to surrender myself to temptation.

In a nutshell, the game flopped HARD on release. The game got ""Mostly Negative"" reviews, and everyone, including my favorite PD content creators such as GeneralMcBadass, said the game was a buggy, content-deficient, lackluster experience. The first few months of the game was horrible, as what I've seen online.

I decided to let the game refine itself for a year before deciding to buy the game, as I had hoped by then that Starbreeze would have enough time to address all the issues. One year later, game still has shit reviews with mostly the same concerns such as poor content. So I gave it another year.

I mostly forgot about the game, and only remembered it this winter sale. Now the reviews improved, but it's only Mixed. From what I've heard, the recent update on skill trees was a step in the right direction, as well as people saying it's a lot better than release. So, seeing as it was 50% off anyways, I decided to grab it. Played 4 hours worth, and I did not thoroughly enjoy those 4 hours.

What happened, Starbreeze? PD3 had SO MUCH potential to be one of the greatest in the CO-OP genre. PD2's formula was a smash hit, so it came to no surprise that the expectations for PD3 were quite high. But by God, was this game an absolute underdelivery. I still have glimmers of hope that maybe you could turn this around, as I am among this franchise's most loyal and absolute fans. The games were my childhood, but even someone like me can't defend this slop.",1766854809,246.0,True,False,False,5,0,0.5244118571281433

1272080,True,"Not sure whether to give a thumbs up or down. But I'll summarise what I think so far, I bought this game on sale in 2024 as I have played Payday 1 and 2 with friends before. In 2024 the game was still pretty bad and quite boring. Today as of December 2025. I can say the game is better, there are good DLCs for heists at least out, so some content is there, no where near as many as Payday 2 but that is understandable as that game is like over 10 years old.

What is most lacking is guns right now. Otherwise the gameplay is really addictive and fun, especially the stealth. The solo mode is also playable now, unlike in 2024 where is was extremely unbalanced.

So what is still bad? Well the game is a live service always online bullsh*t game. Unlike its two predecessors. Well why is this bad? This means if Starbreeze ever stops supporting this game, then its dead, especially if they shut the servers down, then you can't even access it anymore... There is no modding scene, so even the community can't add heists or other game modes or guns, and make the game more fun. So unlike Payday 1 and 2, this game actually has an expiration date.

For now I will give it a thumbs up, the game was bad before, but I will commend the devs for at least sticking with it and making it better. Just find away to get the game out of the servers and make it more moddable and it could be peak.",1766737795,345.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The game plays differently to it's predecessor. While I'd say payday 2 is more like a sandbox almost where you can mess around with different perk decks, weapons and skills to enhance said weapons and some other gameplay elements while also shooting a bunch of enemies with enough variety ( I will admit though that the lack of the medic unit in payday 3 is a good thing but the inclusion of new ones like the nader or techie has been done poorly ) and the game being overall chaotic ( and fun ), this game is taking things slower when it comes to action and limits the things you can mess around with. Overall I would recommend getting payday 2 over payday 3, especially during a sale where you can get a LOT of content in the second game for a fair price ( that cannot be said about payday 3 which lacks content that is worthwhile to this day).",1766675334,2942.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.5238095521926879

OVERALL: I used to love playing Payday 2 every single day on my Xbox one. I've actually had a really fun time on this game. Sure, this game is not even close to Payday 2 but if this game is on sale and you're looking for something fun. I'm sure you'll have a good time on this game. The worst part about this game is the always online factor of this game. If this game stops getting support from these servers, there could be a high chance of this game going unplayable. I would give this game a 6.5/10.

1272080,True,"To be honest this game isn't perfect by any means but I love it. The potential with this game is very high but I feel like the developers don't really see the problem and are trying to fix issues which aren't the main ones. I know the team has a lack of funding so I am a bigger supporter owning almost every DLC for the game. The new skill system is the first step in the right direction I have seen since the game came out. The next step for the developers is to make the game more arcade like and add cool but stupid features. Stuff like that is what makes Payday what it is. In payday 2 you could bring an explosive crossbow to a heist and dominate with it or you could use a giant spoon and kill cops with it. The point is the game is trying to be too ""realistic."" The new skill system really helps because it makes not one build the best but it is up to the player to decide what they want to do. I think they should also expand on the overkill weapons because I feel those have a lot of potential as well. The next best way to make the game more ""arcade like"" is to add stupid but good and funny weapons and playstyles.",1766436577,6951.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5129870176315307

1272080,False,"I’d recommend Payday 3 as a cure for boredom, assuming you’re comfortable trading it in for constant irritation as a side effect, due to its overall bland game design, mediocre and poorly executed heist ideas, imbalanced difficulty, and plainly dumb enemy behavior design.

Seriously, why did they ditch the traditional but effective Cloaker design? It went from quiet horror to a kamikaze, respawning annoyance with wallhacks.",1765955188,2067.0,True,False,False,2,2,0.4956896305084228
1272080,True,"Is a fun enough time to roll around in. Better if you have some friends, still works well without. Gunplay's solid and there's enough variety in guns and skill loadouts to play differently. Biggest weakness is the heist selection doesn't feel super strong. Hard to pin down why. With Payday 2's colossal heist pedigree its hard to be objective given how long that game had to mature. I'd pick up Payday 2 one way or another, if you play that game to death like I have Payday 3 may have some legs. As a standalone game, 3 is pretty good. It's just damn hard to live up to 2, but its getting there.

For one thing, the new skills update is a *massive* boon for the game. The former skill system was deeply flawed with well-intentioned choices to make the fluid line-system work with using the Edge, Grit, and Rush mechanic as a way to try to glue it together. While I think in a different world it could've worked well, having things like ""Shoot 35 bullets"" and ""Swap your weapons"" be methods to gain Edge, it had a deep micromanagement problem. This just wasn't fun to deal with and didn't achieve the goals they were going for with trying to push for certain playstyles enabling skills.

Now, it's the tried and true: Skill trees with a focus per branch and increasing point cost. No more dealing with getting buffs through odd actions, things either just work or work off of way more straightforward triggers. Much cleaner and simpler to setup a build and overall covering more gameplay options than before. The differing skill point costs also fixed most loadouts being a muddy mix of core overachieving skills plus some random junk thrown in there. Skill setups are much more focused now which defines playstyles a whole lot better.

Cobbling together loadouts was what attracted me to come back for a bit. Just wanted to throw out that I greatly appreciate this skill overhaul because *mother of god* did I hate the old system.

1) Just get us back to P2P networking/local saves at this point. Get us PD2 Crime.net, gut the shitty systems you have and fuck off. Never would I have guessed a dedicated server implementation can be so cursed.

2) Go back and play the older games. QR codes, domination capture points, and all the tedious silly mini games need to be taken out back. Let key cards and stealth elements be hidden and very randomized. Not everything needs an outline or follow the same rigid stealth structure. and yes rework all the heists to have unique gameplay.

3) Start incorporating obvious QoL mods, restore PD2 elements like the font and some UI elements instead of the ones present that feel pulled out of an UE4 template.

4) All the VA is awful, Add more radio distortion, remove the cringe jokes/banter and straight up replace them with an interesting new set of characters.

Get your heads out of the sand, quit ignoring the obvious pain points and avoiding doing right by the game and the people who supported you for long term exploitation and monetization (guarantee you that you will never have a successful mtx store and you have lost so much money and interest from insisting on trying to police DLC unlockers and you wont get 75% of it back even if everything goes incredibly well from here on out) or its your jobs on the line.

**“Payday 3: Fun Heists, Slow Fixes”**

Payday 3 has some great ideas — the gunplay feels solid, the movement is smoother, and when a heist actually comes together, it feels amazing. The teamwork moments hit hard, and the style is definitely there.

But the game launched missing a lot of what made Payday 2 legendary, and even now it still feels like it’s catching up. Limited content, weird progression, and matchmaking issues drag down what could’ve been a top-tier co-op heist experience.

It’s fun *when everything works*, but it doesn’t always work.

1272080,True,"It took a while, but they really pulled this game around on most fronts. Slowly, I've watched it become a worthier successor to its predecessor, Payday 2. Which let me clarify, is still the goat in comparison. But Payday 3 now offers a lot more than it did on its flop of a launch.

An array of skill changes, followed by the inevitable Armor and Skill 2.0, coupled with a multitude of weapon adjustments, balances, several much needed quality of life additions, and gameplay tweaks make this a whole different game. 

Its a lot of fun for a few heists whenever I have a minute, regardless of my style of heisting that day. Everything here feels well crafted, and finely tuned. Though, its come at the steep cost of quantity. 20 bite sized heists that pack a punch, but will leave you wishing there was more.

This moment, Payday 3 is a great albeit short, crime fueled romp for friends who want something cathartic, and don't mind the edgy virtual violence of shooting through a police station or even an New York State court house.

Alternatively though, it can be for the gamer who wants a fresh challenge for their brain, to be a ghost and stealthily rob the rich or corrupt from under their noses with a cool crew of likeminded heisters.

Its a lot of fun, and after several short breaks playing regularly since its utter tragedy of a release, I can say confidently that Payday 3 has massively improved, the develops slowly having crafted a version that pales in comparison to what we have now.

The lack of any offline mode in the event of an eventual server shutdown is still frustrating and a perpetual issue however, and is always a huge disclaimer I like to give for Payday 3.

1272080,False,"So I don't usually write reviews to game unless they really impress me or they disappoint me completely, sadly, this is one of the later cases so let me begin with my issues towards the game:

- I wasn't really waiting for this game to be honest, I was thinking from the beginning it's a bad idea to push out another game when payday never needed a ""new game"", it just needed some update to it's second game to keep it up to date visually and mechanically.

- I've played payday 2 for a very long time and it's been my favourite game and first game on steam, I made a steam account just for payday and since then even if they had some attempts at greedyness, I loved every second of it, bought every dlc individually, was there for all the new update, everything new added to the game, hearing about payday 3 made me think they are giving up on payday 2 entirely which they didn't because they added a monthly subscription to give all the dlcs while having the monthly subscription, so I guess fuck the hundreds of dollars I gave for dlcs cuz now everybody can have everything for just 9.99 euros a month... ofc after you buy the base game.

- I understand thet they wanted to make the game more ""realistic"" but they somehow managed to make it completely out of immersion, the arcadey payday 2 had me more immersed than this game ever had, I still come in every update thinking ""even payday 2 had a bad start but they improved"" but every update I'm trying to find reasons to not quit the game and sticking to payday 2 but I'm finding it almost impossible

- servers and network are a joke, why did they ever think even solo mode needs to find a server to host the game is beyond my understanding, feels like they got their server knowledge from ubisoft and they still somehow made it worse than them.

- I don't really have anything good to say about the game, it's mechanics are dreadful, it's gameplay is boring, the updates are exciting but then you get disappointed because the delivery is lackluster or doesn't feel like it improved on anything, I always liked starbreeze and tried finding a excuse for them but at this point, they had the whole community supporting them when they almost went bankrupt and then they still treat their costumers the way they do, I understand they need a source of income to pay people and resources, but at this point I'd rather have starbreeze focus on other projects and just admit payday franchise is just dead, they don't deserve your money or attention anymore, keep your money and spend it on something else.

1272080,False,"I really don't know what to say about this game 
(sorry in advance if some stuff that i said is confusing because English is not my first language) 

- at launch day, the game is pretty much a solid game with a clear vision of what PD3 want to be but got ruined because of lack of contents and being in unplayable state (i know this is highly the cause of plaion want to rushed the launch day to gain profit but this really hurt the game future in the long run as we can see even after 2 years) 
- after 1 years, the game has got a decent amount of contents with 4 main chapter DLC, it still lack of contents but this is way better than launch day and this is when i actually start telling people you can finally support PD3 and try the game
- the introduction of armor 2.0 is a very good start, it open the door for the fan base of PD2 BUT still keeping the core armor system of PD3 which is a good thing since it don't just outright abandon the original vision of PD3
- after ton of delay and lack of updates for another years, sbz announced skill 2.0. This is one of the worst system i ever saw for multiple reasons:
+ outright abandon the original vision of PD3 with the removal of EGR systems (edge - grit - rush).
+ remove the all of the gimmick skill that make PD3 gameplay stand out compare to other FPS games.
+ remove the variety of build making and just rewarding you for dumping all of your skill point into 3 skill tree that lock behind weapon, armor and throwable to gain the most out of it.
+ now all of the skill is mostly just passive so you barely actually work to gain the benefit from it.
+ all of the skill is outright unbalance and make the gameplay so shallow, so boring, so braindead that you must try to lose on the highest difficulty 
+ outright point a middle finger to the people that love the EGR systems for it unique.
+ this systems was made by the people that play stealth on normal and failed multiple time on loud while they are trying to showcase skill 2.0 on stream said a lot, these people have 0 clues how to balance a game.
+ it so unpolished and rushed that nothing sync together like the whole thing is holding by duct tape.

1272080,True,"I think the game is at a point where I would start recommending it to people, especially with the recent ""Skills 2.0"" update. And for context, I played the game when it first launched; bugs, issues and all.

The game has come a long way from it's launch with the addition of a couple things that I saw that I thought were notable. First was the ability to play in a ""Solo"" game. You no longer need to wait to connect to server, which massively improved load time. And when you have to restart a mission for any reason, there's no massive wait time like there was before. Which is a big plus for me.

I understand people are still upset about the fact that you need to be online in order to play the game at all, but that's not really a deal breaker for me.

Now with ""Skills 2.0"" update, the game feels a lot better. We're back to the old Payday 2 skill tree system, and I am here for it. Old builds from Payday 2 are now possible in the game. Not to the same extent as they were in Payday 2, but they are present. There's no longer a need to unlock individual skill sets, which makes customization a lot smoother and take less time. 


There are some things I think the game still needs to improve on, but I think so far that everything is moving in the right direction and is being set up for these changes.

Firstly, the loadout system needs reworked. I would love there to be a way I could go without armor entirely, that way I could get the most out of the certain skills. Additionally, it can be a bit confusing trying to find the weapons I want, so something I would like to see is some weapon organization or filter implemented. 

Secondly, the new skill system still needs some tweaks and work done to it before it can be called perfect, but it is a colossal step in the right direction. Certain skills need altered or buffed, while other skills can be reworked as other changes are implemented. 

But at the end of the day, I think the game is ready to come back into the light. It's now where it should be by no means, but it's making the necessary corrections to get there and I'm happy for it. I don't want to see this game die, and I want nothing more than to see it make a return No Man's Sky style. I think that would be spectacular.",1764963564,2395.0,True,False,False,1,1,0.4950494766235351

""No I meant Payday 3! Silly.""

""Nooo, they fixed that! Now you level normally!""
> Ohh, so just the game where armor is a finite and shit resource to manage then?
""Nope, we fixed that too with Armor 2.0 (finally!)""

Depending on how you approach it you can make a bunch of varied options and builds for specific situations...Maybe this isn't quite as bad as everyone said it was! and the unmasked/stealth/hostages aspect is a lot better than 2's!

[Fast Forward to December, 2025]

Hey, here's this new system that our survey says EVERYONE loves more than edge grit and rush!
> looks inside
> Every synergy or build concept (that Bias: I enjoyed) is now divided over 2-3 subsections, stuffed with a ton of filler combat perks for specific weapons/grenades, and that's it. 
> You need to be level 150 for the *51* perk points, basically half of which you spend to acquire *2*, arguably 3 actual perks that benefit stealth (pre-mask/pre-cop) gameplay, and the other half being nerfed hacker/  severely nerfed grifter (getting to that).
> Oh, did you enjoy having smoke grenades? That's the Ninja tree now. You'd think a Ninja would have throwing knives, but sorry, that's lumped in with Medic/Grifter. Want to pair engineering with a chunky rifle for killing Dozers? I hope you didn't want armor, or hacking with that, because you're already splitting between 2 if not 3 ""classes"". Oh, you *like* hostage taking? And the only grenade that helps with civy management is flashbangs? Well- do you like *ammo boxes?!* because that's the synergy with Hostage Taking! 
> Transporter, Adrenaline, Grifter, Thief, Marks, Takedowns, Quickdraw/Desperado pistol setups- ENTIRE trees are smashed down into 1 or 2 perks, usually far weaker than whatever they offered before. 

""But you have 51 skill points now, instead of 28 before!""

> I can, if I trim out every quality of life, recover 50-60% of the build(s) I enjoyed before, and almost none of what I can recover or keep pertains to pre-loud gameplay. And now the game expects me to let it control my loadout, because ""Why would you ever want Shotgun perks as a hostage taker, or assault rifle perks with some medical fallback""
> Did you want to be able to move loot good for your crew? *20+* of your 51 points are spent on acquiring *just* the ability to carry 2 bags without penalty, and quickly jimmy/punch a lock. Yeah, you get some benefits to armor bags and thicker armor! ...and also dodge!....which wants you.. to have...less armor...

It feels like the devs for Payday called up Cyberpunk and asked if they could copy the homework. The New Tree shows some promise, and maybe with enough care and effort you could build something fun or at least funny. 
Hey, at least we'll actually get more deployable bags than just what we start with, that could at least be cool!

(Read the patch notes, they already have that skill on the chopping block for ""2.1"", along with some other nerfs pre-planned with ""community approval/suggestion"")

Yes, I saw you can throw a knife while masked off. Can't move the guard's body, though, unless they let you carry corpses unmasked, and losing a lot of camera control or stealth movement from *entire trees* that provided assets to stealth being squashed or removed...

I'd be more willing to consider this new system if they give us an extra 24 points, making it 75- that would let you get *most* of 3 separate trees of your choice [u] regardless [/u] of Starbreeze's idea of what makes a good synergy; and giving back that build freedom to choose your weapons based on what you enjoy, not what the game says you should. It would allow a smidge of wiggle-room for such overpowered perks as ""You don't have to play our lockpicking minigame"" without spending 1/5 of your character just to get that skill, or making those 7 point investments to ""capstone"" a tree, more valuable. 

With how much the skills cost now though, and how utterly dogshit stealth feels/looks at current, I can't defend this game any more.

1272080,False,"[h1] PAYDAY 3 takes a giant step away from its predecessor... and falls down the stairs, Peter Griffin style. [/h1]

Is the game fun to play when it works? Kinda. The game got better after the release with the introduction of reworked (PAYDAY 2-like) armor and skill systems. Stealth got more mechanically complicated with the introduction of different types of zones (Public, Private, and Secure), different types of civilians (normal Pedestrians and Employees), and the new Search phase that is now triggered first before the alarm (which throws out of the window all timings and paths of guards, so you have to be much more careful). And switching the difficulty feels more impactful than in the 2nd part, where playing on Mayhem is pretty much the same as on Death Sentence. 

Loud also feels very different. Shooting got some weight added to it, SWAT units actually try to hide behind Shields, Cloakers are like toddlers with knives running around, Bulldozers can be a problem when there are a lot of enemies around, and Tasers... well, they are also here. On top of that there are 2 more new special units (Grenadier that throws toxic grenades that damage your health directly, and Drone Controller that hides somewhere in a corner and keeps launching multiple kinds of drones), which is nice, but in general the Loud part of the game is quite easy. Even on higher difficulties with randoms you can escape with a stealth build once one of them triggers the lasers in a vent where they had absolutely nothing to do. 

But the rest of it, outside of the gameplay, is still broken and much worse than the second part. First of all, the game is online-only. Allegedly, to prevent players from cheating (you can check videos on YouTube to see how ""well"" that is working). Does it introduce problems? Of course it does!
- Creating a contract takes 30+ seconds.
- Restarting the contract doesn't change anything (same spawns of items, same codes, same everything), most likely because of the previous point. 
- If the server crashes (and it will) - the host will also get disconnected.
- If joining a lobby fails - sometimes it takes time to go back to the [noparse]Crime.net[/noparse], sometimes you have to ""re-login"".

And the UI isn't much better:
- In-lobby chat is somehow worse than in the 2nd part.
- There is no level filter for your lobbies. Low levels will frequently join Overkill Stealth just to start blasting guards (and playing solo is boring).
- As far as I can see, you cannot join random lobbies with the DLC heists you don't own. You can still see them in the [noparse]Crime.net[/noparse], but instead of the ""Join"" button, there is a banner that tells you to buy the DLC, which is just scummy in my opinion. You can disable specific heists in the filters... but they reset each time you open the menu, so that's useless.
- In the inventory, instead of pages of weapons or masks, we now have a scrollable list with 2 columns, which is incredibly annoying to use and shows only 8 items at once.
- Weapon upgrading also uses a horizontal scrollable list, that is way too wide.
- When buying a weapon - for some reason it shows you a list of all of them (both Primary and Secondary).
In general some of the menus feel like a mobile game menus that weren't properly ported to PC.

There were many problems when this game started, but now times have changed; some of those may be fixed, but the problem still remains. They have not learned and are repeating their mistakes and are now poisoning Payday 2 with there new idea's.

Come release day and I remember it was plagued with tons of issues I cannot for the life of me remember but I know it was server issues and such and then realizing it was always online, I can't remember if it was stated before release or not but that was a huge blow knowing that if you are ever without internet you are just locked out of playing the game you bought.

Despite all the issues I still found myself having fun with the game even if I was growing bored of the lack of content and such. Fastforward to present day its still online only but there is more content and weapons to sink your teeth into and I find myself wanting to come back to this game everynow and again, does that mean its good? No. I'd say its okay for where it is now, theres a fair few heists and fun weapons to play with. At the time of writing this ""Skills 2.0"" was announced that will probably fix the issue of the skills feeling lackluster and feeling as though they do nothing.

Yeah, the game doesn’t have a ton of support right now, and it’s definitely been a rough ride at times.

Lasers, loot bags, hostages screaming, alarms blaring—chef’s kiss.

they release next to no actual content, opting to instead sell the game piecemeal to us in packages that are not even remotely worth it

1. Online only for no reason at all, this game was meant to be online only for an item store, OH, that item store isnt even in THE GAME.

2. Even with a redesign, most of the menus still suck,  primary and secondary weapons are seperated, but when you go to buy a weapon in the primary slot, it'll also show secondarys???? why????

3.  in payday 2 when someone has a bag, it shows on their name in the hud that is just not in payday 3, among with a million other things that arent in payday 3.

4. this is a minor grip but this game has a weapon bash but it does no damage which personally I just think is really stupid and idiotic lmao. alongside the LACK of meelee in general. The only melee being a fucking overkill drop...

5. You unlock weapon attachments by levelling up certain weapons which just no, this isnt fucking call of duty, I hated that shit in cod, i hate it here in Payday. 

6. again a minor nitpick but this game has no safehouse, which yeah in payday 2 its not all that useful, but you can atleast test weapon damage inside the safehouse and its got trophies you can unlock and show off. 

7. the payday 3 lobby system sucks, payday 2's was good, not this one. 

8.  The HUD. OH MY GOD THE HUD. LIKE THE REST OF THIS GAME, BLAND BORING SOULLES SHITTY I HATE ITTT.

9. No jukebox. 

10. the gunplay is okay, but enemies barely fucking spawn, outside areas arent populated at all.

1272080,True,"Work a second try. Definatly improved since I played the Beta

This isn't perfect but been having a good time with it playing with my mate. Still a learning curve with the new systems and mechanics, i imagine this not being an issue if you didn't sink hundreds of hours into PD2.

Personal Issues
 - Although I don't hate the new skill system, I don't like how almost everything ties into the EGDE, RUSH and GRIT mechanics. Most skills effectively act as buffs to these which is cool but they are on timers and some skills causes you to loose one of them as soon as you do something like vaulting. Meaning a lot of the time you're running without skills until you get one of these temp buffs. This means I'm building to maximumise the amount of time I have these buffs rather than crafting a playstyle (I have just seen that the Skills 2.0 update is coming soonish getting rid of this complaint but until I can play with it myself i will keep this point here. new update does look good though)
 - UI and Loadouts have seen an improvement but the weapon store specifically is a problem, Standard weapons are burried underneath DLC you may not own and premade weapons you can't customise (why would I want them if I can customise standard weapons I buy)
Also for some reason primary and secondary weapons are mixed together, instead of seperated into their own cateagory, just makes the weapon store look like a confusing mess
 - They seem to have added extra steps to every interaction, imagine doing something in PD2 now add extra steps. For example I dropped a USB into a computer and expected it to just go so I went straight to moving bags. What you need to do is put in the USB, start the transfer, wait, then complete it. each requiring you to hold to interact each step.
Same with drills, place drill. bolt it in (sometimes) wait, remove the drill, then open the door, again each step requiring your to hold interact, its unnecessary 
 - armour plates dont regen unless you have the impact plate but most skills exclude effects on these, meaning you have another limited resource to manage leading to moments where you have no armour, no way of replenishing it and no way to regen more health. (keep in mind I dont hate the bodyvest/armour plate system but it needs more work and more options)

Things I like
 - Gunplay is good
 - Missions are fun (if not a whole new level of pain on stealth with new mechanics)
They also ported classics from PD2 and PD1
 - Weapon, Mask, Loadout, mission and just the UI usability has been greatly improved for an alround better UX (with the exception of the weapon store mentioned earlier)
 - Customisation is good, would like to see more flexibility to paint individual parts how you want them but ultimately offers enough to satisfy most people. Be also nice to see more outfit options, maybe some more variations on outfits and with masks.

I can see why people don't hate PD3 but also don't love it either, but this is still a fun game and have genuinely been having a blast with it.
I also dont get all the hate for the Devs, yeah they fumbled the bag with PD3 but they are passionate about the franchise and we've seen theyll stick with and keep working on the game  constantly like they did with PD2. Altho it had a bad release this is definatly not a slop game. If the devs can keep afloat then I know that this review will be out of date in a few years time as they add content and tinker with the game. Wait for a sale if you must but definatly give this game a chance

1272080,False,"Payday 3 is objectively worse than Payday 2. I will change my review when Payday 3 is at least as good as Payday 2.

If you care about Payday 3, then force Starbreeze to make it better by leaving a negative review to impact their sales.

Payday 3's issues since Day 1:

Barely any heists
- We have only 16 (10 at launch) short heists with little replayability
- Very little RNG elements in heists, especially non-dlc heists
- Why can't we have Payday 2 level variety on how to complete heists (multiple escapes/breaches)?
- Payday 2 has over 70 heists

No Multiday Heists
- Payday 3 should have been released with at least 30 heists, 10 being multi-day

Most heists are short
- I can solo most in under 12 mins on the hardest difficulty easily

Live Service only
- Even Solo mode requires a ping before and after the game, often failing
- Matchmaking was terrible, became bad and is terrible again now with crimenet
- Want to host a lobby? Get ready to wait several minutes...
- random disconnections, single lost network packet can disconnect you
- 150ms lag feels like 600ms lag in any normal game
- 5 min heist loading
- UI freezes when loading, sometimes infinite
- long loading if 1 player has bad internet
- Sometimes instant disconnection after joining a lobby
- Still have the can't ready up bug sometimes

Obvious game breaking bugs take forever to fix:
- Cook off has had crashing issues since launch
- Cook off escape van IS STILL BROKEN since 9 months ago (maybe fixed today)
- Diamond District stuck door
- Invisible enemies
- Countless stuck objectives
- UE4 is a decade old and very stable, bad Starbreeze code crashing game
- It feels like little to no QA is done before releasing and update
- Forget PD2 hotfixes, never had any

No heists with large maps
- At least a 5/30 should be large maps

Few interesting heists
- No real creativity for the jobs the gang does
- Execution (ie drilling/hacking) is also pretty boring
- Why are there still wifi circles after a whole year???

No Preplanning
- Can only order basic assets without placing them

Many missing PD2 mechanics like driving

AI teammates are stupid
- Cannot be instructed to wait and don't help with objectives
- Sometimes don't even revive you if you are downed
- Often broken/stuck (Fear & Greed)
- Cannot have their loadouts, weapons or skills changed

Enemies are bland
- Crowds of bullet sponge swat that do little damage to players
- Only new special is the Nader (who was broken for most of this year)
- Tasers are now called Zappers and are barely a threat
- Only one variant of Bulldozer with an auto-shotgun
- Bulldozers can only target a single player and are slow to retarget

Cloakers are too buggy
- Attack through walls/corners
- Always target players even if you're the last one
- Can't be heard that well (were silent most of this year)
- Can only be stopped by a one shot kill when they close charge you
- Spawn from the same closest location every wave end so are easy to expect

Heisters to play as are lacking
- Only 7 playable heisters, PD2 has 22
- Voicelines are bland and few
- Barely any situational voicelines and no banter between heisters

Skills are super bland and boring
- No drill skills, Inspire, Joker, Pistol Messiah or any interesting skills for that matter
- I personally hate the new Armor plate economy, PD2 armor was perfect
- No perk decks to make cool builds
- No infamy system/rewards
- Too easy to become 150, other players' renown levels hidden
- Edge, Grit, Rush effects are an unnoticeable 10%

Music is acceptable but worse than PD2
- Only dlc heists have good music + Diamond District
- No ability to change heists' music
- No access to PD2/PDTH soundtrack

The UI is still bad
- No number stats of weapons in UI, have to look these up online
- Can't move guns around/sell preset guns
- Weapons have same inventory icon regardless of which mods/skins are on it
- Way too many large buttons/text which lead to unnecessary sub-pages and submenus
- Can't manage party/other players directly from main menu/esc screen
- No value of items shown when grabbed/secured
- Separate control for marking than interacting unlike PD2
- Kicked to main menu after heist (can opt-in and wait 60s to form party which nobody does)

Few weapons
- No melee weapons at all
- No saw
- Very few guns and the meta ones are all DLC
- Same high fire rate and one shot kill weapons used for Overkill
- No weapon lasers nor flashlights
- Weapon sights cannot have the reticle changed at all
- Secondary weapons all crazy suck except for DLC ones since Houston Breakout
- No exciting weapons like Flamethrower, RPG or medieval weapons
- Since day 1 we've begged to get rid of the OVK weapon system
- No weapon skins that allow you to freely change mods

Few Throwables
- Grenade barely does any damage
- No cool throwables except the shock grenade
- Only get 2 knives which break when hitting a wall

Few achievements:
- Despite the little content, there should still be more achievements

Equipment sucks
- Ecms are now useless, except disabling one camera you can reach
- Infrasonic mines that you manually detonate to temporarily stun instead of tripmines
- No c4
- Sentries are now a deployable so nobody uses them over Armor Bags

Few masks
- Most masks are overdone and feel too ridiculous to ever wear
- Very few patterns to choose from
- Preset masks cannot be customized
- No interesting materials
- No cool masks compared to PD2

No Deathwish
- Overkill is way too easy, never had to first play other difficulties
- FBI van is stupid easy

Modifiers can't be changed
- For the last few months, almost every heist has the 2 specials and blinding shield modifiers
- I would like to enable all of them for more pay, they can't be changed

Pros over PD2 (this is why I would accept at least 30 heists vs PD2's 70 at launch)
+ Graphics gorgeous compared to PD2 but very unoptimized (ppl with 4080s are getting lag spikes)
+ Mask off stealth has more depth but now stealthing is way too easy
+ More heists with code locks which are cool to guess
+ Hostage system is better
+ Final Wave mechanic to make securing all loot harder
+ Fixed Naders are a cool threat
+ Bulldozers can melee kick and charge players
+ Cool animations when doing most interactions
+ Microcams/motion sensors useful and pretty cool
+ Shields have window to take them out through",1760812790,3439.0,True,False,False,7,0,0.5916794538497924

1272080,True,"There's a hell of a lot in PD3 that should be improved, and there are very many very valid complaints to be made about its development, or lack thereof. The last 2 years of new content and reworks have done a lot of good, but PD3 is nowhere near where it could - and should, really - be. Putting that to one side, I love this game.

I'm going to make comparisons to the last game because it's what most people know and/or are coming from, including myself; I'm >1500 hours deep in PD2.

PD2 has this licked for sheer volume and variety of content, for innate replayability, and for most things you could try to measure, but I always have more fun playing PD3. Why? Well, this is how it feels to me. PD2 has a huge amount of good quality content and a well sorted progression system, but this is overshadowed by its consistently clunky, awkward, and dated gameplay. PD3 is comparatively anaemic with flawed, poorly developed systems, but is at its core a more refined and better feeling experience.

The standout improvements are to the core combat and gunplay. Gone are huge swarms of brain-dead bullet sponge cops. Shots-to-kill feel now intentionally thought out and reasonable, and no longer change significantly between difficulties. Enemies now act and react in half believable ways, and spawnrates are more manageable.
Almost all weapons look, sound, and feel amazing to use. The step up over PD2 is massive; no more reused reload animations, ugly models, or desynced auto-fire sounds! 
Add to these things the less floaty movement and new first-person animations for interactions, and what you have is a player character that feels better to control in combat that feels better to engage with, and in a game that is much better to look at.
Could you believe it, even, that the awful armour system that PD3 released with has since been reworked into something better than PD2's? And there's still a good amount of PAYDAY personality to the music, heists, and characters.

Like I said earlier, I do feel this game needs a lot of work. I acknowledge and am very often dealing with its problems. My experience would be much improved if these problems were worked on, but as PD3 stands, that experience is still a good one. Like I've said over and over in this review, it just feels better to play than PD2, and I do think is worth consideration even in its current state - though do try to buy it on sale if you can :)",1760232136,9505.0,True,False,False,13,3,0.6247442960739135

This game is boring, repetitive, lacking in content, flawed (online-only), and not improving at all aside from bugfixes & UI changes (it's been 2 years).
The only compliments I can give this game are: Gustavo Coutinho's music is great, Jacket's Sociopath overskill weapon is fun, faces & hair don't look as scuffed compared to Payday 2, and the new Wolf VA is good. That's it.
I had hope for this game, I wanted to give them a chance and fix & improve the game, ""give them time"" like some people will tell you, but it has been 2 goddamn years and nothing has improved, in fact it just gets worse and worse, especially after their recent announcement about cancelling offline mode.

This game is basically a worse, subjectively ""prettier"" Payday 2 with less content, boring objectives, and some additional gimmicks. 
Not to mention most of the new content in this game is already locked behind DLCs, and it was already this way during Year 1 which is pretty bad for a game with so many issues they should be focusing on instead of releasing fucking DLCs.

Gone are the days of vetting newbies before the mission, guiding them through the mechanics. Now everyone is thrown in blindly, over and over again, without a real chance to learn. It took me over 15 hours in the game to understand how to navigate some of the more complex missions.

However, besides that, the game is genuinely fun to play. Admittedly, the enemies are a little spongy regarding body shots, but otherwise the combat feels very good. Moving around feels buttery smooth, with vaulting and climbing through windows stream-lined.

The cop animations are vastly inferior than Payday 2. In that game, cops reacted in a multitude of ways depending of the angles they're shot from. They would occasionally trip and fall, spending time to regain their footing. If shot on the back, they would throw their arms in surprise and fall forward. They even have an unique animation if you shot them in the balls. That energy is sorely missing in Payday 3. They brush off bullets as if they were airsoft pallets. They don't even throw themselves on the floor anymore to escape line of fire, they just occasionally sidestep and ragdoll on death.

Here's the short of it

[h1] PROS [/h1] 
-Gunplay that's SO GOOD I don't know if I'll be able to return to PD2's weapons

-Beautiful animations for guns, characters, and the new contextual ones for objectives

-Interesting setting with a large focus on technology and digital age gadgets/heists

-Cool new cops with updated designs and mechanics

-New ""phases"" for missions that'll make gameplay more progressive instead of stagnant for the entire level.

Yup, that's all the good.
Ok here's the thing you're here for

[h1] CONS [/h1] 
-The worst UI I've probably seen from any shooter let alone any game I've played
Like for real THE GUNS AREN'T EVEN SEPARATED BY WEAPON TYPE! SECONDARIES ARE ALSO IN THE SAME SLOT AS PRIMARIES! HOW, HOW DO YOU F​U​C​K​I​N​G DO THIS??

-While the heists are mostly... ok. They don't have multi-day heists, escape heists, no bosses or unique enemies for the level. Most maps aren't randomized like in PD2. Unless you wanna count placement of keycards and minor stuff like that. Also cook-off isn't an infinite heist which blows p​e​n​i​s.

-I'm sure everyone's aware but I'll still put it here anyway. The skill system is dog s​h​i​t and revolves around 3 different modifiers. That being EDGE, GRIT, and RUSH. The idea of these 3 BEING in skills aren't the problem. It's just that the entire skill tree FOCUSES on these solely with like 5 individual skills actually giving you a unique mechanic. Just like the UI, it's super confusing.

-This game, while better than beta, is buggy as f​u​c​k. I promise you I am not suffering from mental r​e​t​a​r​d​a​t​i​o​n when I say I had a moment playing cook-off when the intercom bitch told me to put in a chemical and I even waited for her to confirm it, yknow? Like wait for that second line that comes after it to make sure she didn't mess up the ingredients. I put it in AND THE F​UC​K​I​N​G LAB BLEW UP AFTER ONLY 5 BAGS. 

-The team behind it wants to upgrade to Unreal Engine 5, but why? The engine they got now works just fine. Plus WHO WANTS THIS? I've heard literally NOBODY say anything positive about UE5. How about you actually add content?

-Guns are level-up progression now like in COD. It's ok... but I would rather just build my guns than grind for attachments. This locks players out of opportunities in heists because they hafta use a s​h​i​t weapon for 10 hours to unlock something that would make the weapon actually viable.

                                                                   [LAST BUT NOT LEAST]
Content. Why would I ever play PayDay 3 instead of PayDay 2? it suffers from a lack of Heists, weapons, customization, heisters, mechanics, etc etc etc. To be fair this isn't JUST a PayDay 3 issue, but it's still a valid criticism.

The game STILL isn't worth your money. does not matter what amount. its the worse version of a product you can have infinitely more fun with (and no, im not talking about the one with a subscription service added onto it.)

There are currently 16 heists in the game. This sounds good doesnt it, considering the standard the previous 2 games have set, right? Well, no, actually. There is little, if not ZERO randomisation in this game. No changes in objectives, no randomized events that could change the way you play a heist. Nothing. The very first game, PAYDAY: The Heist did this, and I've had way more fun with it than this zygote of a game.

Now lack of variety shouldn't really matter if the gameplay loop is fun, right? Wrong again! The game has tried to appeal to fans of both PAYDAY: The Heist and PAYDAY 2 by introducing a mixture of both the boots-on-the-ground gameplay where it feels like you're a nobody going up against the world, and the power fantasy of the second where it feels like youre a one man army. it fails on both of these fronts. Half of the reason why PAYDAY 2's power fantasy gameplay worked was because of build variety-- it never mattered how many cops you were slaughtering, but because you made something that could kill thousands of cops at a time.

And now they have told us that there will be no online mode whatsoever. You are buying Milk: the video game.

Buy PAYDAY The Heist and Postal 2 instead. you'll get infinitely more hours from those games.

1272080,False,"Sadly, I can’t recommend this game anymore.

I wanted to like Payday 3 As someone who’s spent a decent amount playing Payday 2 I was hopeful it will be identical with better graphics and continuation of the story. But this game is a massive letdown, and now with the cancellation of offline mode, I’m done. So here’s my honest review:

Cons:
- As of this review, they’ve announced that offline mode is cancelled.
- Base game just feels trashy, running to objectives feels awkward, and combat just doesn't feel satisfying. It doesn’t feel satisfying to do anything.
- The music is bad, unenjoyable, just background noise you’ll forget exists five minutes later (i had to download a jukebox mod with the payday 2 music just to have a better time).
- The objectives are boring and not fun. You're telling me I have to stand in a circle to ""catch Wi-Fi""? XD
- The Edge Rush system is garbage. They mentioned a ""Skill Points 2.0"" update, but haven’t given a date, so who knows if or when that’s actually coming.
- The voice lines for the character ""Shade"" sound cheap and robotic, almost like they were generated by text-to-speech, There's no personality, no intensity — just lifeless lines that take you out of the moment.
- The special cops are just bullet sponges with zero personality, not challenging at all, and in general, Taking out cops in Payday 2 felt impactful, in Payday 3 it just isn't...
- The new CEO, Adolf Kristjansson, previously worked at EA so you already know where this is going.
- Microtransactions

Pros:
- If you just pretend the Payday franchise doesn’t exist, or any heist game in that matter, like if this was the first ever heist game you might think it’s alright.
-Stealth is fun (except for the circle objectives).
- The graphics look good

Final Thoughts:
The game is a complete mess. they’ve officially scrapped offline play,  That means when the servers go down and trust me, they will, the game will become completely unplayable. It's 2025 and we're still pretending always online is acceptable for a PvE co-op game? The only reason its online is because of the microtransactions.
Trust me, this isn’t going to be like No Man’s Sky redemption arc.
If you haven’t bought Payday 3 yet: don’t. If you already did, i hope you didn’t pay full price. And if you’re still holding on for a comeback... I respect your hope, but I wouldn’t count on it.
All i can say is IT'S OVER. Its MY FAULT for having hopes for this game, i doubt i will change my review for this game unless most of the cons will be fixed.

1272080,False,"This game is so bad. I really wanted to give it a chance, but it’s just terrible I don’t even feel excited to play it.

I waited for them to fix the game, maybe add map adjustments or a pre-planning system or something like that… but no. Instead, you have to complete another map just to unlock assets. Like, how dumb is that? I’ve got money and I want to spend it but nope.

Then there’s the dumb skill system, which I don’t even ****ing understand. You need to keep playing just to unlock another skill tree even though you already have skill points to spend. OMG, how does that make any sense? It’s just bad design.

There also aren’t many maps. Payday 2 had 11 maps at launch, and some even had Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 variations. I loved doing Framing Frame with my friends in Payday 2 — I don’t even know how many times we finished it. But in Payday 3? I haven’t finished a single map in stealth because it’s so boring and unnecessarily hard. Like, you’re trying to rob a penthouse, and the map is tiny, yet there are a ton of security guards and cameras everywhere. It’s just frustrating instead of fun.

They even said they wouldn’t release Payday 2 maps — and then immediately broke that promise. Why? Because payday 3 maps are so boring.

And when you finish all the objectives, the game throws an endless assault at you that you can’t do anything about. It never stops. There are always cops shooting at you while you’re trying to get the bags to the van. It’s beyond frustrating.

There isn’t even a good story. In Payday 2, saving Hoxton actually felt cool. But here? You save Houston. Wow. What an original idea.

And even then, I still remember how amazing those Hoxton moments were in Payday 2. We were genuinely excited there were small things like Hoxton singing a Christmas song, little conversations about him and that big Dentist reveal. Those moments were awesome. Hoxton Breakout was such a hype event too.

If you’re going to copy and paste something, at least do it properly. You have great voice actors, but you don’t even use them well. Back then, they would release short story films and we’d watch them over and over again. Now? They don’t even bother doing that.

1272080,True,"I don't think it's a bad game by any means; it's fun and the combat has a satisfying punch to it. The graphics, 3D models, textures, and optimization are overall pretty good, especially when compared to its dated predecessor. The gameplay and mission design feel well-rounded and more polished.

However, it definitely falls short when compared to the plethora of content that PAYDAY 2 offers. PAYDAY 3 should have more content (heists, weapons, cosmetics, enemy types, etc.) to play with, as well as much more long-term progression to keep the player interested. It's good that they are taking steps such as adding the Skill Tree to help alleviate this lack of progression, but more steps need to be taken to even be on par with the amount of PAYDAY 2's content.

That said, I don't think it's the right idea to be adding paywalled DLCs at this point in time. It's simply too early; there should be more free heists and free weapons offered to the player before locking new items behind a cost, especially since the game is paid access to begin with. I understand that revenue is crucial, but it would be a shame if lack of funding is what's withholding the success of this game.

1272080,True,"I also thought this game was bad. At the beggining I really thought it was a downgrade from the second one, but it honestly isn't. Now, this doesn't mean there's nothing bad about the game, obviously, but it's not as bad as some people say. 
I must admit, I was extremely wrong about the game. Let's go with my overall opinion on everything.
Let's start with the heists, which I believe to be it's weakest point. They are, boring. And this is a big issue, because the whole point of the game is playing the heists. I believe they are pretty basic and uninteresting and they lack replayability. I liked payday 1 and 2 heists more. Payday 2 also had bad heists but they were overall pretty solid. I'd really like to see The Bomb: Forest in this game, it was one of my favorites in payday 2, the layout of the map and the design is amazing. What I mean is, in payday 2 you'd steal interesting things (some times) but here you never do that. The most ""Interesting"" thing you steal is a crypto wallet... if we can call that interesting. 
Skills, aren't that bad. I honestly really enjoy the Rush, Grit and Edge system. I don't think it's that bad, I think it needs some upgrades, but that's never going to happen because they announced skills 2.0 recently and the E, G and R system is going down the drain. 
Gameplay wise, I really like it. I think that the shootouts are much more fun than payday 2. I believe it to be an upgrade of PDTH. This game, seems like an upgraded version (mostly, not heists´ wise for example) of the first game.
Enemies are pretty solid. I like them much more than in payday 2. Cloakers are kind of scary tbh, tasers are much more efficient here, and don't make you waste all your mag when they tase you; Bulldozers are tankier and more lethal. Snipers I believe to be well balanced. I've heard some people complain about how much they take to shoot at you, but you have to think about how much it takes for your plates to regen (If you have them equipped) and how much damage the sniper does to your armor. If you have no armor regen then one sniper only can make you use an armor box. Then there's this 2 new specials called the Nader, who throws gas grenades; and the Techy, who makes drones appear while they are alive. 
I also really like the weapons. What I don't like are the modifications, as they don't really seem to make much difference. You notice your weapons being stronger due to what skills you have equipped and not your weapon mods. 
Stealth is another big topic. I think it's a really big improbement from the second game. What I dislike is that you need almost all the good stealth perks to be able to complete even one mission. In payday 2 you were able to complete a stealth mission as your 5-10th mission, here it's impossible. You need to grind assault until you have enough skill points. I really dislike that, but the stealth itself is really good. 
Overall, I think it's a pretty solid game. Flawed, but not as much as people make it seem. It's quite enjoyable.",1759202791,2886.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5224719047546386

1272080,True,"The game has much better gunplay than payday 2, and that's its strongest point. Everything doesn't seem overly powered like in payday 2 and it's more grounded.

I prefer payday 2's stealth mechanics though. It is absurd to be able to be caught in a private guard an infinite amount of times in a private area when stealthing a mission, I even sometimes intentionally get caught so I can steal the guard's keycard when he looks away (have i ever seen a female guard or cop in this game??). The old ECM jammers also are more fun and balance out the difficulty, as payday 3 lets you complete some stealth heists without needing to ever mask up. You can lockpick and perform other illegal actions while unmasked, which could be used for some interesting things but makes things easier.

The biggest weakness is probably that objectives seem repetitive, wandering the map to find cell phones people left behind and standing in circles.

I would feel otherwise if there was a true competitor in this genre, but there isn't. It's really just payday 3 against payday 2. I wouldn't play a thousand hours in this game and it seems worth it on sale just to play the included heists or maybe some of the previous year's heists when they are heavily discounted. The game is arguably not better than payday 2 in any specific way, other than being on a newer game engine.

Payday 2 even has some features payday 3 still doesn't have like the ability to play offline. Why do I have to find a match when I'm just playing with one other friend in a private game?

I think they have.

My playtime on this game is 59 minutes. 29 minutes of that was spent trying to get signed upto their bloody dodgy account setup rubbish. It takes me less time to watch paint dry, which is a similar experience to what i had with PD3's gameplay.

1272080,False,"Let's just forget the failed start and discuss this game as it is for a moment. 
Graphics:
Ok-ish. It is pleasant for the eye, but there is something generic that you can see in other Unreal Engine 4 games. I would say there is almost nothing that can help distinguish it from the other games. 
Animations:
The same as the graphics. Even sometimes you feel the lack in movements, which does not correspond to the game's pace honestly.
Gameplay:
Fun at the start, but you get used to it pretty fast unfortunately. Perks are nice, guns have differences between each other and you can feel impact of each of them, but there is something in level design, which interrupts replayability. 
Music:
Nice, but 2 things: 1) No song were stuck in my head. 
2) The ""quiet"" part of the songs are just dull.
Voice acting:
Overacting. Doesn't fit the game's atmosphere. 
Content:
Not a lot, but can entertain for some time.
Overall?
It is fun at the start, but after 20 hours of gameplay it becomes boring. Nice to try, but for their price I don't recommend.

Now let's compare with it predecessor Payday 2. 
Payday 2 graphics were weird, but honestly unique. Where else you saw a shooter made with racing game's engine, lol. In contrast with 2nd part, graphics of 3rd is dull with no particular parts. 
Animations feel the same as in 2nd part. That's just weird.
The biggest reason why I have 20 times more hours in P2 than P3 is gameplay. P2 heists has random factor, which changes level every restart making for players unique playthroughs and challenges you a little if you fail. 3rd part has random features, but they are reset when you rehost the lobby, making playthrough easier but WAY less raplayable. Yes, they also added nice new perks and you don't have 1000000 weapons with 3 of them being the main meta, but they could just redo it in the predecessor.
Music is one of the saddest part. I still have Simon Vuklind's songs in my playlist together with Coutihno and I still listen their tracks. But P3 music... Damn, that's straight regress. Almost non existent quiet heist part and with no specific features loud part. 
Voice acting disappoints too. Previous part was a little mad and out of bounds, that's why overacting of the cast was in place. But the current game is more realistic and overacting just does not fit into the game.
Amount of content now and the speed that we got delivered with is astronomically smaller than in P2. It's simple as that.
Don't forget the devs' poor choices:
The game came raw and unprepaired. Devs cut game's financing and it is just factually inferior to Payday 2.
Final thought:
If they wanted to release the game so hard, they should have made a new game not connected to Payday series or at least not calling it Payday. But I think the best solution is either add new game mechanics and redo most of the game's boring parts so it feels new and fresh or delete this game and make a Payday 2 remake with new features, which will set a new view on the game. 
Verdict:
Don't buy. Even on sale. Devs went too far with their bad decisions and they need to understand that they need to actually listen to their community and not milk the heck out of them. If you didn't try Payday 2, try it instead of the 3. It's still more way entertaining.",1759063088,2273.0,True,False,False,8,0,0.5478035807609558

Seeing how the dev's have started reworking the game & more content is getting released, it's getting closer to the roots of payday 2 which is what the game needed. Having more heist & weapon variety has helped which looking forward I personally hope to see more of. As other people have already stated, it's in a much better playable state since launch. Being able to play each map how I want to and when I want to is nice compared to how it was in sequence. Seeing the QoL changes to the game has been a breath of fresh air & overall made it a better playable experience.

It would be awesome to see a free legacy pack added in for player incentive, rework [b] but [/b] keep the layout of some old maps like shadow raid & go bank, throw a few of the old weapons in there too.

Gone is the uniquity, gone is the passion and creativity, and - what pains me the most to admit - gone is this franchise’s soul. 

I can’t quite explain what happened. Has Payday changed? Have I changed? Almost a decade ago, the heisting and the grinding were fun. Today, there is no more fun to be found. Technically speaking, Payday 3 is a revolution compared to its predecessor. So how come I’m left so melancholic? Somewhere along the way they lost their passion and the fun went with it. 

The weapons on offer are a paltry choice of generic gun-metal bricks, lacking the creativity or even variety of what came before. The music vainly grasps at the nostalgic energy of old without quite reaching those same heights. The heists - though updated to respectable modern visual standards - just don’t feel the same. Mechanically they have evolved nowhere. In an empty attempt to bring back the lost magic, Starbreeze have drip fed some remastered locations, but they only serve as a tacit admittance of their current lack of imagination. 

Most damning of all however are the menus; a generic minimalist style taken straight from a default Unreal tutorial. Gone is the brilliantly integrated and creative in-universe Crime net. In its stead they replaced it with the most generic menu styling a UI artist could think up. Hell what shipped with Payday 3 is what an AI would have designed menus as; derivative, bland, and about as far away from “passionate” as a creative endeavor could be.

1272080,False,"Payday 3 is a decent game, that simply needs time and a company that actually cares about it's player base, community and the game itself. Payday 2 received a shit ton of content over its life span and I don't see Payday 3 being any different, especially considering the direction the company appears to be moving in. With a new skill system on the way and a new DLC heist having just been released, it's evident Starbreeze still cares about Payday 3. However, as it stands Payday 3 is simply just not a good game. Here's a few of my biggest gripes with the game as a whole

1. Team AI in this game is braindead. Inaccurate, poor choice of targets and an inability to stay behind cover causing them to die more than any player ever could. Which, in turn, makes playing heists solo on OVK (the games hardest difficulty at the time of writing) an absolute pain in the ass and nearly impossible. I have ~500 hours in payday 2, not as many as a vast majority of the community but enough to beat heists on One Down by myself, I am not kidding when I say OVK on Payday 3 is more difficult than One Down on PD2. This game is built to be a co-op experience and entirely forces you to either play with friends or play on a lower difficulty which is simply not as rewarding

2. Weapon XP Upgrading system. Terrible. Its bad. The amount of weapon XP you gain per heist isn't enough to upgrade weapons fast enough, not to mention the absurd weapon level requirements for certain attachments. Some guns require you to obtain a weapon level of 28 before unlocking the final attachment. It's not rewarding enough, nor fun enough to warrant 28 entire levels of slow grinding just to obtain good attachments for guns. 

3. Speaking of guns, all of the best in class gun options are locked behind paywalls. Granted, cheap paywalls, but paywalls none the less. You want to use one of the most iconic handguns (Deagle) in gaming ever? Locked behind a paywall. You wanna use the spas 12? One of the most notorious shotguns ever seen in any video game? Paywall. I understand making some of the better guns in the game DLC, it makes sense, companies and their money and all. But locking all of the best in class options behind DLC is just garbage and makes a lot of your player base hate you

4. The objectives are repetitive and seen in almost every heist. Copy > Paste from heist to heist. Do you enjoy standing in 4 different circles for 20 seconds at a time? Do you enjoy finding 4 different switch boxes and flipping colored switches just to progress the heist? Well this game might be the one for you


As a whole, Payday 3's gunplay is better than Payday 2's, the graphics are obviously better but that doesn't excuse the game still being run on Diesel Engine. However, every thing else about this game from the paywalls, to the braindead AI, to the repetition, to the broke dick piece of shit weapon XP system that for some reason is still in the game 2 years later, it's just worse. Not to mention the few amount of heists that you have if you aren't willing to spend more money, 8 total I believe. I wouldn't recommend this game to really anyone that is looking for a good successor to Payday 2, it feels more like a sequel to Payday: The Heist than anything. Overall, don't buy this game right now. Wait a few more years, then come back",1758577659,3312.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5070422291755676

What really worked in Payday 1—and most of Payday 2—were the HEISTS, especially in PD1. Each one had a twist that made it stand out. Heat Street is a perfect example: instead of the usual setup where you pick stealth or loud, it throws you straight into the aftermath of a job gone wrong. Matt, a former associate, betrays the crew and escapes, setting everything in motion.

At first, the goal is simple—meet up with the getaway driver. BUT THEN the driver gets shot down and crashes, forcing you to continue on foot and chase Matt. Luckily, his van also crashes, but he refuses to leave. YOU HAVE TO BURN THE VAN to flush him out, and when he finally does, it’s STILL not over—you can’t just take the briefcase, because THE MONEY IS HANDCUFFED TO HIM. So now you’re forced to drag Matt along while he’s injured, shouting at him to keep moving through waves of cops until you finally reach the helicopter getaway.

THEY CHANGED THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEIST 2 TIMES. That’s what made it feel so BADASS and IMMERSIVE—it showed that things aren’t always going to go your way. DIAMOND HEIST PROVES THIS TOO, because the code you’re given ISN’T GUARANTEED TO WORK, forcing you to go loud. The heists were unpredictable when you first played them and made you want to play it again because you wondered what would’ve happened if you did X instead of Z.

In Payday 3, all you do is scan a few QR codes, stand in circles, type in a keypad with ZERO punishment for failure, access a room, grab a couple bags of loot, and leave. And that’s it… THE END.

My totally honest opinion - I think it's playable. The game should be released in the state it is in now.

However, after 2 years I really enjoyed the game, and this is coming from a person that was very disappointed after getting the most expensive pre order. I still am sad that I bought it, because I feel like this many heists, weapons etc. should be in the release version of the game, and not after 2 years, but it's better than nothing, right? 

I spent over 2000 hours in PD2, and I must tell you, this game is more like Payday The Heist, than Payday 2.

To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. Starbreeze had the chance to deliver one of the greatest sequels ever, but fell short in almost every way. Day 1 was a mess — constant issues, online only restrictions, and unstable servers. The map selection was tiny and mechanics were janky. Now in 2025, little has changed. Instead of meaningful content, we’ve seen pathetic DLCs dropping and almost no substantial updates.

Payday 3 feels less like a sequel and more like a downgrade. Unless something drastic changes, I don’t see Starbreeze recovering from this monumental failure.",1758380790,573.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5259696245193481

The Pro's

- Great graphics
- Overkill system
- Jacket character + overkill weapon (greatest dlc so far, and will probably remain that way for a long time)
- Hostage system
- Easier than PD2 (but whether that is a pro or a con is up to you)

The Cons

- Some of the maps are.. boring. The very first heist on the top of a list is a small bank that makes you feel like you're robbing an office job rather than an actual bank
- Pretty much 0 RNG aspects
- they removed the day system from PD2 :(
- Newer maps are paid DLC. That's cool and I get this game needs support right now but man.. the prices on these are not that great for a heist that is replayable maybe twice (loud and stealth)
- feels like it leans way too much into ''future tech'' to solve problems in the security of places, which is annoying because it feels stale and kind of dumb. why am i supposed to stand in a VERY SPECIFIC part of a room in 5 different areas to unlock the ability to open a wooden door??? what??? and why do i need to look around for random phones and scan QR codes to open doors?? i just dont get it man
- no real reason to use different guns for different heists
- no reason to spend money on things
- lackluster enemies. you're always going to fight the same modeled security guards, with the same types of enemies. no, a drone does not make for an exciting new enemy type. neither does a random female agent that places a random ''camo'' wall on the floor and camps there. i dont think ive ever had any issues with her during the time that i was playing. at this point you might as well throw a powerless superhero like batman in the game as a ''major boss'' to scare players into retreating if a heist goes on for a little too long. please just add new enemy types that are fun to fight instead of the same 2 stunners and juggernaut characters
- you cant really customize your own character that much. clothing are just reskins, gloves are kinda lame and you dont even get to see your own mask that much. you also for some reason cant customize your own AI which is confusing to me?? it'd feel a lot nicer if i could give my AI specific things to help survivability more

despite the fact that there are so many cons.. i still do recommend this game to people who might want to try out something advanced. its not a bad experience, just one that doesnt change up PD2's mechanics enough for it to feel fresh. i think all that payday3 needs right now is new and fresh things, like new enemy types, more objectives and fun maps. i wouldnt mind stealing cocaine from some random gang down the alley again.

[h1]looks like the ""dead game"" meme backfired on the sequel :( [/h1]

TL;DR:
unfortunately, this game proves that PAYDAY 2's success has never been understood by it's developers.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3562255348

L;DR:

The game is just.. souless? The old characters shouldn't have appeared again in the first place, they should retire, I don't understand why we again play as an aged man who learns how to pick a lock faster, carry more than 1 bag, shoot & reload more efficiently after having stolen billions of dollars, diamonds, KGs of cocaine, gold, [strike]goats[/strike] and killing thousands of swat units. The game feels like a failed attempt to make a mixture of PD1's gameplay where you actually felt the guns and your character's weights and some unconscious analysis result of what made PD2 so great. In this case, bags and stealth (?). Now it feels like neither hardcore skill-oriented coop (PD1) nor like a super-fun, extremely customizable, almost infinitely replayable, deep, enjoyable and UNIQUE phenomenon known as PD2. It's heartbreaking to see PD2 as a masterpiece and the only game in it's genre, even being not entirely perfect, it's still perfect enough to have ~20k concurrent players vs. PD3's ~500. There was and still is no other heist game, thought there were attempts, which could repeat PD2's success, style, class and the amount of fun. In PD2 you could feel the influence of / see direct references to ""The Heat"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", Hotline Miami, Pulp Fiction, and whatever else I didn't know about, but those are already action-driven, bright, energetic cult classics - a perfect fit to payday2's feel, look and sound. It was about money, risk, greed, cards, XP, offshore, contracts, skill, knowledge, drive, two-piece suits (yes, less at the end I know). Man, the style and the vibe was amazing and complemented by colors, music, gameplay pace, both in stealth and in loud. 

In PD3 I only feel the influence of user agreement, telemetry, unreal engine (jesus, can we stop with this abomination?), press [V] to slide, and whatever checkboxes are there in the udemy game design course, it feels like a dry product not a game.

- it's an UE game, which means it will feel like one: you are a behemoth with weighted vest and a paintball gun, unless you are really comfortable with the engine as a dev and make it feel the way which fits the game;s soul. Look at your teammate's running animations, just to estimate the amount of effort put in it.

- talking of UE, UI looks like it was bought for 50$ straight from UE5 marketplace - ""FPS Shooter modern flat UI"", and Im not only talking about the usability of the main menu, the one in-game feels generic. just have a look how much uniqueness and personality PD2 UI has, show me at least one game which has something similar. I'm talking about vanilla HUD, not the custom ones which make ur game look like a fighter jet cockpit. Look, I know you get limited to the UE and who cares if the game is fun right? Right, but the game is not fun, and the amount of such small details stack up, so that you run out of energy and reasons to justify and to try to understand their game design decisions, because either they weren't conscious or they were influenced by some trends or someone who shouldn't have opened their mouth. Now as a result we have a boring, odd game without a story, style or addictive gameplay only few people can digest and play on a regular basis.

Again, PD2 was a phenomenon, like other games which don't really have a real competition because they are SO unique in their interface, style, sound design, characters, feel and fun factor. It was as unique as DBD (fcked up over time though, too), Killing Floor 1/mod (not 2 , and god, even less the 3rd - look at that fail, was easy to predict starting with KF2, too, since the devs sold out and ignored EVERYTHING what KF was about). PD3, unfortunately, met the same fate.

-------

- the devs claimed, you'd actually appreciate when someone joins your game. just like with many other games nowadays that have ""co-op"" tag, it usually means ""multiplayer"", run along with people who either forgot there is a solo mode or who just use online to feel less lonely. Co-op is an option. If you make such a claim, you can't be serious in relying on a modern player to play co-op in it's pure sense. Give them at least a more advanced ping options a comms wheel, which features more than ""Shit!"", ""Fuсk!"" and middle finger, then I will believe you meant what you said. Oh, and give rewards (*sigh*) for co-op actions - maybe that'd help. Talking about public lobbies here, of course.

-------

- the devs claimed, that one of the reasons for mandatory online feature was to fight the cheating problem PD2 had. guess what, you could always send a post request using some know web proxy debugger and give yourself whatever you wanted, all that just a few clicks away. they DIDN'T implement user input validation, you can intercept, manipulate and post any nonsensical number you want on their servers, - does that sound like fighting cheating? this was already possible when pd3 could only be played online.

let's be honest about those two, they didn't really care, but the claims were made.


- music is not even close to be that memorable, have you heard ""ode to greed"" when you're playing big bank with it's melody, tempo, accents and progression? ok, now search a big bank heist from pd3, and hear / see yourself how spectacular the heist in PD2 was and how much fun it is to stay in circles in PD3 for a certain amount of time. Remember the tension of Gun Metal Grey OST from the First World Bank (PD1 was even better there), the ""Backstab"" chords on Hoxton Revenge loud, or ""And now we run"" + alarm sounds when you screwed up your very first Shadow Raid? "" Kicking Ass and Taking Names"" on the car heist? ""Donacdum"" on Overdrill? Those godly bridges when the assault / anticipation phase starts and ""You have been kicked from the game.""  No? Come on, tell me PD3 is ANYTHING close to that. I'd say they didn't care about matching the soundtrack with the game but.. there is really nothing to match it with. Even if you replaced the PD3 OST with PD2's one, it will feel off.

-------

every update feels like a step in a wrong direction or extremely insignificant.

As its at this time, i still cant recommend it whole heartedly.

MY REASONING -------------------------------------------------------------

Log in requirement's............................................................................................................................
if a customer has bought a game for entertainment purposes (as literally everyone does) it is a hindrance if your making them have to create more accounts to play.
Its one of the reasons why people wanted single player or Solo play so we would not need constant server connection.
Making an account if perfectly fine if its only with the objective to play online Multiplayer. But dont agree with needing it for solo play, it gives the idea that the devs/producers dont have the players 100% at heart.

UI Navigation for the Loadout and purchases...........................................................................................................
The in game store layout is a complete mess. 
Navigating through the UI is difficult mostly due a few things, (things i believe should be really easy to fix for the devs). 
Scrolling up and down is clunky and needs to be a smooth motion / when the mouse hovers over an item that is only just out view the whole selection list will jump making what ever your mouse was on come into view / NON of the weapons are categorized so if your looking for a pistol you'll have to look for it scattered among EVERYTHING ELSE / When i want to get a Weapon it does not do well separating the cosmetics and items.

Weapon Customization and leveling............................................................................................................. 
This is something im REALLY disappointed in, weapons are locked behind levels ... ok that makes some sense you work your way up to unlock new things right? So why is it do i have to then use the weapon to LEVEL THE WEAPON ITS SELF UP TO ADD ANYTHING TO IT!!! No freedom to customize or change attachments (which is are sevearly lacking in different options by the way), which are all blocked off by a leveling system which is slow and tedious, almost to the point WHERE I ACTUALLY WISH I COULD JUST PAY FOR THE FUCKING FULL UPGRADE but i cant even do that!!
Alot of players tend to take pride in the weapons they created (ESPECIALLY IN PAYDAY-2!!) were creativity with the primary item used in the game is changed to be entertaining.
I really had so much fun customizing my weapons in payday 2 so that i had ALOT of damage but ZERO accuracy making every shot a complete gamble on if its a big win or if i get shot.... which kind of leeds me to to my next point.
Weapon Customization (as limited as it is) MAKES NO CHANGES TO YOUR WEAPONS STATS!
Say for example you played for hours and hours slooging though heist after heist, and finally fully level your weapon... The stats for that weapon have VERY little change or wiggle room on what you can do with it.
The level 2 barrel extention and the level 17 barrel extention make the same amount of change to the stats of the weapon... Rendering all that time and effort pretty much meaningless (outside of the idea that maybe it looks nicer.)
 _______________________________________________________________________

 
Its not all bad tho, the things i do really like is the Combat / Visuals + effects / Map and Heist ideas (Tho the Story is kinda mid).
And i do REALLY want to see this game get better by giving more fun and creative choice's for the player to tinker with. 
The game desperately needs to take its self less seriously.

Ill probably keep playing here and there but what i was talking about before (the creativity with the weapons and play-style) was the very reason why i sunk over 700 Hours into the previous game.
But this game as it stands now... the game is just lacking in player creativity and choice.
 
Until this game can change that i cant recommend it.

The buff to enemy AI seems good, giving players much more challenge in higher difficulties, Armor 2.0 adds much more build depth/variety, so overall its not bad right now although far from perfect. I do however have some small problems like the reduced ammo pickup, i feel like it can be harsh on some weapons especially the weaker ones like SMGs on Overkill difficulty, they chew through ammo and get 4 bullets back per box. Ammo bags does, of course fix this but still, with Crew AI sometimes putting ammo bags out in the open, its not always easy trying to get back ammo, especially if you use an entire clip just to break dozer visors/kill a dozer. But again, overall, I like where the game is right now.

1272080,True,"I think it’s best to divide Payday 3 into two separate parts, each getting reviewed individually.

[h1]1. Part – The Menu[/h1]
Even before you play your first heist, you are hit with a user agreement that you have to sign off on so you can play.

Signing it and finally seeing the entire menu, I was quite confused. Hitting the big play button, the game doesn’t really bother letting you know that there is a tutorial. Sure, it’s there, it can be noticed, but I didn’t, and I think the game is to blame for that. This design carries on throughout the entire menu. The game doesn’t bother explaining the new armor mechanic, nor does it show how the skill system works.

The menu, and in general the tutorial, is lacking. Starbreeze is currently trying to make the new player experience better and they are making good steps with smash and grab heists, but they have to show everything more crearly to the player.

Let’s say 4.5/10 → it’s not a complete mess, and once you know how to navigate it, it’s fine, but the game should explain/unlock more as you progress.

[h1]Part 2 – The In-Heist Experience[/h1]
Unlike the menu, the in-heist experience is generally great. The gunplay is fun, armor works (once you figure out how it works), overkill weapons are a great addition, and if you play all heists in loud + stealth on overkill difficulty, you can get at least an hour (I believe even 2–3) from each heist.

[h2]LOUD[/h2]
[b]The flaws.[/b] Cops are currently quite weak, but if you don’t min-max your setup, I think you are going to struggle on overkill. Guns in Payday 3 feel great, but sadly, the game doesn’t allow you to modify your weapon immediately, because you first have to level them up. This works for overkill weapons, because there are only 5 of them (1 being for stealth), so you don’t really change them that often. But for normal weapons, at least for me, it was in a way oppressive, and I couldn’t just pick up the weapon I wanted to play. I believe that leveling up categories instead of weapons would flow much more naturally with the game and wouldn’t prevent you from playing your favorite weapons. The game also doesn’t really tell you when you are on your last down, which can be quite frustrating. Lastly, the crew AI is sometimes quite janky and sometimes stuggles with helping you up, and it also happens that you get downed, then all of them get downed, and you lose the mission immediately.

[b] The positives.[/b]  The gunplay is really, really fun and feels great. Each heist also felt quite unique and tried to bring something new to the game. Objectives can sometimes be quite annoying, but for the most part, they are unique and the game feels fresh. Also, each map is nicely paired with new movement mechanics, and they generally look great. The hostage trading is a great idea, and it works.

Let’s say 8/10 → I know I sounded quite negative, but I truly enjoy myself on each and every heist. The gunplay and general smoothness of the game outweigh the negatives by quite a big margin, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any negatives.

[h2]STEALTH[/h2]
[b] The flaws.[/b]  The casing mechanic is a great idea, and in general I like it, but maybe the game could be harsher on you when you get caught. In general, it will lead to a boring walk with a guard and nothing else, so maybe letting you get caught twice and then arresting you would feel more fair.

[b]The positives.[/b]  Honestly, if Payday 3 has done something right, it’s this. The stealth is quite arcadey, but it can still be challenging. You have to learn the layout of the map, the patrol routes, and where the objectives can be located. Also, difficulty is now much more balanced and finally changes the heist in a way that is fun. Quite a few heists can also be finished entirely or mostly in casing mode or masked mode, so they can give you two quite unique experiences.

Let’s say 9/10 → stealth truly feels great, and if you liked stealth in Payday 2, you are going to be treated.

[h2]Final Thoughts on Heists[/h2]
Heists are fun, and I enjoyed myself on every last one of them. The DLC heists are also great, and I can definitely recommend buying the Year One edition.

Payday 3 doesn’t have as many heists as Payday 2 had, but I also think it’s kind of unfair to compare them. Currently, the game has 17 heists – 5 of them being DLC, 12 in the base game, but soon it will be 13. Sure, that’s not a lot, but if you play each heist in stealth and loud on overkill, it’s going to take quite a few hours to finish them all. Add to it achievements, and you can play the game for more than 100 hours. But if you min-max your points and play the best weapons, then yes, the game is going to feel quite short.

I would say that the randomness of the heists is on par with older Payday 2 heists (Vlad’s or Hector’s story missions, Bain’s first missions, etc.), so not great, but it can still change your gameplay a little.

[h2]Thoughts That Didn’t Fit Anywhere[/h2]
The game still lacks a fully offline mode. It wasn’t an issue for me, but you should know about that.
The favor system is quite boring, and they should add preplanning back.
The C-stacks feel quite underused; maybe they could be a solution to the weapon upgrade problem outlined in the heists → loud → flaws.
I think the devs should be communicating more with the community and talking about what they are doing.
Outfits feel great, and although there isn’t as much variety as in Payday 2, I think it’s more intuitive and I found it more fun.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I think the game deserves around 7 or 8/10. It’s not perfect, and I hope they are going to fix certain errors that I outlined here, but the most important aspects work, and it’s a good game at the very least.",1754870300,5390.0,True,False,False,2,1,0.5

1272080,True,"When the game was first announced, I had kind of hoped that it would be almost nothing like its predecessor in terms of the ""Loud"" gameplay. Payday has been dubbed a ""horde shooter"", because cops act like zombie hordes with guns. Payday would be a much more enjoyable experience if it took notes from tactical shooters, instead. I feel like it wouldn't really be that hard to convert the game into a good tactical shooter, either; just tweak the stats of the guns to be more believable (e.g. damage should be based mostly on caliber and barrel length, rather than being completely arbitrary and random weapon-by-weapon), with less of a ""flow"" of massive waves of amateurs cosplaying as cops and more of a proper ""assault"" by just one or two well-trained squads at a time, who properly take cover; clear rooms; actually do damage; and fall back after taking casualties instead of suicidally charging to the last man.

But I digress... As it is, as a goofy ""horde shooter"" that belongs in the WH40k universe rather than in... New York, the game isn't that bad. I would tentatively recommend it on sale, as it's fairly light content-wise right now and still has some significant balancing issues to be stamped out.

1272080,False,"As a longtime fan of Bag Simulator 2, it's sequel Bag Simulator 3 doesn't even come close, and it never will. I got this and most of it's DLC while it was on a steep discount; yet, while it has improved in areas such as graphics and newer ""tricks"" to heisting, the reward is far from worth it. Even on sale.

I wish I could say the good outweighs the bad here, but compared to it's predecessor it's like playing an Alpha release of Bag Simulator 2. The pricing for the DLC is ridiculous. Sure the original pricing of PD3 DLC may have permanently dropped by almost half the price they used to be; however, you could get the same amount of content and much more by paying less than 1/2 the price individually on almost all of PD2's DLC compared to that of PD3's current DLC prices. Not to mention the fact there's content you have to pay for in this game that was made for free in PD2 just says a lot. A prime example is the free and more enjoyable Hoxton Breakout heist in PD2 vs Houston breakout which was far less enjoyable. 

Then there's the issue with skill points. There's not even much reward for completing heists and you have to continuously grind just to get the little skill points you do get from doing so. There's also no individual perk system where you could go for a specific build based on the type of mission as was in in PD2. Sure you get cool gadgets like distracting guards with lures or hacking radios, but that's the only good thing here. Oh and infinite zip ties? Really? Not that this franchise was ever realistic, but that takes out the critical thinking of using them carefully like how PD2 was. And No body bags? So the heisters have infinite zip-ties but can't afford to carry even 1 or 2 body bags like in PD2? Makes sense. And moving a body in this game is an utter chore, this game attempted realism so you should be able to move a body with or without a bag by crouching or even dragging, but no that's too much. Oh and if you forgot to buy an asset for a mission you have to completely go back to the main menu vendors to adjust it. There's no more convenient mission prepping like in Bag Simulator 2.

And why do I always need to wait for a proper internet connection just to play online with myself? It's counter-intuitive. And lagging in my own game due to this? Really? 

One thing that made the prequel fun was that you actually got decent stuff for the effort you put in, heck the game would even reward you with special items just for getting achievements that in turn made the game more fun. This game, however, just urges you to keep grinding for rewards that barely feel worth the effort.

I could point out more, but I think I've said enough as there's not much going well for this game. It was and still has been a fail since the Beta release, as the improvements made are barely noticeable in the grand scheme of things.

TLDR: Just get Bag Simulator 2. Even without mods, PD3 will never come near to what PD2 has become from over a decade of development. Not to mention with Starbreeze's upcoming release of Den of Wolves. If Den of Wolves does well, PD3 will become a genuine Dead Game if it's not already before then.

This game isn't trash nor low effort, worth while it is on sale due to the DLCs. If the full game came without DLCs except maybe the licensed DLCs like Jacket and legacy heists that aren't apart of the overall story, it would be worth it at full price.
Expanding on the annoying Cloakers, they won't at shoot you and prioritize kicking you down specifically if you play with AI, all you can do is watch your AI teammates run around trying to save you, and Cloakers are always present on the map no matter what, a normal heist will see you face 1 Cloaker per 10-15 seconds.

Didn't really like the way they approached Payday 3. I liked the crazy cracked builds and hostage takers, broken ass passives, active skills etc. The skills and the passives are REALLY dumbed down here. Like there is literally no depth. But the swap from the abomination that was the Diesel engine to a proper game engine that can handle... you know... GUNS feels like a fever dream. They feel awesome, animations are snappy and thonky. The hitreg is awesome. Cops don't have 2 animations for being hit. The hitmarkers are very clean which helps the hit feel a lot. 

I hated stealth. I still do. But this game, they made it so much more interesting with a brand new gadget slot, unmasked gameplay, several new interaction animations, CQC with hostage grabbing etc. Makes for some fun times. I still go loud as soon as I can tho.

Be mindful that i got the game and a few dlc's on a massive discount, it made me remember the good old times and hope for its better future.

1272080,True,"(Copy and pasted review because it touches on every positive aspect of the game I could think to discuss.)

""I can finally recommend this game. It still isn't up to the level of Payday 2 but the potential is here and it's turned out to be a fun game. I'm just gonna talk about the stuff I like that is an improvement since Payday 2.

Zip ties are no longer finite. You're carrying around a bottomless Costco bag of zip ties. This is something that annoyed me in Payday 2.

Small Safes now have a unique lockpicking mechanic that is fun. The drill is no longer used for everything, it also doesn't take forever. Now smaller safes can be picked in a very satisfying minigame where you turn the dial until it goes green three times. It's pretty nice.

Lockpicking is actually a minigame now too. Gone are the days of just staring at an object and holding the pick button. Now there's a minigame that is actually faster than picking in Payday 2. Even messing up only penalizes you by not opening the lock sooner. Really nice change imo

Hostages are much easier to deal with. Ordering them around, using them as a human shields, booping them to the ground for a tie down. It's much easier and fluid than it was in Payday 2. Being able to grab them and throw them to the ground in a specific location beats trying to herd them in Payday 2.

New enemy types and improved favorites. New guys are grenade cops, hostage rescue is now a unique enemy, there's cops that hide and control drones to mess with you. The tazer cops are cooler, you can shoot their battery pack to shock a bunch of cops around them. The Dozer seems to have had the largest improvement and dealing with them is difficult and satisfying. You can also shoot antenas off of FBI vans to end waves at times too.

Side objectives can be found in many of the heists. Like finding specific loot in the safety deposit boxes or going the extra mile to make and employee use a biometric scanner at the jewelry store to get those last four high value items.

Now you can just choose your heist. No more waiting for the one you want to pop up or spending in game currency to buy the contracts. Just pick what you want to play.

Gun attachments are no longer an RNG gambling hell. Now you level up weapons by using them. As you level up, more parts become available to buy and install. This is a godsend.

Killstreak rewards. So now instead of starting with a grenade launcher or minigun as a primary weapon, they're now killstreak rewards you can call in during a mission. I like this option more because it doesn't tie up your primary slot.

The ECM Jammers are now tools and seperate from health/ammo deployments. That means you can have those along with health, ammo, armor, and a sentry. There are also new tools added like motion detectors, EMPs, and a few others.

The armor system is pretty cool. Now you choose a base frame that has different pros/cons. Lighter frames have less movement penalties but only hold one armor plate. Bigger frames hold more plates and ammo but has movement penalties. There's a few different plates to choose from too. Each with their own benefits and draw backs. It's really interesting to customize the armor. It also affects how many downs you are allotted as well.

All in all, the game is pretty solid and they're about to release a rework of the skills. This game isn't better than Payday 2 or at its level yet. But the improvements I listed are enough QOL improvements for me to really enjoy what it is currently. If you can catch this game on sale, I wouldn't hesitate.

One last thing. Payday 3 still supports playing DLC you don't own as long as the host has purchased it. This is a really nice feature I wish more games had. Doesn't lock your buddies out of playing new heists and you're not forced to play them with randos.

There still is no offline mode, but they have added a solo mode that is currently in beta. The solo mode is to host your own games so you're not bogging down servers or something. Idk but it's there so I thought I'd mention it.""

In addition to these positive comments, on the negative side the only thing I can really complain about is that there isnt near as MUCH content as Payday 2, but there is an ADEQUATE amount of content now. I imagine with more DLC the game will improve over time. 

Performance (at least for me personally) has also improved massively since launch and it feels good to run around, shoot things, jump, etc. The games Engine feels good now. I only really had frames drop a few times with everything maxed out with image sharpening also maxed out, but mostly ran fine on my system. At launch It was quite literally unplayable. lol.

this is after they supposedly made a ""single player beta"" which is literally just a normal multiplayer lobby locked to one player but they superimpose ""single player beta"" on the top right of your screen for no reason. also not to forget that the ""single player beta"" requires internet connection. also you have to make an third party account to even play in the first place
Made players spend hundreds of dollars on the second game to release the third in an atrocious state and even a year later its barely playable. not to forget that the game was orignally $60 and not $30 and it kinda just feels very shitty. its barely better then if a small modding team redid payday 2, and if that happened you'd at least have a decade of content to actually play with. 
also before fixing the many issues 3 had they just released a bunch of dlcs and are continuing to release dlcs in poorly marked ""year #"" bundles that theyll just exploit you with by selectively releasing things outside the year time frame to force you to buy it seperately anyway for as long as possible. payday 2 had an entire update were they added boosts to ai companions along with them being able to carry bags, payday 3 actively removed the boosts and only kept the ai holding bags so they could release an update (probably with dlc) adding it back trying to act like theyre doing so much for the community
the guns feel better and more balanced for now but thats just untill a year from now when they re-add the explosive shotgun shells and dual wield automatic shotguns for $10.99.
its simply a worse payday 2 with new paint on it, like i stated, a small modding team could make payday 2 infinitely better then this game with very little effort and youd actually have heists you want to play that arent either from the second game or just bad and poorly designed. some heists if you add certain favors will simply not tell you how to progress,  ever, you are expected to know where say drill pieces spawn if you use a favor that spawns the drill pieces on site, the game will not tell it spawned them and expects you to just know. this is basically every single objective in this game, the best you get is a vague waypoint",1753552257,1570.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5176442265510559

1272080,True,"The game is playable but there are some major flaws that NEED fixing:

- Crashes happen a lot imo
- no connection MUST be required for solo play (my wifi broke off for 3 secs and the entre heist went out)
- its a too simple compared to the PD2 game 
- Loadout is there but feels a bit stretched to me with limiting options (dlcs will improve it)
- graphics required (yeah ehm get better ones or it runs shitty)
- weapons are more or less straight up boring to me (flame throwers etc are no longer available and if they are they ll fall under the over kill weapon catagory which is more of a kill streak than a load out)
- I dont know what it is with payday in general but specifically this one: it runs like a potato. I have an RTX 4060 + i9 + 64 gb RAM + 1TB drive = it runs like a floppy trashbag. I dont know what is up but its straight up horrible. 

then the more fun part:
the game is kinda boring. Its more or less exactly payday 2 with less weapons slightly better graphics and weapon skins. I lack all the fun from PD2 and almost none of it is coming from PD3. There is basically no pre-planning phase. The heist feels more like a stretch COD multiplayer lobby then a PD2 lobby. I am seriously considering redownloading PD2 and just playing that. It runs smoother, more content, better game, and probably more people playing it. I am sub-70 imfamy now on PD3 and its not even enjoyable to me anymore. 

Mostly due to the shit running of the game i think, but also due to the simplicity of the ""puzzles in stealth"". 
Loud is kinda similar to PD2 but with less fun weapons. You have Assault Rifles and thats mroe or less it because no other weapon is viable. The one LMG you get is difficult to control, the SMGs are peashooters. There is no dual wield for pistols and... its just a NO for me atm. I think potential is there but there is so much they have to fix before we are there. This is a game you have to let cook for at least another 1-2 years from here.

1272080,True,"[h1]PAYDAY 2 [i]""Enjoyers""[/i] are incredibly spoiled with baby duck syndrome.[/h1]

For the record, I have almost 800 hours in Payday 2 and finished almost all missions on Death Sentence OD. Not all because of garbage like Bomb Forest, Goat Sim, Shacklethorne and Scarface Mansion. But it didn't affect my overall opinion of PAYDAY 3. I just think it's stupid to compare a game with ~8 years of active support to a game that barely had two.

PAYDAY 3 was going to be overshadowed by its predecessor [b]no matter the circumstances[/b]. PAYDAY 2 received too much care and polish from both developers and community over the years, however despite all that it still had a ton of problems. 

[list]
    [*][b]Diesel Engine is disgustingly outdated[/b] and barely holds together with duct tape and prayer.
    [*]Nearly [b]complete necessity for mods[/b] that apply stability and performance fixes, better UI and graphical overhauls.
    [*]It sinked into [b]DLC bullet hell[/b] astonishingly quick and reviews for said DLCs on average stay somewhere in [b]Mostly Positive[/b] zone, which is okay at best. And no it's not a result of review bombing.
    [*] Inclusion of [b]safes with pay to win elements[/b] in form of skins that give additional stats.
    [*]Implementation of [b]Epic Games online services[/b].
    [*]Insane amount of achievements that makes 100%ing the game an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy
[/list]

But [u]somehow[/u] it was fine then. 

I know PAYDAY 3 isn't perfect either. Awful UI, forced online component, update delays, radio silence, repetitiveness of heist objectives, absence of difficulties higher than Overkill and overall many questionable decisions made by the devs prior to Armor 2.0 update while expecting players to suck it up and keep buying DLCs.

However, after acquiring Year 1 edition with 70% discount, majority of problems fixed and content released I genuinely can't complain. 

[list]
    [*][b]Graphics are great[/b] and it runs very well for an Unreal Engine title. I didn't even tinker with configs.
    [*][b]Gunplay is satisfying[/b] with proper animations and it doesn't bombard you with dozens of weapons that barely distinguish from one another. Inclusion of Overkill weapons as ultimates is a nice touch. Especially the baseball bat.
    [*][b]Improved mobility[/b] makes you feel like a badass in an action movie. Hopping over cars, sliding around with the ability to shoot, introduction of proper verticality is awesome. A step up from crouch jumping, don't you think?
    [*][b]Actually usable throwables[/b] you can even make builds around, both in stealth and loud. I make them choke on my smoke nades.
    [*][b]New unmasked stealth mechanics[/b] are refreshing and inclusion of optional objectives and new tools makes it so that every player is busy and useful. 
    [*][b]Soundtrack is something I actually want to listen to again[/b], surely it's not Simon Viklund, but I'd be lying if I said that Gustavo Coutinho did a bad job. Hightlights for me are [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-6JcePv9TM] Heatwave[/url],[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD2CEbFeh80] Masterful Deceit[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNBZsaCYifE] Teardown Protocol[/url].
    [*][b]It stays grounded[/b] without sinking too much into superhero sim with over the top stuff like Stoic and 4 armor dodge builds or having giant spoons as melee weapons. Surely meme potential is what kept PAYDAY going, but pursuing that route again would be absurd.
    [*]IDK how some people say that heists are mid, [b]I think they might be the best the series ever seen[/b]. Some examples. Robbing a Google-like facility to steal servers with important data while screwing its AI. Storming one of NYPD facilities to repossess some evidence and contraband. Breaking one of your buddies out during his active trial during the day. Infiltrating Wall Street and manipulating the stock market. And all of those have both stealth and loud approaches, increasing replayability. Holy bangers.
[/list]

For a couple dozen hours, or even a hundred or two if you want everything unlocked and mastered, along a few dedicated buddies this is a worthy experience. Idk why nowadays people expect games like these to last hundreds or even thousands of hours. Some things aren't meant to last, so enjoy it while you can and when it runs its course, move along.

1272080,True,"Part of my Highschool memories was of playing Payday 2, but I do have to say, that I find myself enjoying this more.

One aspect is the improvement to the detection mechanic and stealth in general, I enjoy it a LOT more than it's previous iteration. You can even get through an entire heist without putting your mask on thanks to the game allowing you to lockpick, crouch, interact while not having it on. There are even public, private and secure areas which allow you a bit more planning and freedom when scouting out the place. 

It even allows me to, with my favourite weapons, be able to sneak in as best I could, without any debuffs from what I chose.  I enjoy it because I know if sh*t ever hits the fan, I'm not forced to fight with bad/weak weapons that I chose so I wouldn't be noticed at a first glance.

I know that this lessens the realism of the game, but c'mon, if we wanted realism, we would go outside wouldn't we?

If you are interested, I recommend watching someone go through the Payday 3 Tutorial levels online so you can see what is possible in the game before committing to it.

1272080,False,"I thought I'd give this game another try seeing as it's been at least over a year since the launch. Unfortunately the game is still in a very disappointing state and pales in comparison to the previous entries. The game launched with barely any content, far less than PDTH and PD2. 

It's as if there is two extra steps to do each task, for example assembling the drill usually requires you to collect multiple parts individually and assemble them. What? There was no need to change this at all, maybe add some flashy interact animations, sure! To complicate something that is just inherently simple and requires no change, if it ain't broke don't fix.

Networking has become a huge hassle especially for my region, the lowest ping I can get is 150ms because to play online there is no P2P hosting, everything is wired up to a dedicated server for which the closest server is Hong Kong for me. Such a backwards idea with no thought put in on how this might affect users outside of the regions that have dedicated servers.

This game should've never released, I'd argue if this game didn't release and content continued to release on PD2, we would be seeing double the daily counts currently. I would go as far to say an engine upgrade for 2 would've been a far better idea considering the plethora of content on offer that no new release could even try emulate. The story explanation for why the crew is back heisting is absolutely ridiculous and ruins what is an amazing conclusion on the story for the crew.

Following a rocky start this game has slowly crawled it ways back into light, but the issue with that being that the game now, is finally in the state it should have been released in. While the heists are fun and new, the amount of them pales in comparison to the previous game. Speaking of, comparing Payday 3 to Payday 2 is night and day. Both games have their advantages, Payday 2 is a lot more goofy and comedic with its weaponry and how the overall game acts, while Payday 3 takes a lot more of a realistic approach, which does actually work for it. The guns are fun and the perk system is fun and interesting to mess around with, but another issue is the paid content. For a game approaching 2 years old, a good chunk of the weaponry and the heists are locked behind DLC, which would be okay, if not for the fact the base game is $45!

This game doesn't have that issue. Now, that isn't the only reason I am writing this positive review. A lot of the new mechanics such as lockpicking, safe cracking, OVERKILL weapons, and weapon upgrades that you get through leveling and progressing via heists. Each heist is unique, and though I haven't been able to touch any of the DLC, the game without still has a lot to do.

Not as much as PAYDAY 2, but that game has an entire DECADE of updates, content release, etc. Let's not forget how buggy and unbalanced 2 was on launch. Starbreeze doesn't have the greatest track record for great releases.

I have yet to encounter any bugs or softlocks.

1272080,True,"TL:DR - This game is much better than advertised by most people. Different from Payday 2, inferior in some ways, but still quite fun.

I initially delayed getting this game for a while because of the bad reviews my friends and randoms on the internet gave it. Recently I found it on sale and I finally got it. Now that I've played it, and perhaps because of the quite bad expectations I had, I quite enjoy it.

Now, is it the same as Payday 2? Of course not, Payday 2 was a great game, one we have played a lot and were used to. Payday 3 is different, sure. But would we want just a copy with better graphics? I don't think so.

Movement:
The movement is different, and Payday 2's movement felt crisp and satisfying (whenever you weren't using ladders). However, Payday 3's is also crisp, adds new interesting mechanics, and is quite good imo.

Shooting:
The shooting mechanics are much much improved. The shooting in Payday 2 is one of the big reasons I didn't find loud heists that much fun. Shooting feels a bit sluggish and inaccurate in Payday 2, which for a CS:GO/CS2 player is quite frustrating.

NPC vision:
The better NPC vision accuracy is a much needed improvement. No more guards seeing you with their third rear eye.

Casing mode:
The casing mode revamp is exactly what it needed. It makes it actually useful not to put on your mask right away. A lot of new actions, you can run, crouch, open doors, all kinds of stuff.

Menus:
This is the thing that is really lacking imo. The user experience of the menus is quite horrible, not user friendly, and in the case of waiting for a server to play on, quite slow. The skill build page feels a little overwhelming, it's unorganized and feels like a chore. The weapons shop menu feels like it's lacking something, it's quite barren, and it's also unorganized. The heists page is a little more organized than payday 2, but it lacks the dynamic and alive feel. And searching for servers is usually a 3-4 minute wait, which feels a bit weird since it's not matchmaking, only finding a server. It all feels a bit meh.

So overall, a fun game, with the vibes and essence of Payday, but in an upgraded version. Even some maps are the same to keep the nostalgia going.

Cloakers downing you through walls, doors not working, the ""observed"" notification is usually just a suggestion, etc. As an example, escaping the last DLC heist (when going loud) is just hell. No one play-tested that at all. Roof with no cover, snipers everywhere, saboteurs can destroy TWO objectives instantly, it takes a millennium to complete ... fun for the whole family. Other heists: manager's computer is not in managers office, the trigger to access the vault in the penthouse heist works only when it feels like it, cameras can see you through walls (mainly online because the sync between players is non-existent) BUT ..

Even after listing more than enough issues for this game to earn negative rating, I'd say it's pretty good (if bought on sale). The heists' settings are all varied and interesting, weapons sounds are cool, there's enough perks/abilities for various loud builds, graphics are pretty nice for a game like this .. the game itself is fun and overall an upgrade to Payday 2, mainly because of the engine upgrade, I guess.

1272080,False,"I've been a Payday 2 fan for years, and despite the poor reputation of this game, I saw it on sale and decided to buy it. I figured that the game would have changed over the year or so since it came out and expected great gameplay.

After buying the game, I noticed that it seemed very futuristic and the UI was very overwhelming to me. I played through the tutorials anyway and figured I would eventually learn to love it and warm up to the game. This never happened.

The game only has a few gamemodes/maps that are open to beginners, two of which are the same thing on the same map. It feels like it guides you through how to do the missions too much, where each time feels extremely repetitive and like the same thing every time, and the AI-generated images for the characters, as well as how blind and unrealistic the guards are, just make the game really lame and give it the ""cash grab"" feel.

I've tried to play through more of it and hoped I would start liking it, but I've already had 3 hours of it, and I don't like it at all. I hate how they replaced the amazing Payday 2 skill system with something where you have to play to learn the base skills and then level them up and how you can pretty much do everything with having no skills unlocked. Having things like ""grit,"" ""rush,"" or ""edge"" just makes no sense to me and seems extremely complicated.

Overall, I hate to say it, but I really hate this game. I don't like it at all and will never play this again; it's just not fun or enjoyable at all to me.

-heavy rng mechanics that involve changed to the specials
-naders can throw random gas nades you cant react to because its instant and drain half your hp
-snipers are just as ridiculous, they can, and will INSTANTLY snipe you sometimes for nearly all your hp,
-all the skills are worse, give you terrible stats  like movement speed.
-terrible gun selection and lack of variety
- the jump in difficulty from very hard to overkill is a complete joke.
-you can play very hard mode while sleeping
-overkill without a sensible team is ridiculous
-less engaging and interactive heists
-you stand in circles and sit and do nothing for alot of the objectives
-next to no replayability
-theres like 18 heists
-4 starter heists that are pointless after a few hours since the rewards become irrelevent
-3 or 4 really poorly made heists that are just a waiting game
-in reality you have like 10 playable heists that are somewhat fun
- every guard looks the same
-skill trees are dumbed down(move faster,do more damage,take less damage)
-armor works really weirdly 
-lack of information in skill trees
-very few meaningful improvements to the 2nd game,

1272080,False,"Well, almost 2 years has passed since Payday 3's launch, but some major bugs and the lack of content are still present. I remember Payday 2 had somewhat a disastrous launch too back in 2013, but in less than 2 years the devs managed to make it shine with various patches, DLC, collabs and some free content... something they're not doing with Payday 3!

Now, let's start with the bugs i encountered during the gameplay:

- Tasers/Zappers often spawns unarmed... what kind of cop on earth tries to stop 4 bank robbers without a weapon?
- During stealth in First World Bank, when you get caught after looting the vault, the C4 used to blow the wall and escape doesn't spawn, making you stuck in the bank and forcing you to fail the heist.
- Some guards during stealth can see the player through walls. How?
- I dunno if it can considered a bug, but Cloakers now are only targeting the player, while in Payday 2 they targeted both player and bots.
- Of course the Nebula server error when you try to host a lobby with friends... it happens everytime...


Let's talk about the content lack:

- Single player mode still in beta after 2 years... seriously? Why do i need internet connection to play alone with bots?
- Weapon customization is really poor, there are just a few modifications unlike Payday 2 where you could turn your weapon into whatever you wanted.
- Just a few weapons and no melee
- Skill trees are poor too... the builds aren't as effective as Payday 2...
- No perk decks
- No Death Sentence difficulty
- No gangs/guards/law enforcement/militias variants like Payday 2

Now let's take a look at the gameplay:

- Special enemies doesn't spawn immediately at the first assault wave like Payday 2. They will now spawn only in specific waves, which makes the gameplay long and boring.
- The gunplay is total garbage. Even with a proper build you can't deal damage with pistols, some rifles and some smgs. This turns the gunplay into something like CoD/Battlefield, making you stick to use automatic rifles or shotguns to deal damage, which is monotone and boring unlike Payday 2, where you could dash around the map and kill everyone with akimbo pistols, smgs and shotguns.
- In Payday 2 you could dominate a cop or a guard by default without a build. Why here in Payday 3 i need a specific skill or perk to do that? That doesn't make sense!

Having said this, i'm sorry but after seeing the game in these conditions after 2 years and 200 hours of gameplay, i just uninstalled it and keep playing Payday 2. In my honest opinion Payday 3 is close to be a dead game... i'm not even sure if it will make it past 2026 at this point.

1272080,True,"Not as good as Payday 2 but if you've already done everything in that game, this is a good time if you get it on sale. It still has a lot of elements of the questionable decisions Starbreeze made during development, like a forced 3rd party account, lobbies that take over a minute to load into, and a lot of stuff that just feels like it was designed to protect the integrity of a microtransaction-based business model (even though there aren't any microtransactions as of writing this review). I imagine that a lot of that backend weirdness is hard to patch or a bit too baked into the game design to fix immediately so I'll give it a pass--for now.

There are 4 things I think need to be addressed from a design standpoint though before I can truly call this a worthy successor to the legendary Payday 2

1. Fix the subtitles--make sure they show everything that's being said. There are many instructions and callouts from Shade (the new Bain basically) that are just straight up not subtitled. Not only is this terrible if you have a hearing impairment, even as someone with perfectly functional hearing I sometimes miss audio callouts in the middle of gun fights. 

2. Make it so everyone can listen to the briefing together in the lobby before starting the mission. If I'm playing with 4 friends, we should all be on the same page about the story. Also make the text actually match the voice acting. Some of them are so unbelievably incorrect it's crazy--literal whole paragraphs that are missing, even though there's absolutely space for them. 

3. Make it so I can see how much each bag is worth when I secure it. It was a big part of the feeling of feedback from Payday 2 that made crime satisfying. Now, when you toss a bag in the van/chopper, you have no idea how much it could be worth. 

4. Add more complex missions/multi day heists. Most of the missions currently in the game are a bit simplistic both from a narrative and from a gameplay perspective. Some of the most memorable missions from the Payday 2 were the multi day ones with a story that continued onto the second or 3rd day, like Hoxton Breakout, Framing Frame, and Goat Simulator. I have a feeling this one might involve them fixing whatever backend jank is going on with their lobby system to implement effectively though. 

Bonus 5th thing: I wouldn't mind having Bain or Locke be our handler again. I'm not really a fan of the new person. I understand there are story reasons why Bain isn't here for us but also they could easily write Bain back into the story. IYKYK. 

Literally all of these things were things that Payday 2 already did so it's baffling to me that they somehow didn't manage to make it work for this one. Bare minimum, I think most people expect feature parity to the previous game in the series. We all understand that there's no way any studio could feasibly make a new game that releases with as much content as Payday 2, a game that had nearly a decade of content updates. But Payday 3 feels like a game made by a studio that remembers what it was like to play Payday 2, and tried to create a sequel without ever going back and playing the rest of the series during development.

Overall though, I do enjoy many of the changes to the gameplay. It was very possible to completely break Payday 2's difficulty with OP builds that could 3 shot dozers and basically be invincible (which don't get me wrong, was it's own type of fun). Many of the systems in this game still manage to be interesting without being so abusable, which I think makes for a really solid framework for expanding upon with new and interesting content. I'm willing to give Starbreeze time on this because I'd rather it be done right rather than done fast--there are plenty of other games to play and I'll happily come back with my money if this game continues to improve.",1752644242,1041.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.515964686870575

The game really isnt bad. Its not payday2 kind of good but its above mediocre. I think what people fail to realize is the reason why payday2 has so much more content is because it was getting updates for 15 years. So far with 1 year of payday3 the dlc and updates are well above good. As for just how the game function. yeah payday2 does seem to have more fluidity but payday3 has stuff that payday2 never brought in and executed them well. People fail to realize that payday2 on release or at least even a few years after its release wasnt all that great of a game either. It was most definitley not bad but it also had so many flawes that was sooner fixed throughout the 15 years of the game.

In other words would i recomend this over payday2...depends. would i rather play payday2...probably. is this game bad...heck no. cop this game on sale and get the dlc its worth the few bucks. and if you havent played PD2 go ahead and get that as well.

1272080,True,"Let’s be honest — PAYDAY 3 didn’t have the smoothest launch. Server issues, content limitations, and high expectations set by its predecessor made a lot of players frustrated early on. But here’s the thing: that doesn’t mean it’s a bad game. Far from it.

Once you actually get into the action, PAYDAY 3 delivers where it counts — the heists are intense, the gunplay feels tighter than ever, and the core fantasy of being part of a slick, coordinated criminal crew is absolutely alive and well. Stealth is smoother, the AI is more dynamic, and every mission has that chaotic “anything can happen” energy that keeps you on your toes.

The new mechanics around loadouts, skill trees, and heist progression show that the devs are thinking long-term — and yeah, that’s exactly what happened with PAYDAY 2. Remember that? It launched with way less content than what we see in it today, but years of support turned it into one of the most beloved co-op shooters ever.

So here’s a thought: give PAYDAY 3 time. The foundation is solid, the vibes are right, and the developers are already working hard to bring in updates and fan-requested features. It’s easy to forget how much PAYDAY 2 grew — and we’re seeing the same journey begin here.

If you enjoy tactical co-op gameplay, loud vs. stealth choices, and the pure thrill of pulling off a perfect heist with friends, then PAYDAY 3 already has plenty to offer — and it’s only going to get better.

Cons: The first negative piece I have about Payday 3 is going to be the server issue. I truly cannot fathom what would make Starbreeze make this an online only game, AND remove the ability to play heists solo. There's a solo mode beta, but it still takes a decent bit of time to load even while using fibre and a high end PC. The weapon variety is also abysmal comparitively when you're not considering DLC weapons. I enjoy the waves rework, but I hate the ""Final charge"" system.

1272080,True,"I enjoyed Payday 2 a lot (over 400 hours logged), but didn't buy Payday 3 at launch due to two main issues: server connectivity issues and no single player.  

So far I have not encountered any server issues, and single player is currently in 'beta' although I haven't tried yet.  I bought Payday 3 for $10 USD and can say I don't regret, but definitely won't be buying any of the DLC full price.  As of writing I think my preference would have to be Payday 2,. which isn't to say Payday 3 isn't enjoyable, because so far it is.  

Comparing to Payday 2: most major difference is clearly a visual improvement, the stealth and casing are more interactive, there are a few new enemies, the perk system is a little different, and there are some quality of life changes (e.g. unlimited zip ties).  I haven't had a chance to do all the heists yet, especially not DLC heists, but so far they're alright; if you've played Payday 2, all these heists will feel familiar, in fact there are at least two heists returning from Payday 2 (First World Bank and Cook Off).  

I'll continue playing Payday 3, at least until max level and completing all heists, and perhaps update the review with more opinions at that point.

1272080,False,"I pre-ordered this game, and since then I let this game cook for a while. 

Let's face it, this game has a lot of kinks it desperately needs ironed out.

- As everyone keeps repeating, the Bain replacement comments on every action you do. If you're like me, and you spend more time during the Final Assault than any other assault wave, you know she get's annoying really fast. The frequency she says things needs to be turned up. I don't want to hear her every 10 seconds, I would be fine with hearing her every 2 minutes or so. I want an occasional reminder, if it's really necessary, but not a constant one. I feel like on Cook Off, I hear her say ""The cops aren't gonna stop until you're locked away or dead"" more than I hear her say what ingredient I need to add. 

- Weapons. I want the classic Payday 2 experience of where there's a LOT of guns, a lot of ways to customize them, and some of them are definitely stronger than others. I remember when I was strong enough to reload in front of an Overkill-level Dozer with no fear and be able to mow them down relatively easily. Now? I can't even look at them without them deleting my health. Even with the best gun I currently have, I just don't feel as powerful as I could be, and the guns I see feel lacking.

- Cloakers. Maybe this is a skill issue, but it feels like I get downed by a Cloaker every 20 seconds. Why don't they target bots in solo mode btw? They literally only ever target me. They didn't do that in Payday 2 singleplayer, the police brutality was indiscriminate. (Edit: Not a skill issue, why the fuck did the game throw 4 cloakers at me in a span of 15 seconds what the hell is that bullshit)

- AI needs a little extra care in some places. I got put into a situation where a Cloaker downed me in the vault of the nightclub map, and none of the bots came to help me. They all stood outside the room like the cops paid them to look the other way momentarily. When I was finally downed, and handcuffed (never seen that before, I forgot that was even a thing.) Chains teleported to my position, and revived me, but I still killed the Cloaker myself. Chains then proceeded to get stuck in place and he didn't move for the rest of the match. How fun :)

I might potentially just be stupid since I played this game for like 10 hours when the game released, and only played again when my beloved schizo chicken Jacket got added (I'm a Jacket main, go figure), but the shouting mechanic feels worse. Correct me if I'm wrong but shouting to intimidate a civilian (or cop if you had the perk) and interacting was all the same button, why is that not the case now? (Minor update: Yes I'm stupid, but for reasons I did not mention here)

I do like the various interacting animations, I have noticed there are a few interactions that don't have animations, which sucks. But there's so few I can't even name many besides the keycard pickup right of the top of my head.",1752298701,2051.0,True,False,False,10,1,0.510782778263092

1272080,False,"A lot of the dialogue in this game is missing subtitles. I found a typo in the description for one of the mission assets. You're forced to make a third party account. And then you have to connect it to your Steam account, lest you're apprehended by a login screen every single time you boot up the game. It takes almost a full minute of waiting on the title screen in order to ENTER A LOBBY, which once you actually make it in, the game automatically starts a 5 minute countdown before the mission forcibly starts.

I paid real money to purchase a DLC for the game, and I did not receive the gun that I paid for in the DLC. This has been a problem that Starbreeze has let happen for weeks. Look up ""Starbreeze Controversy"" on google and take your pick for reasons why you cannot and should not trust this company.

The gameplay itself is very solid, and feels smoother and more fluid than Payday 2, at least, if you ignore the occasional screen-freezing that regularly happens at least twice a mission. The game looks great, and I've had a lot of time to admire the great graphics while searching for a key item in a mission that won't give me any indicators to help find it. The music in the game is fine, but half of the tracks sound like remixed versions of songs that I liked better in Payday 2. The skill tree is diverse and larger than Payday 2's, but 90% of the skills just give you 10% bonuses to a stat and there's nothing nearly as interesting as Payday 2 stuff like Inspire or akimbo pistol dodge builds. There are many good things that this game improves upon from Payday 2, but the monkey's paw curls with almost every one of them.

For the most part, I have been enjoying the game, but I cannot recommend that other people play it due to the plethora of problems that I personally have had with it and the lack of care that the company behind the game seems to have for their playerbase.

Edit: It sure took them long enough, but they fixed the DLC not giving the weapon. This has been a very negative review, but I do believe this game has and will get better over time, albiet slowly.

They also made it so everyone who pre-ordered got screwed because they released the pre-order bonus as a standalone dlc to get extra money.

About half of the currently existing weapons and heists, which there aren't that many of to begin with, have to be paid for through DLC's. Honestly, they should've just kept adding new content to the game they already had instead of selling back the same content for more money.

There are a couple of new cool ideas, but they are implemented in the worst way possible + a lot of base game mechanics from pd2 were just cut. At the same time perfectly working simplest mechanics were remade for some reason into the most awkward mess i've ever seen.

And I was also one of these haters before, but for 9euros I was like what the hell, why not.
And I can 100% honestly say that I do not regret buying the game at all.
I did not really have any bugs in the menu or ingame (the single bug I found was cops/loot clipping through stairs) and did not have any server problems.
The gameplay is fun, and now with the current armor system it gives me payday2 gameplay wibes with the fast action.
Build diversity is a bit low atm, but im sure that more will come with time. A lot of people either forgot, or never actually experienced it, but on release payday2 also had around this kinda number of builds. And just like with payday2, ""fixing"" this takes time and content.
A big plus for payday3 is the stealth. I did not really like payday2 stealth stuff, but 3 brings awesome changes which make it more casual friendly (there is no need for concealment stats thank you very much!) and deep at the same time.
The soundtrack is still awesome just like in the second game, and the gang voices are also good just the same. I also got used to Shade after some time, the only thing I do not like is she shittn on Bain during cook off. The enemy voices are a bit of a mix.

1272080,False,"TL:TL:DR -> This game is fundamentally not fun in 2025 and it won't be in 2035 either (no matter the sale)

TL:DR -> 
Playing this game after having played payday 2 is like going to an ice cream parlor and ordering vanilla ice cream with sprinkes.
Except you're brought chocolate ice cream, with 1/3rd of the size, and the sprinkles have been replaced with micro turds.

Chocolate: Completely different game to payday 2
Size: Literally 1/5th the heists, 1/2 of the perks, 1/10th the weapons
Turd Replacement: This game literally devolves mechanics or in some cases straight up guts them.

Actual Review:
As someone that has ~450 hours on payday 2, this game is an upgrade graphically and really pretty to look at, but a fundamental downgrade in every single other aspect of this game.

I purposefully waited over a year to try this out because the devs have shown such care for payday 2 that I knew this wouldn't get abandoned. However after playing I realized that this game is just fundamentally not fun. Unless it gets a complete rework, or I get amnesia and forget how great payday 2 plays, I will never recommend this game, even tho I know that this will be supported for the next 5-10 years with amazing updates.

Upon installation I was greeted with a login page which i haven't seen since 2015 runescape genre games, not a great start after realizing this means that you can't play without internet, however not an incredible obstacle considering the year.

Upon launching the tutorial immediately I noticed just how wrong it feels to play this. All the controls have been swapped out and merged which makes rearranging them a complete nightmare because all of the sudden I have 'F' marking guards and emoting for some reason instead of it being 2 separate buttons. Crouch jumping is completely gone and instead replaced with a slide which doesn't work in stealth at all. The perk tree is unbearable to look at, I genuinely don't understand how the perk tree made it past the initial concept stages, nonetheless its there.

Unfortunately due to a lack of players, the servers you'll be connecting to are going to be trash, this is coming from someone that's typically on US-West servers, your experience may vary, and this isn't a fault of the developers rather just a by-product of a low player-base.

On the topic of stealth I completed an entire heist without having to mask up, which for any payday 2 players might sound like a dream but the moment you actually try it you realize immediately how boring it is and how much it affects the replayability. Oh goodluck trying to stealth on higher difficulties too, with the incredibly broken AI, incredibly broken guard sensitivity mechanic, and the overall laginess of camera detection, on top of taking away 2 pagers and adding in an unkillable roaming guard. Stealth has been completely to remove as much fun as possible for the sake of ""added challenge""

Cherry on top: Shade or whatever her name is, is completely insufferable to listen to (subjective opinion).

After realizing how boring stealth was (at this point I already knew I was going to refund this), I launched up a loud heist just to see if there was ANY replayability, and I'll grant it this is an aspect of the game that can become GREAT with future updates, however seeing how bad the stealth is and just how incredibly un-fixable it is, I have to refund it.

This game is supposed to be an absolute 10/10 and its clear that so many passionate people worked on this project, however somewhere down the line in the command chain someone was either completely oblivious or just didn't care to understand what made playing PayDay 2 so phenomenal, and it casts an incredibly great shadow over the entire game that for me personally was so great that I had to send in a refund within 1 hour of playtime.

I feel sorry because someone incredibly fundamental to this games core mechanics just didn't CARE, and it has completely tarnished the entire game. Unless there is an entire gameplay focused rework announced I will never try this game again, I haven't even gotten to see what this game is worth because of how abhorrent it felt to play.

Edit: After looking into the NEW CEO of Starbreeze's past (The guy behind EA's 10 year long micro transaction hell) I can for certain say that even if this game has SOME fun aspects to it. It is literally cooked in its longevity aspect, if it cant even match 1/5th of paydays content size, then rest assured it will never even get close to it in the future since player numbers are dwindilling and resources are getting scarcer, expect at the very most 5 paid for dlc maps before this game is completely abandoned due to revenue stream.

As a huge fan of Payday 2 this is nothing but a stark reminder that corporate greed will mercilessly ruin everything and anything in order to gain temporary monatery funds. I plan on fully completing this game as a thank you to the wonderful game devs at Overkill, and then never touching this again unless a fairy tale happens and Starbreeze decides to actually invest into this and give the players an abundance of content for free.",1751953771,1205.0,True,False,False,2,1,0.5238095521926879

1272080,True,"This is by far one of the most conflicting feeling reviews I have ever had to make.

I love the idea of this game being great. It has the bones of being a proper successor to Payday 2, HOWEVER it lacks the massive hoard of content and character that Payday 2 has. The overall game feel is much more refined, FPS is massively improved, the graphics look *good*, the game doesn't crash. Overall what they've done is make what looks more like a proof of concept or a tech demo then an actual game compared to Payday 2.

We all knew that due to the massive buildup of DLC and drip feed content in Payday 2 it makes this game look tiny in comparison, but it makes things much harder to justify playing Payday 3 over 2.

I'm only giving it a recommended rating because of the potential. There is a real chance that over time the game improves as more content is added, but right now I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it.",1751935788,3898.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5
1272080,True,"When this game first came out there was some struggles here and there. I was very upset that it was only online and this is shared with others. After a year and multiple changes this game has become fantastic to revisit. I 100% Payday 2 and I plan to do the same with this game.  Its definitely different than payday 2 in a lot of ways. Recoil, skills, damage, move speed, movement, and a couple of other things. My favorite is the skills. In Payday 2 you had to gain xp then you can use it to buy those perk cards and skills. This one they are all roped in together. You research the sets and you only need to research the first one. Afterwards, every game you play you get a number of xp that goes TO EACH CARD IN THAT SET! I used to spend hours grinding just to max out the perk deck and skills. Here you research a set, play, and eventually unlock them. Going back to skills you can mix which ones you want. I think you are little limited on what you can use together. However, the build potential is still there and probably better. Stealth was a huge part of Payday 2 for me. In Payday 3 you can run the traits of yakuza for speed then have the abilities of hacker. It is astounding the builds you can make. I hope they continue to update this game and add the old heist. Cook off one of my favorites is a blast and easier. The announced chemicals you have to put in are usually 90% correct unlike Bain. The small stabs to the previous version is hilarious. 100% recommend people grab this game.",1751925401,283.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

And for some reason enemies won't spawn with guns so they're not even a threat, the DIALOG LAGS (how do you fuck that up??), Bulldozers and Cloakers spawn on the lowest difficulty (for some reason??) and the new ""Dye Packs"" mechanic is completely unneccessary.

1272080,True,"I was big into Payday 2 and I do understand why so many fans might not like this game. However I will say overall this is a very fun game and it does feel like payday. I think my biggest gripe is the lack of content while also placing so much of the existing content behind paywalls. I understand the company needs to make money so they can create more content in the future but there's a fine balance between a fully operable base game and DLC. It's very frustrating to pay the $30-$60 for a game that has half of the content its previous entry had at launch. There seems to be very few weapons and masks to choose from along with not that much gun customization, and the little that their is is all the same. All the rifles have the same stocks and none of them seem unique at all along with them taking away the lasers and flashlight attachments, not sure why they did that. Now I'm not saying that this game should have had everything Payday 2 now has at launch because that's an unfair comparison. Payday 2 has been out for a long time, all I'm saying is I would have liked to see the same amount as Payday 2 when that game first launched, I believe that's fare. Along with some bugs and laggy servers every now and then. I do understand that by the time I started playing Payday 3 a lot of those bugs had been patched so I'm seeing the best Payday 3 can be at the moment. So overall at the time of this review I will say that I'm highly enjoying this game and I can't wait to see what the developers do. And of course, I'm hoping it's not all locked behind a paywall. To leave this review on a positive note I do very much enjoy the changes they have made such as being able to hold hostages and guards not immediately shooting you in private areas. I think this adds realism and better strategic planning for heisters. And I love love love that your XP stays with you throughout the missions and that host changes happen when the original host leaves. This was a HUGE frustration I had with Payday 2. The gun play does feel slower but still Payday and I don't mind it. Also the ability to carry two bags is amazing, I know it's small but it's these things that truly make it a great game and great additions to the Payday franchise.

1272080,False,"Разочарование

Так одним словом можно описать эту игру. Я когда купил этот продукт, думал получу геймплей PAYDAY 2 2013-2014 годов, когда еще была командная игра, оружия были сбалансированы примерно одинаковы и вообще трава была зеленей, вместо этого я получил какую-то недопародию с убогим геймплеем и системой прокачки как у дешевых инди рпг игр.

 Эту игру нельзя сравнивать с серией PAYDAY. Она не должна носить это гордое название и носить цифру 3. Эту игру можно назвать жалкой копией другой копии - Crime Boss: Rockay City. Эта игра по сути не имеет ничего общего ни с PAYDAY The Heist, ни с PAYDAY 2. Эту игру делали не для того чтобы порадовать фанатов и подарить примерно такой же геймплей. Разработчики даже не хотят чинить кривую и убогую оптимизацию, вместо этого они уже выкатили DLC чтобы состричь $$$.

Первым делом зайдя на самое первое ограбление из трейлеров ""сбербанк"" как его называют рускоязычные фанаты. Я для меня было удивление увидеть в этой игре спустя 2 года после релиза прямо ну очень убогую оптимизацию. Лаги сопровождают начало ограбления, затем лаги проходят, выходит нормальные фпс ~80-90 К/C и сопровождаются неожиданными дропами до 10 К/С, затем спустя время все нормально. Тоесть о приятной игре не может идти и речи.

Чувство от попадания в тушку копа с любого огнестрельного оружия нет абсолютно никаого, попал ты или нет ты понимаешь не по характерному отскоку/падению или регдолу, а по хитмаркеру. Разработчики специально сделали хитмаркер чтобы ты понимал, что стала с твоим врагом после выстрела. Понять этого до того как коп упадет на землю НЕ-РЕ-А-ЛЬ-НО!

Прокачка в этой игре является как в очень дешевой инди игре, тоесть вот ты играешь с car-4 и прокачиваешь его уровень когда поиграешь по-больше он станет имбой, про особый подбор атачментов для оружии я молчу как это сделано в PAYDAY 2, больше похоже на уровень The Heist. Об уровне билдостроения в PAYDAY 2 (даже после 100 update) не может идти речи.

 Разделения сложности абсолютно бессмысленно, я начиная с 8 уровня игра на сложности ""очень трудно"" при этом падал дай ты бог 1 раз за всю игру и то либо от случайного падения либо от неожиданного клокера. Спустя время и сложность ""overkill"" стала смехотворной. Често сказать сложость я надеялся будет как в PAYDAY 2 оверкилл после 24.2 update'а и максимальная к примеру death wish, которая повторюсь до 2016 года была действительно тяжелой сложностью, но при этом если иметь полностью подготовленную команду людей которые работают в команде становится хоть и не легкой, но вполне выполнимой задачей.

Дальше можно подметить почти полное отсутсвие сюжета, такое чувства что его просто нету. Добавили очередную тупую 3.14зду феменистку, которая абсолютно и беспреворотно не вписывается в стиль, в отличии от загадочного Бэйна.

Вообщем если подвести черту -  хочешь погриндить, иди в игры для этого например в path of exile, grim dawn на крайняк PAYDAY The Heist. Все таки я думал что разработчики пофиксили за 2 с лишнем годом игру. Оказалось что забии хyй. Если хотите поиграть в действительно хороший симулятор про ограблений с интересным пусть и гриндом, прокачкой, лором, сюжетом то вам дорога на старый PAYDAY 2 до 2016 года.

1272080,False,"Game is good from the perspective of gameplay, it's signature style, music and new features. They added new mechanics, made it more casual in some parts but decision to make it completely online is the main problem. 
Graphic stays the same as payday 2. They added more poligons, details, interiors became more filled and so on but faces and bodies of guards and civs stay the same. Maybe it's their style or it was made for age restriction but it looks like update of their old engine not new Unreal Engine.
It's impossible to play stealth missions with random 1-2 sec freezes. I lost many 30mins+ stealth missions cause of this. When you try to look out guards behind walls and it happens you find yourself after 2 secs of freeze in the middle of corridor or room in a view of guard with half filled scale of detection. Even in solo mode problems stay. 
And like in Payday 2 there are a huge amount of cash grabbing dlc's but they were able to do it even worse. You can't connect to created by another player dlc maps like in Payday 2 if you don't own it. 
Many bugs with chat (or with windowed/full screen mode?), bugs with spotted enemies and civilians, ai behavior, long creation of lobbies, errors due connection, due lobby creation even if you buy weapons or mods it can disconnect you or give you infinite loading. You can't open your game to public after you completed it in solo stealth in <with friends> mode, can't kick in lobby and problems with borderless window/full screen that drop your fps significantly.

While I didnt play at launch, the game seems to be in a better state than it had initially was released in. This review is subject to change as I continue to play the game, however it reflects my mindset with my first 17 or so hours of the game 

Pros: 
-while a bit cumbersome, the skills trees have a good amount of depth to them. Granted I have not unlocked all the trees, but the foundation for a variety of builds is set
-stealth has massively improved IMO, with a greater variety of ways to complete heists, QOL features while in casing mode, new features such as the QR code system etc 
-gunplay feels good with a decent range of attachments
-overall gameplay loop is satisfying with new special enemies and heist designs 
-finally added beta single player 

Cons:
-while i personally dont mind the attachment/gun leveling system, I could see how others may not like being locked out of attachments based on weapon level. On the same note of guns, I wish there were more guns and more unique guns/weapons. Admittedly this can be solved with future content releases and updates, but rn the gun choice feels a little dry
-number of heists: Similar to the gun argument, this can be solved with future content releases and updates, but right now there is a relatively limited number of heists even with the DLC and update heists

[h3]Or: ""Please Don't Buy This Game; A Cautionary Tale""[/h3]

Payday 3, even after all these years, is still a very basic and mediocre shooter that completely dodges what made the other games in the series fun. The weapons are dull, the customization sucks ass, the characters (both new and old) are flat and have nothing to hold on to, the heists and enemies range from boring to annoying, the game is fucking online-only with DLC, etc.

And yet, for almost two years, I held out hope. I kept saying to myself, ""It was the same with Payday 2! They'll fix it eventually!"" However, their constant fumbling of both the game and their staff have proven to me that they are one of the most incompetent, arrogant, and stubborn game companies I have ever had the displeasure of giving my money to. From recent layoffs of the French team, to ignoring the suggestions and feedback of fans and content creators, to releasing the game in a completely unfinished state. They have proven, time and time again, that they are physically incapable of treating the game, their employees, their company, and their fans with the smallest amount of respect, being around so long because of blind, hopeful Payday fans like me who didn't know better and/or were in constant denial about the game and its future.

I was a massive fucking moron for thinking this game would ever be good. Hell, I fucking preordered it for a reward that became fucking DLC, because I can go fuck myself for supporting the game early, apparently. Everything about this game, before and after launch, was/is a red flag, and is a true reflection of Starbreeze as a company and game studio. Don't buy the game, don't buy the DLC; hell don't even play the fucking game (not that you'd want to.)",1751448435,7436.0,True,False,False,4,0,0.4974642395973205

1272080,True,"PAYDAY 3 emerges as a highly anticipated continuation of the beloved cooperative heist series, delivering an adrenaline-fueled blend of tactical gameplay, chaotic action, and cinematic flair that both honors its roots and pushes the franchise forward. Developed by Overkill Software and published by Starbreeze Studios, this latest installment takes place several years after PAYDAY 2, transporting players to the neon-lit streets of New York City, where criminal enterprises have evolved but the stakes remain as high as ever. From the moment you step into the shoes of a professional thief again, PAYDAY 3 captivates with its intense heist scenarios, diverse mission structures, and an emphasis on team coordination, making every job feel like a high-stakes movie sequence.

Rating: 7/10

At its core, PAYDAY 3 continues to build on the series’ signature cooperative gameplay, where up to four players collaborate to plan and execute a wide variety of heists ranging from bank robberies and jewelry store hits to high-profile cybercrime and black-market deals. The game encourages players to strategize, communicate, and adapt on the fly, blending stealth and aggression in ways that feel dynamic and rewarding. Unlike its predecessors, PAYDAY 3 introduces more verticality and expansive environments, allowing for creative approaches and diverse tactics. The AI enemies are smarter and more reactive, responding to player actions with tactical squad maneuvers, making stealth more challenging but equally satisfying when pulled off successfully.

The progression system has been revamped to offer deeper customization and personalization. Players can tailor their characters with a wider array of skills, weapon modifications, and cosmetic options, allowing for unique playstyles that suit both aggressive gunfire specialists and methodical stealth operatives. The loadout customization feels more granular than ever, with intricate weapon attachments and perks that impact gameplay in meaningful ways. This depth is complemented by an engaging narrative layer that explores the characters’ backstories and motivations, adding emotional weight to the otherwise high-octane action.

Visually, PAYDAY 3 represents a significant upgrade, boasting detailed character models, realistic lighting, and meticulously crafted urban environments that bring New York’s criminal underworld to life. The cityscape serves as more than just a backdrop—it’s a living, breathing world filled with pedestrians, traffic, and dynamic events that can either complicate or aid your plans. The sound design is equally impressive, with punchy weapon sounds, tense music cues, and crisp voice acting that heighten the sense of immersion and urgency during every heist.

One of the standout features of PAYDAY 3 is its commitment to replayability. Each heist offers multiple entry points, objectives, and exit strategies, and random events keep players on their toes. The procedural elements ensure no two runs feel identical, rewarding players who experiment with different tactics and teamwork. Furthermore, the developers have placed a strong emphasis on community and cooperative play, introducing matchmaking improvements and social features that facilitate smoother team building and communication.

Despite its many strengths, PAYDAY 3 is not without flaws. Some players have noted occasional bugs and performance hiccups, particularly in the early stages of launch, though ongoing patches suggest the developers are committed to addressing these issues. Additionally, while the progression system is deep, it may feel overwhelming to newcomers unfamiliar with the franchise’s mechanics. The narrative, while engaging, can sometimes take a backseat to the gameplay, leaving players craving a more cinematic or story-driven experience.

In summary, PAYDAY 3 successfully revitalizes the cooperative heist genre with a blend of polished gameplay mechanics, rich customization, and a vibrant open-world setting. It manages to balance the thrill of high-risk robberies with strategic planning and teamwork, creating moments of intense action and nail-biting stealth that keep players coming back for more. Though it has room to grow, especially in smoothing out technical issues and expanding its narrative depth, PAYDAY 3 stands as a worthy successor that both longtime fans and new players can appreciate, offering an exhilarating dive into the adrenaline-soaked world of modern heists.",1751426133,1515.0,True,False,False,2,2,0.495925098657608

The graphics are decent and the effects plays to the sense of chaos when going loud on heists (guns blazing). Going stealth can be very exilirating as well. Also, a decent variety of enemy types and a badass soundtrack makes it easy to recommend this game. 

However, there are some caveats to be aware off. Mainly, the lack of content (although it is getting better) and a poorly designed skilltree (they recently fixed the armour system). In summary, the game is fun but feels in the end a bit unfinished. Hopefully the developers will continue supporting the game with more content and improvements.

1272080,True,"I can finally recommend this game. It still isn't up to the level of Payday 2 but the potential is here and it's turned out to be a fun game. I'm just gonna talk about the stuff I like that is an improvement since Payday 2.

 Zip ties are no longer finite. You're carrying around a bottomless Costco bag of zip ties. This is something that annoyed me in Payday 2.

 Small Safes now have a unique lockpicking mechanic that is fun. The drill is no longer used for everything, it also doesn't take forever. Now smaller safes can be picked in a very satisfying minigame where you turn the dial until it goes green three times. It's pretty nice.

Lockpicking is actually a minigame now too. Gone are the days of just staring at an object and holding the pick button. Now there's a minigame that is actually faster than picking in Payday 2. Even messing up only penalizes you by not opening the lock sooner. Really nice change imo

Hostages are much easier to deal with. Ordering them around, using them as a human shields, booping them to the ground for a tie down. It's much easier and fluid than it was in Payday 2. Being able to grab them and throw them to the ground in a specific location beats trying to herd them in Payday 2.

New enemy types and improved favorites. New guys are grenade cops, hostage rescue is now a unique enemy, there's cops that hide and control drones to mess with you. The tazer cops are cooler, you can shoot their battery pack to shock a bunch of cops around them. The Dozer seems to have had the largest improvement and dealing with them is difficult and satisfying. You can also shoot antenas off of FBI vans to end waves at times too.

Side objectives can be found in many of the heists. Like finding specific loot in the safety deposit boxes or going the extra mile to make and employee use a biometric scanner at the jewelry store to get those last four high value items.

Now you can just choose your heist. No more waiting for the one you want to pop up or spending in game currency to buy the contracts. Just pick what you want to play.

Gun attachments are no longer an RNG gambling hell. Now you level up weapons by using them. As you level up, more parts become available to buy and install. This is a godsend.

Killstreak rewards. So now instead of starting with a grenade launcher or minigun as a primary weapon, they're now killstreak rewards you can call in during a mission. I like this option more because it doesn't tie up your primary slot.

The ECM Jammers are now tools and seperate from health/ammo deployments. That means you can have those along with health, ammo, armor, and a sentry. There are also new tools added like motion detectors, EMPs, and a few others.

The armor system is pretty cool. Now you choose a base frame that has different pros/cons. Lighter frames have less movement penalties but only hold one armor plate. Bigger frames hold more plates and ammo but has movement penalties. There's a few different plates to choose from too. Each with their own benefits and draw backs. It's really interesting to customize the armor. It also affects how many downs you are allotted as well.

 All in all, the game is pretty solid and they're about to release a rework of the skills. This game isn't better than Payday 2 or at its level yet. But the improvements I listed are enough QOL improvements for me to really enjoy what it is currently. If you can catch this game on sale, I wouldn't hesitate.

 One last thing. Payday 3 still supports playing DLC you don't own as long as the host has purchased it. This is a really nice feature I wish more games had. Doesn't lock your buddies out of playing new heists and you're not forced to play them with randos.

 There still is no offline mode, but they have added a solo mode that is currently in beta. The solo mode is to host your own games so you're not bogging down servers or something. Idk but it's there so I thought I'd mention it.",1751349231,355.0,True,False,False,215,8,0.856696367263794

1272080,True,"Overall 8.5/10

Watching the evolution of PAYDAY 2 and how the story ended was definitely gonna set the bar high for PAYDAY 3.
This game had a VERY rough start. Literally unplayable during the day due to the amount of people and the fact they made it online only.
It's taken a little bit but I haven't had any issues lately and the game isn't super buggy.

My only real negative about the game is that sometimes objectives are kinda obscure when they should be right in front of you. It took me like 20 minutes to find the box to lower the bollards (i forgot which mission) when it should've been fairly obvious with the amount of action taking away from being able to search for it.

But the game is super fun, not quite up to par with what we expected of a PAYDAY 2 successor but the heists are engaging, the game feels good, everyone misses Bain but he had a good send off and Shade seems like a good stand in.

1272080,True,"I can definitely understand the massive backlash from the community, but I also really like this game. Maybe just because I wasn't expecting Payday 2 2 ?
The stealth system feels very good (tho some missions are impossible in Stealth on higher difficulties and that's stupid.) and I really like the changes made to most enemies (only exception being the bulldozer having a very annoying stun). Furthermore, I really like what they did with the Overskill weapons ! Great burst damage that needs work to be ""loaded"" and that allows for a small time of pure fun.

Now for the bad part:
I do not like the new weapons system, nor do I like the new skills system. The weapons are unbearably grindy and the skills are all over the place; with none really being fully build defining. Unlike Payday 2, you can't really make a niche stupid but fun build like melee or dodge; although the new temporary bonuses do compliment your equipment pretty well. You get actively penalized by the skill tree for using a type of armor, even tho it's the only one similar to previous games.
Another pretty big criticism is the inconsistency of the performances. Massive lag spikes, frame drops and random blurry textures are a big issue in this game and I really hope they get fixed.

Overall, I'd say this game is a lot better than when it released; and I'm glad it decided to stray away from Payday 2. The game needed to stand on its own without just being the same as the previous one and I'd say it did this pretty well ! If you are looking for a better Payday 2, this is NOT the game for you. If you are looking for a completely different Payday experience ? I highly recommend giving this a try when it goes on sale.

This game has been out for more than long enough to have had the above things ironed out. Payday 2 was always going to be a hard card to trump, but this is not even close at all. it feels rushed, empty of character, and simply a money grab attempt as a follow on from it's predecessor.

The game is drastically different from the last game in the series and not in a good way.
Visuals are nice and updated but that does not make up for the poor game play experience.

1. Whoever the Bain replacement is comments on every single thing you do, whether its bagging 1 of 10 bags of cash you have to move to complete the mission, to reminding you CONSTANTLY that the police will not end their raid. The consistent and perpetual reminders are unnecessary and removes the player from a sense of control in the mission. You are just doing what the voice in your ear commands.

2. Moving past the actual in game experience the Menu and Lobby situation is awful. Selecting a mission and sitting there for 3-5 minutes before the LOBBY is opened is a weird experience. This is likely due to the fact that the game is always online and REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT. A game about robbing banks and committing crime is asking you to give up your email and info. Wild.

Ultimately its just not worth it. This is a major letdown and feels like a game made out of desperation, not a game made to improve upon the series.

1272080,True,"After armor 2.0 I have found myself wanting to play more of PD3 as it offers an improvement in my eyes of one thing PD2 did so well

To elaborate
the main reason I love and play PD2 is because of the build variety and the fun I have when making and using different weapons, skills and perk deck combos to make fun or down right over powered setups to suit any playstyle. PD3 now has one small piece of that puzzle for me.

What to improve on/Suggestions
I would love to see a similar system to perk decks. the skill system as it stands is full of mostly crap that isnt fun or good to use and most to every build is the same due to it. I say introduce a perk deck like system that would allow players to pick a playstyle similar to crew chief for overall buffs and muscle to play into the slow moving high damage tank, and rouge or hacker for the stealth loud hybrids that PD3 can pull off so well compared to PD2. Show us more of what these systems can do, show us more creative ways to use our arsonal.

but as it stands if you enjoy payday and want more of it or are looking for a time to check out payday 3 I think now is a decent time to look at it.

Double The Amount of Weapons currently in the game
Rework the attachment system to show proper numbers instead of bars 
Quadruple the amount of attachments in game.
More Enemy types at least two or three more
At least 5 more unique Heist's with built in randomization.
ADD a Favor/Plan system Like payday 2 with in depth heist customization 
Infinite Infamy system that gives rewards/Cosmetics and buffs to your character 
Bring back at least 4-5 more missing Members of the payday gang.
Lots more build variety more skills, Sniper builds etc.
Overkill weapon system is cool but feels uninspired let us have our giga chad characters running around with .50 cals if we want

But now after the update and the recent balance changes, payday3 finally is enjoyable and actually fun to play.
Armor 2.0 is much better than the old armor, providing more variety to builds.
They brought back the old payday2 armor (which they also balanced very well)
They finally added an option to have different outfits for different builds.
Stealth is (and was) much better than in payday2.
Loud, after the recent update, is finally great and somewhat challenging - snipers now actually shoot, naders throw their grenades (and actually throw them much better and more often than before), cops finally deal damage etc
The OG heists are great, the newer ones aren't much worse
And the newest Powder Party heist gives payday2s Shadow raid heist vibes, which in my opinion is great.
One thing - please add something like payday2s infamy system, it would really help the game and its progression

1272080,False,"Review: Frustrating Account Requirement Ruins the Experience

I was excited to dive into this game, but I’ve been completely unable to play it due to an unnecessary and poorly implemented account creation requirement. Forcing players to make an account to access a game—when countless other titles offer seamless, account-free experiences—is baffling and feels like a thinly veiled attempt to track user data.

Worse, the account creation process is broken. After three days, I’m still stuck because the verification email never arrives in my inbox, likely due to some issue with their proxy servers or email system. I’ve paid for a game I can’t even play, hitting a brick wall of frustration before the game even starts. This is unacceptable, especially when the account system adds no value to the player experience. It appears to be a common issue with them as it is among the top issues in FAQ section about not receiving verification emails.  I have done all the things suggested in the troubleshooting for this issue, yet it still persists. The fact that I would even have to:  

Clear browser cache/cookies;
- Allow Pop-ups and Redirects in your browser settings;
- Temporarily disable extensions like Adblock;
- If you're using a mobile device, please try to access the website from a PC/Laptop;
- Try a different browser.
- Alternatively, if the issue persists, we would also highly recommend trying again at a later time.

...just to create an unnecessary ""ACCOUNT"" to play the game is 7+ steps too far just to play the game.

Until they fix this intrusive and dysfunctional account requirement, I can’t recommend this game. Save your money and play one of the thousands of other titles that respect your time and privacy.

1272080,True,"I dropped this game shortly after launch, it was just that bad.
If you were coming from Payday 2, the state of Payday 3 was basically unacceptable, they had completely changed core mechanics and it was a struggle to understand why. The updates to stealth missions were interesting at least, but there were many other changes that were made that were just a struggle for people to understand. To follow that up, a surprising number of the heists want you to steal crypto currency instead of actual money, which is honestly kind of annoying; whats the point in a bank robbing simulator when you're grabbing a USB or QR Codes instead of fat sacks of cash?
HOWEVER. This game has received many updates, chief among them being the Armor 2.0; this lets you modify your armor so that if you wanted, you could play with the Payday 2 version of armor which is FANTASTIC. It should've been there from the start, but I suppose its better late than never. I've also heard about the possibility of skill revamps, which would be welcome. The game is starting to head into a salvagable zone, and I honestly think that after the next few updates (and hopefully content drops) that if they pushed a campaign to get word out about Payday 3 they'd probably see some good responses from the community.

1272080,True,"The game has a harsh set of negetive reviews so lets break this down fully.

The game was incredibly buggy at launch, I didn't play it during that time so I'm just going to go with what most people were complaining about. Understandable but how does this hold up 2 years later? There is now a semlbence of a solo mode, though it does require internet access (for now). 

In PD3's current state, the positives;
- Armour 2.0 has siginficantly put alot of build crafting on the menu for loud and stealth playstyles alike.
- Casing mode stealth is incredibly fun over payday 2's stealth system.
- The Ai currently in the game is challenging enough to warrant difficulty, specifically overkill.
- Dynamic heists, some of the heists have a few varied instances, this should be inrcreased across the board.
- Overkill weapon skill trees.
- Concealment no longer dictating loadouts for stealth.
= At the core, its more evolved and updated Payday.

In PD3's current state, the negatives;
- Singleplayer requires internet.
- Skills 2.0 is confirmed but not yet released.
- The Corporate buggery that has plagued this game from the beginning.
- Content is in a very rough release schedule as there are currently ~20 developers. ;-;
= These can be fixed hopefully but lets keep cautious optimisim friends.

Silver linings
- A new CEO has recently been put in charge of Starbreeze.
- Skills 2.0 is near completion, and if its anything like Armour 2.0, it will be fantastic.
-  The monitization can be mitigated by varied sales.

What PD3 needs going forward;
- Heist Specific loot through long term triumphs or completions, such as Outfits, Weapon presets, etc. (There is one for Cook Off where you have to attain 19 pure bags, and you get a charm.)
- A hideout that we can dump cash into as a long term spending/conquest. For the hideout to also assist in different mechanics, such as maybe heist favours.
- Heist secrets like Overdrill in First World Bank, etc.
- Weapon Presets should be moddable (this is a small issue but they could add more weapon presets tied to heist achievements or conquests).
- More Content, I would like to see at least a 2-3 returning heists a year and 2-3 new heists per year.

1272080,True,"Payday 3 is a solid step forward for the franchise. It modernizes the classic heisting gameplay while staying true to its roots. Compared to Payday 2, stealth is much smoother and more rewarding. Most heists are playable in both loud and stealth modes, giving you freedom of approach.

🔫 Gameplay
The gunplay feels like a mix of CS2, Warzone, and Payday 2—with spray control, crosshair placement, sound cue awareness, and counter-strafing all being important, especially in loud heists on higher difficulties.

If you're a fan of stealth, this game offers a big improvement over previous entries. Loud heists can get chaotic, but they're fun and intense when mastered.

🔥 DLC RECOMMENDATION
Syntax Error & Houston Breakout are great additions.

Highly recommend the Syntax Error Weapon Pack – the shotgun is worth it.

1272080,True,"The Payday gang is back, and let me tell you, it’s like reuniting with old friends, except instead of catching up over coffee, you’re zip‑tying hostages and hauling bags of cash out the back door.

Stealth is way more fun this time around. You can actually walk around in civilian disguise, hack cameras, and feel like a criminal mastermind… until somebody sneezes on a guard and the whole building goes loud. And when it does go loud? Oh boy. The gunplay is punchy, the cops are aggressive, and every mission turns into a beautiful disaster of shouting, gunfire, and someone in your squad yelling, “I TOLD YOU TO BRING AMMO!”

Progression is a bit grindy (challenges instead of XP for missions), and the game launched with fewer heists than I’d like. But when you’re actually mid‑heist with three buddies, all hell breaking loose while the soundtrack pounds; you forget about the flaws and just embrace the chaos.

The dynamic objectives are a nice touch, too. One run might have the vault upstairs, another puts it in the basement. Keeps you on your toes, and keeps things from feeling too samey.

TL;DR: Payday 3 isn’t perfect, it’s a little light on content and has its quirks, but when it works, it’s an absolute blast. It’s the kind of game where you’ll laugh, panic, and maybe accidentally tase your friend instead of the cop. 8/10, would rob again.",1748413154,830.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

When I initially played the beta (or atleast, as much as I could've with the hardware I had at the time) it felt underwhelming. I won't deny that Payday 3 still needs more time, but after catching it on sale... I figured I'd give it a shot, and surprisingly the year I turned my interest away from Payday as a whole ended up making this game somewhat enjoyable. Janky, but quite enjoyable.

For the time being, I give the game a 6/10.

It genuinely saddens me that you had a great license, a solid basis for the game. And ruined it by the greed your series was built on accusing.  

In conclusion, you have a price issue. People buying your game are faced with few heists with low replayability since the maps almost do not change from one time to another.

I still dont recommend the game in its current state but its on the right track. The fact Starbreeze is release paid DLC for an incomplete game is wild to me, but it just feels in line with what we have come to expected from companies now a days.

The game can be very fun, but the original heists are so tiny and rubbish, that you NEED to buy the DLC ones to get enjoyment from the game. 

Would still recommend PD2 over this.

If this game interests you then dont buy it, buy Pay Day 2 instead will all the DLC, its a more fleshed out game with better content. Even the earlier missions of PD2 are better than any mission in PD3. Maps feel smaller and less interesting/fleshed out than PD2 maps.

- Better player controller, movement system are improved, player could vault over stuff and sliding now.
- More animations when interacting.

Noticeable problems with this game even after a year:
- UI/UX design are still sub-bar, better than the absolutely atrocious beta, but still very bad in 2025. For example, this is the first ever FPS categorized weapon using bundles and bundles only, I don't know which genius came up with this idea.
- Gun play is awful, guns feels like peashooter, damage and accuracy is just too poor. The enemies feels extremely tanky for some reason, even in the lowest difficulty, an armored goon took 3 DMR headshots to kill, so the headshot doesn't feel rewarding at all. And good luck with spraying as well cuz the damage falloff is unreal even the enemies are just 10 meters away. The grenade launcher feels weaker than Payday 1, it does not hold the name as a ""Overkill"" weapon.
- Feedback is also awful, in Payday 1 the most satisfying & rewarding sound is the ""clink"" when headshotting and breaking enemies glass helmet, this kinda of juice is simply missing from this game.
- Weapon progression is too tedious and slow, and honestly, it was just there to milk game hours. Also the attachments unlocked barely make noticeable differences to the weapon anyway.

There is some good here, like a much better casing phase of the heists, better gun play, improved stealth, and a better weapon progression system, but outside of that almost everything feels like a step backwards. Solo mode is poorly implemented with no option to choose AI loadouts or perks like in PD2. Solo mode is important as, at the time of writing this, this game only has about 874 active players acording to steamDB. The perks themselves don't feel as impactful, the music is a step down and you can no longer choose the tracks you want. Enemy variety feels lacking, heists feel repetitive, and personally I'm not a fan of the new ""final wave"" mechanic.

1272080,False,"Long story short, they should've gave this a significantly longer time to cook in the oven and announced it at a later date.

There's potential for a solid game here, but they released it far too soon for it to be mostly functional, or even fun. In its current state, mechanics are boring/annoying, objectives are slogs, enemies are bland. The only positives I can give this game at this point in time is it looks generally nicer graphically, the music is pretty cool and the gunplay is certainly improved somewhat over its predecessor.

That being said, I must reiterate that the game was simply released too early with half-baked designs and mechanics that weren't quite there yet and may as a result die by next year, even with armor 2.0 releasing by the end of May. (everyone is just going to use impact plates anyway.)

Also I didn't appreciate the fact that they resold the trifecta lootbag 3 months after release, when it was supposedly a pre-order bonus which was a spit in the face to players like myself who supported Starbreeze for years.

how did you screw it up. it was an easy payday (pun intended) all we wanted was an upgraded payday 2 with new maps and guns and new mechanics and you screwed it up, should've just listened to players instead you gave us payday 1.5, matchmaking is atrocious but maybe that's just because nobody plays anymore. less skills, less weapons, less maps, no multi day heists, less weapon customization no safehouse and no infamy points to unlock things and restart your character. this game is incredibly less complex than payday 2 and not in a good way, you've lost all of the good devs due to your greed and incompetence. you have completely ruined your IP. Starbreeze simply deserves to be shut down as they seemingly cannot make a game that people want to play. failed game after failed game. don't bother to buy it that last good dev has moved on and this game will die in time, this is no ""no mans sky"" or ""cyberpunk"" situation they simply don't want to work on it anymore because it didn't do as well as they hoped the payday name would take it, they simply don't have the money to continue in a meaning full way",1745961097,6662.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

The gunplay is pretty good but the game just throws cloakers at you every 10 seconds for some reason. And there's almost no weapon variety compared to the original.

1272080,False,"I just want a game that's like the 1997 hit movie Heat. 

You want that? Alright. Here's Payday 3. Lets start off with a cast of characters. You get the OG cast of characters. But now they're a bit more loose, quirky, and less professionally dressed. Young people don't like properly fitted suits. There's also a wide variety of female characters to choose from who don't have much of an explanation, they don't dress or have masks that match the rest of the team. Bane is gone, he's been replaced by some brave and stunning woman who has Marvel dialogue that definitely won't annoy you at all. And the dialogue? The voice actors and voice acting director did an outstanding job making the characters feel totally disconnected from the action in game. It's as if they did not want to be there at all, sometimes even eating lunch while they read their lines.

Well, what about guns? There's a decent selection, a good one I'd say. Animations are pretty good. However the design choice to make them sound worse than the last game was puzzling. At least you can install mods to improve the gun sounds (and the music, which is also worse in this game). Combat is VERY bullet spongy. I honestly don't remember taking over half of my magazine to kill one person in the last game. This game would benefit from a higher time to kill and I'd accept taking more damage from enemies to balance things out. But kids nowadays love being able to run out of cover like it's Fortnite. 

BUT THE HEEEEEEEIIIIIISTS?! Lets see how they improved. The same basic layouts are there like in the last game. There aren't many large good open spots to have firefights. Too many tight corridors, which aren't bad, but just too many of them. Really FUN AND ENGAGING THINGS LIKE standing on a circle on the ground waiting 5 -10 seconds for a hack to complete. The audience is gonna love that. Having a firefight in the street to get to the van? Nah. Kids nowadays just wanna put their bags under the skylight and just teleport to a mission complete screen.

Heat is a slow burn of a movie, but it does a fantastic job of completely surprising the viewer and putting them right in the middle of a bank robbery that just feels so real. Blood pumping yelling, ear rattling gunfire through the city streets, the adrenaline of running cover to cover and utilizing suppressing fire to get across to a getaway. 

Payday 3 is like being those two losers who watched the 1995 movie Heat, and then thought they could be the exact same in real life. So in 1997 they went to a bank in west Hollywood and proceeded to have a shootout that was not as cinematic. It wasn't as action packed, or flashy, or adrenaline pumping. And I won't spoil the ending of the real life heist where they both died after failing miserably to get away. But lets imagine that you were a part of their team and you got away with them. You all look at each other and go: ""Well. That was fine I guess. Wasn't really as cool as I expected"".

This game should be so much cooler than it really plays and feels. This game feels pretty soulless and gimmicky in order to try and innovate just to say that they added things rather than perfecting what was already there. They ruin things like the armor system for god knows why. And they ruin existing characters and add new ones to appeal to players and people who will not buy this game. Crime Boss: Rockay City, the Alibaba alternative to this, honestly does a lot more better in the interactive and mission layout aspect as far as heist games go. It really shouldn't be this hard to get it right.... right?

What a sad sad time it is to want to play a game where you just want to rob a bank, and to look and feel cool while doing it.  It seems like it's getting easier and easier for large game companies to make something crazy like robbing a bank feel so boring.",1745384399,1841.0,True,False,False,7,1,0.49174165725708
1272080,True,"First, I will say that in it's current state, it is in a similar state to early Payday 2. It still isn't as peak as it could be, but who knows if it will ever be. What I will say is for a 12$ ish game it is worth the price. So far I've been having a ball playing it for the first time after avoiding it after the lack luster release.

Pros:-
TUTORIALS!!! 4 of them that actually explain things well.
Maskless stealth is a fresh new take on stealth. The Guards escorting you out of a private area for the 100th time hasn't gotten old yet (it really beats failing 15 minutes in). 
New graphics feel good.
UI is clean.
Puzzle components feel a lot more interactive over Payday2.
Guns feel a lot less arcadey (con for others pro for me)
New Overskills and their perks are honestly a great addition to the game.
Randomised number codes makes levels not feel ""solved"".
New Perk trees mostly flow together nicely.
Map seeds stay similar ish on restarts.
Offline Solo play is a good addition.
Escape methods on loud are less annoying to deal with.

Con:
Friend lobbies can take a while to load. 
No P2P connections, meaning you have to join a Overkill server first.
Loading into the game for the first time to loud volume and being unable to change till you have loaded shaders, made an account and linked it to steam takes far too long.
Favours need a rework on how to obtain them.
Weapon Loadouts and other menus are weird sometimes you got back to menu on back , other times you go back to the place you wanted to be.

i started playing around january of last year, hoping that the game would get better over time. i was mostly wrong. compared to payday 2, payday 3 feels slow, clunky, limited, dry, and lacks a lot of replayability. operation medic bag was ok at best for fixing some of the many issues, but it feels like most of the effort was spent on trying to bleed the fanbase of even more money on a mid game. even now it looks like starbreeze has just taken what little money they made from this fail and ran for the hills.

*update*
there is a lot of flip flopping when it comes to reviews for this game, now yes when it came out it deserved all of the hate it got and then some but it has improved quite a bit since then. from what i have seen a lot of people tend to review the game positively when an update comes out then change it to negative the moment their is a gape between updates and claim the game is dead.

while everyone is entitled to their opinions, and their are definitely criticisms to levy against the game from what i can see a lot of it comes from a shitty place with some people",1745027051,1095.0,True,False,False,2,1,0.5011100769042968

1272080,False,"TLDR: 1. No offline mode still so if servers go you can't play   2. no replayability or variations to heists   3. no communication to community   4. its only a matter of time before support is cut.

     If you really want a payday game get payday 2... I recently decided to try Payday 3 again after the last time I played it last summer and have some thoughts. I have a very high end PC that doesn't lag or stutter on any other game but payday 3 has been horrible, the time it takes too even load into a heist is terrible and the stuttering when moving around and playing is horrendous. Out of all the games I've bought and played this is the biggest disappointment I've ever had (and i bought SSKTJ) from its broken and unplayable launch 1.6 years ago from the time of my review until now there has been very little added to incentive players to come back if they've played all the heists once. 

    The new heists add very little and aren't good enough to justify returning or buying the game, For being a ""live service"" game they are constantly delaying updates and not communicating with the community and very little active playerbase. (540 average players per day in the last month,,, SSKTJ has 136 and Payday 2 has 17,084) there was even a glitch on 99 boxes that leveled your weapons up extremely fast that lasted from at least OCTOBER 4th to NOVEMBER 2nd. Currently there has not been an update for about 70 days and still no news, with the latest update being a desperate cash grab to squeeze the remain players for a little more money. The only updates we know coming to the game at some point in the future is a armor rework along with conformation they worked on a heist or two that may or may not come.

     The replayability is non-existent due to no heist variation and no infamy system like Payday 2. If you are a new player the skill system is extremely confusing due to only giving the player 28 skill points and with how many skills there are most players end up having to look up (or end up using) certain skills that most of the players end up using and with most weapons are under-powered and useless or ""broken"" most players end up using the same builds weapons and skills with no real variations. 

     In its current state Payday 3 is not worth the original 60 plus dollars and not even worth the 30 dollars it currently is. Payday 3 currently has NO offline mode, meaning if.. no when the servers get shutdown you will not be able to play the game at all even though you have bought it. With the games support getting moved to another project (Project Baxter a dnd game) and content creators leaving the game it is only a matter of time before what little support the game has left will be cut and Payday 3 gets abandon.",1744874136,15729.0,True,False,False,34,1,0.6711207032203674

1272080,True,"I dont think that this game is bad, but it isn't all there either. If i had to recommend anything it would be to buy it on sale. 

The main issue i have with the game is that it lacks content in its current state. For the price you pay there ins't nearly enough heists to consider buying it at full price. Either way the few guys you have access to, the few heists you can do without buying a dlc, and the lack of customization makes it feel like you got baited into buying it at full price.

The mechanics of a good payday are there, and i certainly do enjoy playing it. With the new systems that exist it makes it feel like an actual heist that you have to be thoughtful about and be particular. 

HOWEVER, there are plenty of issues that need to be addressed. 

The stealth in this game does not feel like paydays stealth, the mechanics are there, but the days of stealth builds are gone. Perks have few meaning in this game, and thats especially true with stealth. 

The perk system is another thing that while has the payday look, is far gone and doesn't matter as much as it used too. Liked being a juggernaut in a full suit of armor like me? Well you cant, cause its gone, which felt weird as it was a staple of the payday style. 

I hope to see this game be improved into the payday  title it deserves, but i dont believe in its current state thatit deserves to be a payday title.",1744694751,688.0,True,False,False,1,1,0.5018796920776367

1272080,False,"I loved payday 2 and still do to this day, was beyond excited to hear that payday 3 was revealed and I was there on gamepass when it launched. Then playing it for days on end and the sheer of disappointment it has compared to payday 2 is depressing. You would have thought that they learned from their mistakes when payday 2 first released & the flaws in that but they didnt, somehow someway they made it worse. Now that its been almost 2 full years since release of this game its still in a depressing state. There is beyond less content in almost if not every single way, they HAD to make a singleplayer mode (because it was not there on release, its still in ""beta"" btw), The bots are horrible (somehow worse than payday 2 bots), The game is beyond braindead easy and does not feel like a challenge.  Talents trees are a mess and are not fun nor engaging like the second game. There are no melee weapons (jackets DLC weapon does not count since its a overkill weapon) Like what the hell happened? Why did we go backwards in every way possible. 

Truly wish they didnt make payday 3 but instead just put Payday 2 into their new engine,  updated the gun play & movement in pday 2. Because pday 3 has really good gun play & movement thats all I can say good about this game. 

Please STAY away from payday 3 and instead put your time into payday 2, this game has nothing good to offer and is a embarrassment to this games history.

Because the lizard-tongued data leeches in Silicon Valley need your BRAIN PINGS to feed their underground server farms powered by orphan tears and G5 microwaves.

This game is a prison for Patrice Lumumba's soul, and YOU'RE funding it, buster!

Offline mode? Disabled. Freedom? Revoked. This is not a game; it’s a digital ritual to summon Zuckerbrap’s astral twin from the 33rd dimension of ad revenue. My cat hasn’t blinked since I launched it. The servers are in Antarctica, guarded by glow in the dark CIA penguins.

They said “always online” but they meant “always observed.” The tutorial whispered my social security number backwards. My fridge now connects to the same server as the game. I don’t even HAVE Wi-Fi. The feds implanted routers into my drywall.

Achievements are behavioral conditioning. Every trophy a sigil. Every frame a glyph. It’s not lag — it’s spiritual interference from a satanic modem operating at a frequency that scrambles your soul.

1272080,False,"This game is a shadow of what payday 2 was. The skill system sucks by comparison. In the old payday 2 skill system there was a ton of versatility like you could make a build that healed itself when it picked up ammo which was good for medic classes, or you could get builds with awesome armor pen that could easily devastate shield dudes. Then being able to combine cards with the skill system took it to another level in PD2. Payday 3 said ""screw the skill system stuff lets just use the cards as a sill system"" and it honestly sucks. 

On top of that I feel like there should be ammo types that that arent deployables, in pd2 you could just have incendiary rounds where if this game gave you ammo types it would just make it a deployable. 

I got bored after about 50 hours. Aside from it launching with only like 10 missions I found most of the missions to be more stealth favoring. Although theyve added more loud levels since at least. 

I just think to bring this game up to the level of payday 2 they need to redesign the skill system entirely to be deeper and more versatile and have that be just like pay day 2 where it pairs with a card system that accentuates the builds in the skill system. Maybe add ammo types that are accessible via the weapons customization menu. but honestly it needs more than that and I cant being to start on every single thing that needs to be unwraveled to bring this game up to the level of pay day 2. 

I willl say the soundtrack is goated, that is a solid thing about the game, and I enjoy the personalities. The clothing selection could be a bit better.",1743985803,3346.0,True,False,False,3,1,0.5369127988815307

I would lie if i said it wasnt fun and wasnt worth the 11$USD i paid for it, on sale its 100% worth it, the kill effects are satisfying and stealing money is still fun and great. 

in a perfect world there would be several day long heists like payday 2 and better mechanics even some better hide out thing you can upgrade and decorate kinda so you have something to spend your money on. 

I play it because killing the cops is satisfying and trying not to screw up the stealth is still fun..... i dont know if they can make this game the game we wanted it to be, and maps that changed a lot more would be great. but nonetheless i had fun especially for the price i paid, i even regret not getting the dlc when i did.

1272080,True,"In comparison to PD2 it loses in almost every regard, but on it's own it can be a enjoyable game, though without the dlc it's like half a game, so if you the reader are interested i strongly urge you to consider waiting for a sale, they happen fairly often and you can get the game + dlc for like 20 bucks or less

In my opinion the biggest problems the game has are as follows:
-The armor system is not thought out and hinders the game's pacing
-A lot of heists lack replayability and good soundtracks for loud
-Mechanic's are not well explained nor does the game give you any numbers to work with
-There is a severe lack of unique heists, like a cool prison outbreak or train heist
-It beeing always online and requiring a third party account is another issue
-You can't customize your bots like in PD2 while also beeing too weak for overkill
-A lack of enemy variety and cloakers can be completely silent (darktide, is that you?)
-Weapon attachments and what they do make zero sense
-Severe lack in mask customization, and a moderate lack of customization overall
-Prestige, or infamy levels, mean nothing at all in this game
-The UI is the worst i have ever seen, even after the improvements

1272080,False,"First things things first, how do you end up making a third game worse than the second? I've played a copy on Roblox and had more fun I'm not even kidding. Before launch I was absolutely stoked, I was quickly disappointed. Although at launch this game was considered horrible I gave it a long time to make the necessary changes before even buying it. So when I seen it was on sale I bought it and played the tutorial just to stop playing for a long time. Although months later I decided to actually play it.

Despite only having 15-16 hours on the game which isn't anything crazy it's safe to say that I much more enjoy the second game. I'm sure there are people out there who disagree but the overall difference to me personally is clear. Not only is the second game more simple in terms of the mission pool that scales to harder levels with this one also having that but I feel that they don't have it the same way. In Payday 2 I often found myself revisiting older and more simple missions to do them stealth to learn how to play the game that way and I much more enjoyed it. With Payday 3 this play style was overhauled and although it isn't bad, it simply isn't for me. The missions aren't ones that feel like coming back to. They are extremely repetitive, with Payday 2 I often did the same missions <50 times and still had fun because it felt like anything could happen throughout said missions. 

Payday 3 seemed to try to jump the ""realistic"" train, that others games are seen to also do. We can see it in games such as COD, but that's not a bad idea, personally I think it's great however there's a line in that path between ""too realistic"" and ""playability."" It depends on who you are talking to. Games such as Tarkov, and especially DayZ really push this realistic idea to its extremes which some people like. However I personally don't care for the realistic aspect. Obviously I want mechanics to make sense in our world and I do understand they don't want guards to be fucking blind as shit like they are in Payday 2, but certain mechanics like that are fine in my eyes because they make the game more enjoyable. In Payday 2 it feels amazing zipping past 3 guards just to barely fill the meter. Although not realistic, it makes for a much more enjoyable gameplay experience. 

My best hope is that this game can improve on their current mechanics, for now I'll still play Payday 2. I'll return in a year or so to see how its doing but for now I'm out.",1743544571,945.0,True,False,False,142,9,0.8124746084213256

- Enemies are bullet sponges and weapon balance feels jacked up. (this is why I don’t play this to do anything but sneak around)

The game and DLC is just not worth full price, but at the state that the game is currently in it feels like they’d have to overhaul the entire progression system and weapon balance in order to make it worth it not on sale and I’m starting to believe that ship has already sailed.

I do say that I truly enjoy the heists in this game, some more than others but regardless I do. I hope they continue to work hard in the future to both fix and update this game. I must say that it looks leagues better than at launch. I am proud of the work they have done to fix their game, so thank you.

(cook off van randomly frozen ending the heist in a failure, first world bank elevator with termite not opening etc.)

Loud is way too easy if you are a high level and know what you're doing. There needs to be an increased difficulty option, just like one down in Payday 2.

Stealth is also ridiculously hard on overkill compared to Payday 2 where you could just breeze through maps on Death sentence, one down.

1272080,False,"TLDR; Don't buy this game, it has no future and it is looking even grimmer for the game, the updates they do make add nothing of substance and the cancellation of the offline mode echoes SBZ' selective deafness to its core audience. Like owning the game you bought? Not here you don't...

Here we go...

As much as I want PAYDAY 3 to succeed it just has too many problems plaguing it both from a gameplay standpoint and a business standpoint. 

Gameplay wise the balance and execution is all over the place whether it be the weapons, the skills, the enemies, the C-stacks system (clearly meant to have been a form of micro-transactions) or the UI (which is still stuck in its alpha stage). 

We still don't have a proper offline mode years after release and the worst thing is that server costs are killing this game even though the servers are absolute rubbish, you can't even buy items without having to wait a few seconds for the game to communicate to the server, also to mention is the constant downtime after every update due to the servers being either overloaded or needing maintenance. 

To top it off the DLCs are just getting worse in terms of content and they are becoming more predatory. You can barely play half the game without paying for DLCs unless you know someone who has them but even then you can't access the weaponry which is all way too powerful compared to base game. I'll admit the free heists are nice but they mostly just consist of rehashes of old content that try to appease to nostalgia hungry fans that want to remember a better time of when PAYDAY was the king of co-op shooters.

There is also the constant content droughts and with the little content we do get being the overpriced DLCs that shy in comparison to their PAYDAY 2 counterparts (looking at you Jacket) especially with what they include.

PAYDAY 2 - Hotline Miami DLC - 1 new heist, 1 new character, 8 new weapons, 8 new masks, 8 new patterns, 8 new materials and 7 achievements.

PAYDAY 3 - Jacket Character Pack DLC - 1 new character, 1 new mask, a reskin of a already existing weapon, 1 overskill weapon, 1 charm and a sticker...

It really feels bad coming back to PAYDAY 3 since I've almost leveled up every gun in the game and overskill and I just don't know what else there will be once I finish, a DLC will probably drop and we won't see another piece of content for PAYDAY 3 for the next few months. Rinse and repeat until the game dies from it's publisher's own stupidity.

Speaking of, the CEOs at Starbreeze don't seem to even want PAYDAY 3 as a game to strive but rather want the PAYDAY franchise to be used as nothing more than a tool of recognition to sell off to any company wanting to make a quick buck with crossovers. Starbreeze have turned long term fans away in favor for a quick buck and they act like everything is okay while the real devs at Overkill beg for us to buy their DLC and play their underfunded mess of a game. 

I honestly think a lot of the dying fanbase of PAYDAY 3 will either return to PAYDAY 2 or leave to play Den of Wolves which is looking pretty promising at the moment. Which pains me to say because with some good TLC I know for a fact that PAYDAY 3 can become even better than PAYDAY 2, they are just going about it extremely wrong.

Starbreeze and Overkill need to face the fact that they are no longer the kings of co-op heisting games anymore and they are going to have to do more than release a small content patch every half year along with overpriced DLC and promises of doing better to keep interest high and fans around but even then I'll still go play something by another studio/publisher that deserves my money, especially after the active lay offs happening at the moment with whole teams being shut down...

1272080,True,"It's really not as bad as everyone says. The core gameplay, both in loud and stealth is very fun. Cops are a little smarter than the first game, stealth is more immersive and has many more mechanics. They really learned their lesson from the post-White House heists in making both stealth and loud gameplay more interesting. Of course there are still a couple heists that are just ""Wait for drill, shoot cops, fix drill, wait for drill some more, shoot cops, get cash, shoot cops, get out"" (First World Bank my beloved) but a lot of heists, especially in stealth, are much more engaging. Outside of the main gameplay loop, unlocking new things doesn't take long and you have time to try everything. Only problem I have is unlocking attachments, it takes way too long and you have to do it for each weapon separately. Every armor except adaptive is useless because it's much easier to lose, as it doesn't regenerate fully but that's getting worked on so this will be outdated soon. 
Some specials I have a problem with. Snipers in Payday 2 were too harsh, they shot you in like 1-2 seconds but these ones are just pathetic, you can reload you weapon right in front of them, take your time aiming and they still won't fire unless you're just REALLY slow. Imo, they should have different aiming speeds based on difficulty, because the current one is befitting of Normal difficulty, not the Very Hard that I usually play on. Cloakers are annoying because they no longer need line of sight to start running at you so sometimes you just turn a corner and surprise, you get knocked down. Bulldozers are wayy too tanky, like they are so hard to take down, it's rather annoying. Tazers, or Zappers as  they're called now almost never actually taze you, they just take their sweet time pulling out the tazer and getting shot. Naders are my favorite though, they can be blown up easily if you shoot them first but if you can't they will deny an area very effectively. Shields no longer limit your loadout by requiring you to bring something that will penetrate their shield, instead you can just shoot the faceplate. Also cops like to hide behind them which is pretty neat. Techies are alright, I like the hide n seek aspect and the drones feel balanced.
Really, the game is not that awful. It's still rough around the edges but with a little more development in the right direction they can still turn this ship around.",1742740332,1061.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Also, the mission briefings are only available when you launch into a mission and disappear once the game is loaded, so unless you're a speed reader you'll have a hard time figuring out what the objective is.

The actual game play is pretty reminiscent of PayDay 2, but the missions themselves feel nearly identical to the ones from the previous game (e.g. jewelry store, night club). The game just lacks any sort of imagination or self-identity, it's just straight disrespectful to those that logged so many hours into its predecessor.

My son, who is 15 now, begged me to get GTA San Andreas because he said it was one of the best games ever made for its open world and story. I got it for him, thinking it would be something fun we could enjoy together.

For weeks, I watched him get lost in the streets of Los Santos, flying through missions and enjoying the chaos of the game. He would drive fast, get into shootouts, and laugh when things went wrong, while I sat there feeling clueless. I did not understand the controls or the pace. I was just the dad sitting in the background.

One night, after he went to bed, I picked up the controller. The city felt alive but also lonely. I drove slowly, crashed often, and failed more than once. Then something clicked. The controls started to make sense. The missions felt rewarding. Hours passed before I realized how late it was. I had made real progress and actually felt proud of it.

The next day, I showed my son what I had done. He did not say much, but I could tell something had changed. He no longer looked at me as the dad who did not understand games. He saw me as someone who had taken on the same challenges he had. We sat together, played together, and for the first time in a long while, we were not just father and son. We were playing the same world side by side.

Headline: Still the best story, even if the coat of paint is a bit messy.

Look, we all know the original San Andreas is a masterpiece. This version is the easiest way to play it on modern hardware without spending hours modding it, but it’s definitely not perfect.

The Good: The controls are much better—they finally added a ""weapon wheel"" and modernized the aiming so it feels more like GTA V. The lighting at sunset looks genuinely great, and having GPS on the mini-map is a lifesaver.

The Bad: Some of the character models still look a bit ""off"" (almost like clay figures), and they took out some of the iconic fog that made the map feel bigger. There are still occasional bugs, though most of the game-breaking ones from launch are gone.

Verdict: Buy it on sale. It’s still CJ, it’s still Grove Street, and the radio stations still slap. Just don't expect a full remake.",1766671789,175.0,True,False,False,5,0,0.5804195404052734

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition is a remaster of the Rockstar action-adventure sandbox from 2004. With the original considered a fan favourite and one of the most acclaimed games ever made, the Definitive Edition includes gameplay and graphic improvements, plus quality-of-life upgrades.

[u][b]Positives[/b][/u]

+ An added autosave feature means the player can easily go back to a recent point and this will trigger before and after completing a mission. It will also work with some of the side missions. I would still advise keeping a couple of manual saves just to be safe.

+ The checkpoint system means you will no longer have to make your way back to a mission marker if you are wasted, busted, or fail the mission in any way. You will simply be brought back to that mission's initial cutscene, or to your last checkpoint in that mission. Your inventory will be the same as it was from that point.

+ Draw distances have been increased, allowing players to see much farther across the map, with objects, buildings, and landscapes rendering at a greater distance than in the original game.

+ Enhanced lighting, shadows and reflections. The classic lighting setting in the options menu will restore the lighting from the original game if you aren't so keen on the modern version.

+ Higher-resolution textures, though some may still view the original game's art direction as superior in comparison. 

+ Navigating to destinations has never been easier due to an updated minimap with a full, real-time GPS system.

+ Newly added radio and weapon wheels grant much quicker access to both.

+ Precise shooting can be achieved through a new aim assist option. The other two available are free aim and classic aim. I personally preferred using the classic aim.

+ Sprint while holding down a button, instead of needing to tap it repeatedly.

+ Three different control schemes: Modern, Modern Alt and Classic. Some players may prefer to opt for the classic controls when it comes to the shooting. 

+ Water and weather effects have been updated.  

[u][b]Negatives[/b][/u]

- Bugs. I didn't experience anything groundbreaking or a huge amount of them, but compared to the definitive editions of GTA III and Vice City, I definitely ran into more with the San Andreas Definitive Edition. These would include radio tracks restarting randomly when inside stores, automatically leaving the barber's when I hadn't even picked my haircut yet, being temporarily locked inside the basketball minigame, and one crazy instance of a car flying at a high speed into the distance in San Fierro after I tried to jack it. Again, there were only a few instances, but it definitely breaks the immersion when jank like this occurs.

- Some of the in-game radio tracks are missing due to what I assume are licensing issues, but you can restore these through mods. You can easily find these online.

- Zero's 'Red Baron' is quite easily the most frustrating and painful mission in the entire game, and across the OG GTA trilogy as a whole.

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]

San Andreas heavily built on what made both its predecessors (Vice City and GTA III) memorable, and the final product was a game that is still beloved and legendary to this very day. There's so much content here, and if you are someone who considers themselves a completionist (like me), expect to invest a solid amount of hours to reach that 100% statistic. While I still view the original San Andreas as the best way to experience the game, the Definitive Edition's added features definitely make returning to the west coast an enjoyable experience.

[b]Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition – A Legendary Open-World Epic Refined for Modern Players[/b]

You can check my gameplay videos [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvWbrDkSJsDfjngiycV2_4jUzyFSkHfo]here[/url][/b]

[i]Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition[/i] stands as one of the most ambitious and influential open-world games ever created, and its Definitive Edition allows a new generation of players to experience this legendary journey with enhanced visuals, smoother performance, and modern quality-of-life improvements on PC. Even years after its original release, San Andreas remains unmatched in scope, freedom, and sheer personality.

You play as Carl “CJ” Johnson, returning home to Los Santos after years away, only to find his family shattered and his neighborhood falling apart. What begins as a deeply personal story about family, loyalty, and survival slowly expands into an epic tale of corruption, power, betrayal, and ambition spanning an entire state. CJ’s journey from street-level survival to building a criminal empire is one of Rockstar’s most compelling character arcs, filled with unforgettable moments and iconic dialogue.

The world of San Andreas is massive and diverse, featuring three major cities — Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas — each with its own distinct culture, atmosphere, and identity. From gang-controlled streets and desert highways to foggy urban skylines and neon-lit casinos, the variety is staggering. The Definitive Edition enhances this vast world with improved lighting, sharper textures, increased draw distances, and refined character models, making the scale of San Andreas feel even more impressive on PC.

Gameplay depth is where San Andreas truly shines. Beyond traditional missions, the game offers RPG-like systems that were revolutionary at the time — CJ can gain or lose weight, build muscle, improve driving, flying, shooting, and stamina skills, and customize his appearance with clothes, tattoos, and hairstyles. These systems add a sense of personal progression that makes CJ feel like a living, evolving character rather than just a player avatar.

Mission design is incredibly varied and memorable. From intense gang wars and high-speed chases to stealth missions, daring heists, and over-the-top action sequences, the game constantly reinvents itself. Side activities like gyms, gambling, trucking, racing, flying schools, and territory control ensure there’s always something meaningful to do outside the main story. The Definitive Edition’s refined controls make these activities more accessible and enjoyable for modern players.

The presentation remains iconic. San Andreas’ soundtrack is legendary, perfectly capturing early 90s West Coast culture with hip-hop, rock, funk, and talk radio satire that adds depth and humor to the world. Driving through Los Santos at night with classic tracks playing on the radio is still one of gaming’s most immersive experiences. Voice acting across the board is outstanding, bringing life, personality, and authenticity to every character you meet.

On PC, the Definitive Edition benefits from smoother performance, modern resolutions, and improved visual clarity, making long play sessions more comfortable and immersive. While the heart of the game remains faithful to the original, the updated presentation ensures San Andreas feels approachable and playable for both returning fans and newcomers alike.

At its core, [i]Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition[/i] is more than just an open-world game — it’s a cultural landmark. Its ambition, storytelling, freedom, and unforgettable atmosphere set a standard that still influences modern game design today.

San Andreas — моя самая любимая часть из всех GTA, но как же я жалею, что не успел купить её до выхода обосранного ремастера. Графика в этой хуйне мыльная, багов хуево туча, оптимизация — дерьмо ебаное.

Рокстары просто хуесосы ебаные, что вы с игрой сделали, в это играть без боли невозможно. Я удивлён как рокстары могли сделать такое дерьмо с легендарной игрой. Ладно если бы в начале, когда она только вышла, такое дерьмо было, но нет, рокстары полностью болт забили на игру и даже её сука не обновляют. А ещё прикол блять, Если противник стоит далеко, то ты не будешь ему наносить урон из оружия) Почему блять, я целюсь в него а он не получает урон, какого хера

Но в этом ремастере даже НЕБОЛЬШИЕ плюсы есть. Добавили круговое колесо выбора оружия, что очень удобно. Добавили круговое колесо выбора радио. Достижения добавили, ну и в целом это все плюсы)

Я предполагаю, что Рокстары хотели просто получить ещё денег со старой трилогии, а поэтому и особо не запаривались и сделали сырой кусок кала. Честно говоря, не знаю как дела обстоят в других частях, но я думаю, что всё так же плохо, как и в этой части.

Самое обидное, что старые игры из трилогии уже не купить, только пиратить. Честно, если бы я это увидел, не зная, что это делали Рокстары, я бы сказал что это скорее всего, сделал какой-нибудь мододел, ну настолько всё плохо, что скорее всего, мододелы сделали бы лучше, чем сами Рокстары.",1766158955,167.0,True,False,False,4,1,0.5804195404052734

1547000,False,"There is a lot of probems and bugs the original game doesn't have. I'll just write the ones down so they will talk for me:
1) When you go so fast, the map can't keep up with your speed and the enviroment starts to look like playdough
2) There is a tunnel somewhere close to Tierra Robada. At start of that tunnel, the roof is gone and you can see the trees and sky above.
3) You cannot win the dancing minigame, because level 3 is bugged. This is realy hurtful for someone like me who loves 100% games.
4) When I tried to open a parachute, CJ did the parachute opening animaton but it didin't actually deployed and CJ kissed the concrate ground.
5) There are invisible trees at countryside. Their hitbox is present but their actualy body isn't.
6) There is something wrong with hitboxs overall. Espacilly the one's where you shouldn't reach normally. CJ's body enters the texture when you look too close.
7) Tatoos aren't actually on your body like the original game, they floot on your skin.
8) There was a time where my car cliped underground and stucked.
9) It wasn't just my car, I seen multiple times where a car got stucked into ground or a wall of a building all of a sudden. They just teleport there.
10) The jetpack doesn't has a few animation the original game has.
11) You cannot tell when the vehicle you're driving is smoking or even on fire. It feels like you are just bumping the car and it catching fire. Or when the truck you're driving is actually on fire but you didin't see it and it explodes out of blue.

1547000,True,"I first played San Andreas when I was about ten years old, which honestly feels insane looking back now. I loved every second of it as a kid and somehow even managed to finish it, even though I definitely didn’t understand half of what was going on. Replaying it now as an adult, with a 9-year-old daughter of my own, I genuinely can’t imagine her playing anything like this at that age. It blows my mind that this was just “normal gaming childhood” for me and my mates.

A few years later, when we were teenagers, me and my best mate used to sit next to each other with pieces of paper covered in cheat codes. We wrote them all by hand, half of them barely readable, and we’d be shouting things like “R1, R1, Circle, R2, Up, Down, Up, Down—NO, THE OTHER DOWN!” just to spawn a jetpack or a tank. We didn’t have Google or guides, just trial and error and a lot of laughter.

Coming back to it now, it’s still honestly one of the best games ever made. The story is way better than I remembered, the characters are still iconic, and the open world was insane for the time. Three cities, the countryside, the desert, casinos, mountains — it still feels huge today.

And the soundtrack… I don’t think any game has topped it. Going from Faith No More’s “Midlife Crisis” to Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name” while doing missions or just messing around was peak gaming for me growing up. No other game nails the early ’90s West Coast vibe the way this one does.

It’s weird replaying it as an adult and realising how much of it went over my head as a kid, but the nostalgia is unreal. This game was a massive part of growing up for me, and every time I hear one of those radio songs it takes me straight back.

Still one of the best games ever made. Still worth playing today.

I rather play the OG version of GTA:SA.
Thank god I own the OG Version on Steam AND have a physical copy of it.
Here are some of the Bugs I encountered in my playthrough:

• Clothing can still only be changed using the old, slow system where CJ has to walk in and out of the wardrobe.
• Props randomly fall through the ground.
• Floating grass, rocks, and other environmental assets.
• Random purple lighting appearing in San Fierro.
• Flying controls feel off—something about them is just wrong.
• Roads covered in countless broken tire models.
• Smoke/Fog sometimes turns green during certain weather conditions.
• Sky occasionally turns an unnatural green tone.
• Graffiti textures glow oddly in the environment.
• Limited vertical camera movement while driving.
• Rain causes the sound to bug out.
• Wheel Arch Angels car customization is broken (likely affecting other customization shops like the Lowrider garage as well).
• During the Los Santos riots, houses are no longer burning, removing atmosphere and impact from the event.

1547000,True,"I just finished GTA San Andreas- Definitive edition with 100% completion (including achievements), and overall it was  an amazing return to one of the most iconic games of ""ALL TIME"" . Playing as CJ again, exploring  Los Santos, San Fiero, Las Venturas brought back that classic thrill- huge map ( like everything is there desert, countryside, forests, mountains etc.) crazy missions (including those of memorable ones), and how can you give so much activities in a game during its time (Basketball, betting, eat to maintain weight, gym for muscles,tattoo, swimming to improve lung capacity which was not there in previous games, jetpack (best thing ever), and much more , Conquering gang territories to expand my gang's empire.. What else you want in this game ??

Although this remastered version adds better textures (somewhere broken which you can experience during gameplay) , better lighting (which not only looks cool and improved from OG game but it also gives ""CLASSIC FEEL"" at same time). As of controls (THIS IS REAL PAIN IN ASS), one of the worst things in this remaster version, Flying controls are so bad that it's ""IMPOSSIBLE"" to drive planes and helicopter with keyboard/mouse, which makes whole flying school missions, Zero missions, Freefall, N.O.E literally hell without controller and its soo broken that you can't change it in settings , even flying in jetpack is no fun in this game. But Autosaves in checkpoints in this game (Which was missing in Vice city) makes this game kind of easy and definitely help those OG players who will play this definitive edition upto some extent. Aiming and Shooting is good but they removed that classic damage indicator when you aim at enemy. Relection on the cars looks good in daylight. Cities look brighter and also draw distance is not that bad (I know it kills the whole vibe of San Andreas as you can see whole map from the highest point, but it's kinda subjective)

Although this game gets hate because of bugs ,glitches, but with updates many of those got fixed already as of now. Some charcater models are worst/broken in this game, which makes literally no sense for the ""DEFINITIVE EDITION"". Same as Vice city, this game also has less Radio stations/Music due to licensing issues ofcourse. Performance is Stable (there are no lags and stuters). But the ""DEFINITIVE EDITION"" still feels like running on its old foundations (Its just some improved graphics of the old version with almost negligible improvements if we compare it with old game).

FINAL VERDICT-
Still, Despite the flaws, the heart of the game remains untouched- the masterpiece story, characaters, soundtrack and open world are legendary and way ahead of its time. If you loved the original or want to experience one of the best GTA stories with updated visuals, this version is definitely worth playing. But i will recommend to buy this on sale, rather than paying full price. As previously mentioned due to its broken controls, I will recommended to play this with controller.

1547000,True,"GTA San Andreas is honestly pure nostalgia for me. Playing the Definitive Edition just brings back all those old memories, but now with way better graphics. Everything looks cleaner and more detailed, but it still feels like the same game I grew up with.

For me, this is the best GTA ever when it comes to story. CJ’s whole journey, the family drama, the gang stuff, it all just hits different. There are so many moments that stick with me even after all these years.

Even though it’s an old game, the Definitive Edition makes it feel fresh again without losing what made it special in the first place. To me, it’s still unbeatable.",1763874301,2048.0,True,False,False,0,2,0.5

1547000,True,"A generational game with a mid remaster, let's break it down:

The good:

Quality of life updates such as a weapon wheel, mission checkpoints (EPIC!) and being able to play the game with +30 fps without the physics breaking and being unable to gain altitude with certain planes. (I played with the fps capped at 144)

The graphics are great and better than before BUT the classic lighting keeps that classic feel while enchancing the overall graphics

The gunplay is great and while I almost always used the M4 and SMG's, all the guns felt good.

The Driving is also sound and the cars look better than before.

The story is as great as it has always been!

The bad:

The Radio has seen a decent amount of music CUT from the remaster thanks to R* not renewing licensing so yea that's pretty bad: Running down a dream, Hot Pants, Woman to Woman, Killing in the name and Cult of Personality to name a few. So yes that is rather disappointing.

The bugs such as guns and cars audio breaking when there's rain/storm, the edges of a lot of buildings aren't aligned properly which results in seeing the famous blue hell, the cop radio breaking with static being played until you load up a save which persists until you restart your PC (The solution I found) and the game being too dark at times where you can't see what's going on. 

Some missions are still bad if not worse, alley oop from the driving lesson cost me my 200 Euros keyboard, the Red Baron RC Plane controls so bad and Wrong side of the tracks is still a pain to do early on. Gang terrirtory and ballas not spawning in and when they do you can't start a gang war UNTIL you are in the terrirtory and THEY are also in it.

Yea it still needs some work BUT I found the game to be play able enough for me to finish this game for the first time so overall it's great but it does have it's bad quirks

GTA III runs sweet and as does Vice City... but something is going on with San Andreas unfortunately. Cruises along at 150fps on max settings but every minute or so dips to 100 (feels like 0 fps)

Not sure if its a shader issue or what, last time i played thought was resolved after playing with settings, but issue is back couple months later.  Regardless, shouldnt have to disable a bunch of features just to be playable while running on decent modern hardware.

In all seriousness, this one is not quite as bad as the other two. Don't get me wrong it fucking sucks. It's ugly, it messes with the art direction which leads to weird stuff throughout, the flying controls on PC are switched around from the original version [i.e. ""steer"" control (usually a and d) changes the yaw instead of the roll, and vice versa for the ""look left/right"" controls (usually q and e)]. I know that sounds nitpicky but considering how much flying I've done in the original it was really annoying to get used to that. Granted, the flying controls are actually all ASSIGNABLE in this game, unlike the other two, so that's nice. My standards are that low, I'm praising the game for having all the controls assignable!

Buying this trilogy without checking the issues was a fatal mistake. I wanted to relive my childhood, but instead I ran into a broken mess. Thanks, Rockstar, for once again ruining something that used to be fine.

I just don’t get the point — why ruin the camera in the remake? Bring back the old version instead of making these pointless “remasters.” Playing this game on PC feels like being forced to use a console, and it’s unbearable.

The camera is absolutely awful when driving — it makes your eyes bleed, you can’t even tilt it up properly, and it constantly centers itself like in a console port. Basically, they just dumped the console version onto PC.

Nothing works as it did in the original game. Your bicycle can easily move cars, if you have head on collision with a car on a motorbike, huge chance the car will pinball away from you. Light is terrible. Models look like they were clay, necks sometimes are like 30% of the whole model. Nothing about this brings back nostalgia of original san adreas. So sad.

1547000,True,"Everyone already knows how good San Andreas is. It’s one of those rare games that didn’t just become a classic – it became a childhood memory. Back in the PS2 days, this wasn’t just a popular game, it was THE game. You didn’t even need to play the story to have fun. Like most people, I spent countless hours roaming around Los Santos, causing chaos, stealing bikes, jumping ramps, etc. But what I enjoyed the most though was getting the classic NRG500 in the spawn everyone knows, and just jumping around on ramps, and secret stunt locations.

There was something magical about it - that feeling of discovery and endless freedom. When a friend came over and said, “Hey, did you know you can customize cars?” it was like unlocking a whole new world (because almost no one progressed the story to the point that you unlock that stuff; I only finished GTA:SA when I started playing it on PC, but there are people that have never even finished this game). Or when someone showed a cheat for flying cars, infinite ammo, or money raining from the sky, we’d all have the same reaction: “HOW THE FRICK?!” What made this even bigger was that the Internet wasn't as popular as it is today, so having to find most of these through the classic ""Cheat code guides"" books was a unique experience. Those little moments turned San Andreas into more than just a game. It became a shared experience, a universal language for anyone who grew up with a PS2.

The characters are just as unforgettable. CJ, Big Smoke, Ryder, Sweet – even Officer Tenpenny. They weren’t just NPCs; they were larger-than-life personalities that became part of pop culture. Their lines, their mannerisms, their betrayals – everything about them stuck. You can say, “All you had to do was follow the damn train, CJ!” to anyone who’s ever touched a controller, and they’ll instantly get it. That’s how iconic it is.

So when Rockstar announced the Definitive Edition, my reaction was the same as everyone else’s: FINALLY. The idea of revisiting San Andreas – but with updated graphics, modern controls, and better performance – sounded perfect. It felt like a well-deserved tribute to a game that defined an entire era of open-world gaming. And to be fair, the idea was great. The problem was the execution.

The Definitive Edition launched in a rough state. The visuals were inconsistent – some areas looked great, but others looked almost cartoonish or plastic. Character models were all over the place, and while the lighting was better in some moments, it often made the world feel strangely flat. Add in bugs, missing details, and that unmistakable “mobile port” vibe, and it was clear that the remaster lacked the soul that made the original so special.

What I felt like it wasn't a great move was removing the original game from digital stores. It felt wrong – like erasing a piece of gaming history. They were basically saying, ""Here, spend 4 times more money on the same game but somehow made worse"". The Definitive Edition should’ve celebrated the legacy of San Andreas and not replaced it, specially considering the state this was released. 

Even so, I can’t deny it – it still felt good to be back. Hearing that familiar theme song, cruising through Grove Street, seeing CJ step off the train and say, “Ah shit, here we go again”... it hit differently. Nostalgia carries a lot of weight here. Even with all its flaws, it’s hard not to smile when you’re driving through the countryside of this game with KRose blasting in the background.

In the end, GTA: San Andreas – Definitive Edition might not be the perfect remaster we hoped for, but it’s still San Andreas. Under all the glitches and the shiny (sometimes too shiny) new coat of paint, that same heart is still beating – the chaos, the humor, the freedom, the memories.

• Use a guide to collect oysters to improve lung capacity (Need 25% to continue missions in San Fierro)
• Pay ’n’ Spray and clothes swaps help clear wanted levels quickly

1547000,True,"It feels like ""forget playing this game on HD, get 2K at least"" for real, this piece of art is much better, and slightly easier with higher refresh rate, when instead of 60hz we get 180 hz, meaning, in one secend we get not 60 but 180 picutres on screen. That makes game good reamster, and enjoable comeback.

San Andreas, if you are confused how? It is early 90s of BMX bikes (that I owned) and scateboreding, fresh wave of Hip Hop, that is more chiling then Rap. Times of Nirvana, and grunge, to be hones there should be DLC with some Rock like that.

But who we get to play? Grown from street, from best frends of naibourhood that treats frends like his own bro's. The very first game, from series with that huge map, three citys. And as, always planty of irony and fun. If you know common tougne, english, you lol, a lot of time, while listening to radio stations.

1547000,True,"San Andreas is still one of the greatest open-world games ever made—an epic tale of gang wars, crooked cops, jetpacks, casinos, and eating 47 hamburgers before a mission because the game told you you’re “hungry.” You play as CJ, coming back home to Grove Street and immediately getting dragged into chaos that escalates from bicycle theft to literally stealing fighter jets from a military base.

The Definitive Edition, though… let’s just say it feels less “definitive” and more “mobile port with shiny filters.” The world is brighter, models are smoother, but sometimes characters look like balloon animals that escaped a parade. Rain effects? Like someone spilled milk on your screen. Performance? Wobbly at launch, better now—but still not perfect.

Despite the jank, the heart of San Andreas is still intact. The map is massive—three cities, countryside, deserts, forests—all packed with secrets and absurd side missions (yes, you can still become a firefighter, a train conductor, or just blow everything up with a tank). The soundtrack? Untouchable. Blasting Riders on the Storm while driving through Los Santos at night is peak video game nostalgia.

It’s rough around the edges, but it’s still San Andreas. The remaster may not live up to the “definitive” name, but the game itself is so legendary it survives even the most questionable facelift.

Legacy fans will stick by the original port of San Andreas for good reason, the modding scene for the TDE is non-existent which takes a lot away from the replay value and also effects how much time a player will spend on this version of the game once beating the story and 100% list.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Story, Gameplay, Soundtrack & Downside[/h3]

Playing GTA: San Andreas back then was like diving into a massive, incredibly realistic world. Los Santos, which looked a lot like Los Angeles with its fancy parts and rough gang areas, is where it all began to get ""mainstream"". Then San Fierro transported me to a foggy, hilly version of San Francisco, and Las Venturas took me to the flashy heart of early-90s Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. San Andreas size was mind-blowing, making it much bigger than Vice City. Truth be told tough: Vice City remains my all time favorite based on atmosphere alone.

Many regard GTA: San Andreas as the standout title in the original trilogy, and for good reason. Its map is significantly larger than those of its predecessors and the main storyline is twice as long. The game features compelling characters such as Big Smoke, Officer Tenpenny, and the protagonist Carl 'CJ' Johnson, who is famous for the quote: 'Ah shit... here we go again'. As with other GTA games, the plot centres on gang warfare and police corruption, but there are also intriguing subplots that keep players engaged. I won't spoiler anything here because even though its old and a classic, there might be people interested on how the story unfolds, so let me just tell you: It's awesome.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3566111170

Returning to Los Santos after his mother's mysterious death turned out to be far more complicated than we thought. Corrupt cops framed the protagonist for a police officer's death and sent him into gang territory. The iconic characters, such as Sweet, and friends Big Smoke and Ryder, made the whole thing even more gripping. Honestly, it had one of the best stories in the series. From CJ’s conflicted return to his roots to the brutal betrayal and massive plot twists, the story felt awesome!

San Andreas stands out thanks to its attention to detail and the wide range of activities it offers. From diverse missions to side quests, there are plenty of ways to keep players entertained. The freedom to explore the vast map and interact with a variety of characters enhances the game’s replayability. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3567941619

Furthermore, the streets of San Andreas come alive with dynamic interactions that respond to Carl's appearance. If he is overweight and out of shape, he becomes the target of mockery from others. If he is fit and well-dressed, the townspeople acknowledge this positively, offering supportive comments. This feature exemplifies the game’s vibrant world, where players can witness drug deals, citizens fleeing non-player-controlled criminals and everyday traffic incidents. For a game from 2004, this was mindblowing back in the day. These elements merely scratch the surface of San Andreas immersive gameplay quality. Cars even accumulate dust and grime.

Construction workers engage in vocal interactions with passing women, and law enforcement officers diligently pursue their targets until completely out of sight. These nuanced details contribute to the game’s depth, making the virtual world feel remarkably alive and responsive to the player’s actions.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3574988834

Despite the passage of time, the gameplay mechanics of San Andreas remain solid, standing as a testament to the title’s enduring appeal. Whether engaging in intense shootouts, high-speed chases, or simply soaking in the atmosphere of its world, GTA: San Andreas delivers a gameplay experience that has become a benchmark within the GTA series and the reason GTA 5 is what it is today and probably what GTA 6 will even improve further.

The downside, though, is in the sound department. Sometimes there is crackling, because the sound files are heavily compressed. Also: even when you're standing still, the sound of driving faster sometimes loops making it sound like you accelerate on a bike, but you are not. Some bugs are unnecessary and shouldn't be here. The modern controls for swimming and flying feel awful sometimes and CJ dives into the water when I only want to swim faster and press the X button repeatedly.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

In the world of open-world gaming, GTA: San Andreas is a timeless masterpiece that transcends its era. With its massive map, diverse cities and captivating storyline, it effortlessly embodies the essence of great gameplay. Its iconic status is elevated by the attention to detail, from dynamic evolving graphics to a responsive and vibrant world. The trilogy is a must-have for everyone who wants to experience a classic in a new look and yes it is worth it. The initial release of the Definitive Edition trilogy was poor, but they patched it. Not perfect, but completely playable. As someone who has completed all the games multiple times and still plays Vice City to completion like once a year, I can say: they're beautiful!

1547000,True,"After VC I got the 100% and all steam achievements for SA too. This was my first time playing the Definitive Edition since I've been a fan since my teenage years (let's just say late 2000s, early 2010s) 

The game is obviously still as amazing as it was back then. The DE definitely made it look better (except the girls, why do all the girls' faces look so cursed still :')) and the checkpoint system made playing through the game so much more enjoyable. As an adult the game is overall so much easier (all those years of LoL taught me some mechanical skills I guess), but in good old GTA fashion missions can go wrong through small mistakes or bad luck and it's nice not having to redo everything. It was quite redundant in VC cause the missions were relatively short and the map was smaller. The only thing it did was not having to reload and travel from the safe house to the mission everytime, but in SA there's A LOT of driving. Sometimes half of a mission is just driving through the countryside or the desert, which in cases where you effed up a mission, made the game really tedious. It was the biggest weakness of the game, which checkpoints singlehandedly solved. I still felt like this GTA in particular requires you to drive a lot more than any other, sometimes too much for my personal taste (I'm more of a shootout-enjoyer, no wonder I was never bored with GTA IV despite its very repetitive missions) so if we're looking strictly at how consistently enjoyable a full story playthrough is, VC is still a winner for me. But for the overall gameplay, the common saying in the fandom ""GTA 3 walked so Vice City could ran, and Vice City ran so San Andreas could fly"" holds up very well. We have improved physics, added mechanics such as climbing walls, stealth and swimming, bigger (maybe a bit too big haha) map, more overall content, improved characterization, and the list goes on + I think this was the first game that embraced the little side-activities, a concept which they kept in later titles. You can perform dance routines at night clubs, go the gym and get jacked, date girls, gamble in casinos, you can even play a basketball minigame. I didn't even know some of these until the 100% + achievements playthrough.

I do have some critiques, outside of bugs remaining from the old game, what I do believe is Definitive Edition specific, or could be something wrong with my PC too: I've experienced some fps drops (not to an unplayable degree but definitely noticable), as well as startup issues. As for the latter, with a fresh system boot the game never starts on first attempt. I always have to force close it for not responding, and on second and every consecutive attempt the game starts without issues. Weird, but at least it doesn't randomly quit to windowed mode when a try to skip a cutscene like in Vice City lmao.

Do I recommend it? Absolutely, but whether you should start with this, depends. 
If you're a fan of the HD titles and just looking to get a taste of what the 3D universe was like, go for SA, since it's the closest to the HD games in terms of mechanic complexity. But if you're interested in the other two as well, try playing it in release order because the improvement is so gigantic between games (especially III to VC) that it won't feel good going backwards. And if you don't end up enjoying III, give VC and SA a shot too. 
If you're looking to get into the franchise, if retro games aren't alien for you, go for SA, but if you're into modern games, go for V to get a taste of GTA and see if you like it. I mean the core gameplay is the same. Be a bad boy, drive, shoot people, complete missions, run away from cops.",1758922488,4241.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5038167834281921

1547000,True,"If you have never played the original GTA SA, this game is a fantastic recreation of the old game. It has its bugs here and there, but the story still holds up to modern times (2025), and the upgraded graphics and control scheme really help make the game remain playable.
Not to mention that some of the bugs can actually enhance the game slightly (such as the burglary money glitch)

The game engine is a bit buggy; the Rockstar engine can't handle above 147 fps, but I have experienced that with this game, above 138 fps creates graphical issues, and above 60 fps creates animation timing issues (cars moving to the wrong location when being driven by NPCs and the like). 

This game plays quite nicely at 30 fps if you have a controller, so if you want the best experience, locking the game to 30 and playing with a controller will have the best playing result. 

On a Radeon GPU, I would advise disabling all GPU enhancement features for the game since most of them conflict with the game engine, such as Enhanced VSync or Anti-Lag, which creates this really bad tearing effect in the game that is very distracting. Not sure if this is also the case on Nvidia GPUs.

1547000,False,"Grand Theft Auto San Andreas: The Definitive Edition - Should Grove Street Have Stayed the Same?

[Introduction]

Released in 2004, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was a groundbreaking title in the gaming world. As perhaps the most beloved entry in Rockstar Games’ legendary GTA series, San Andreas captured hearts with its expansive map, unforgettable characters, and an incredible sense of freedom that was revolutionary for its time. Years later, in 2021, it was remastered and brought to modern platforms under the title ""The Definitive Edition."" But how well does this new version carry the legacy of the original?

[Gameplay]

The Definitive Edition largely preserves the core gameplay structure. The story of CJ returning to his family and neighborhood to lead Grove Street back to prominence remains engaging and nostalgic. Players can freely explore three major cities, take on missions, engage in gang wars, and discover a variety of activities within the open world. This sense of freedom, one of the series' strongest aspects, is still very much intact.

However, the modern tweaks to the control system don’t always deliver a smooth experience. Features like the weapon wheel and improved aiming system—clearly inspired by GTA V—look good on paper, but they don’t fully mesh with the game’s older mechanics. Driving physics and character animations, in particular, often feel clunky and artificial. Overall, while the spirit of the original is mostly preserved, the attempt to modernize it falls short in several key areas.

[Graphics and Sounds]

The Definitive Edition has undergone a significant visual transformation. With the switch to Unreal Engine, lighting has become more dynamic, textures sharper, and the overall atmosphere more colorful. Especially scenes like sunsets and nights look impressive at first glance. However, these visual upgrades don’t always serve the spirit of the game. Character models often deviate from the original design, taking on an artificial and cartoonish appearance. This can weaken the emotional connection players have with the story. Some effects, particularly rain, can feel unrealistic and sometimes overwhelming enough to negatively impact gameplay.

On the sound design side, things are generally more consistent. Original voice acting has been preserved, and the characters’ iconic lines are still delivered impressively. Vehicle sounds, gunfire effects, and environmental audio are at a satisfying level. Radio stations remain one of the key elements strengthening the game’s atmosphere. Although the series’ signature music playlists are mostly intact, some songs are missing from this version due to expired licensing. Nevertheless, the music selection still successfully captures the spirit of the era and largely maintains the nostalgic impact.

[Conclusion]

GTA: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition sparked major controversies upon its release. The game’s technical shortcomings, numerous bugs, crashes and lack of optimization led to serious criticism during the first weeks. In response to the intense backlash Rockstar issued an apology and attempted to fix the game through multiple updates. However even these patches were not enough to erase the initial negative impression. Many players described this version which failed to capture the spirit of the original as ""incomplete and rushed."" Especially for the remake of such an iconic game expectations were naturally much higher. As a result the Definitive Edition fell short of its potential both due to technical issues and design choices and it remains remembered as a project that wasted a great opportunity.

 The map is massive (especially for its time). Driving through Los Santos, exploring the desert, or hitting up Las Venturas feels like you’re in a whole different world. There’s just so much freedom while doing missions, messing around, or just cruising with the king of cars SULTANNN <3

""Childhood Chaos, Now in HD — And Yes, I Still Rode a Bike for 3 Hours""

GTA: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition is the glow-up of my reckless teenage years. The graphics? Smoother. The city? Bigger than my attention span. The nostalgia? Hits harder than Big Smoke’s order at Cluckin’ Bell.

You play as CJ, a man who just wanted to go home but instead got dragged into a whirlwind of gang wars, corrupt cops, and driving across the entire state just to deliver a pizza. It’s freedom, chaos, and comedy rolled into one—basically a life simulator if your life included jetpacks and chainsaws.

The remaster makes everything look cleaner, but the heart of San Andreas is still the same: stealing cars, ignoring the main story for hours, and wondering if you should go to the gym or just eat 40 burgers. Spoiler: it’s the burgers.

By the time I finished, I wasn’t just playing a game—I was reliving a piece of gaming history. It’s the rare remaster that makes you feel like a kid again while still reminding you that you’re way worse at flying planes than you remembered.

1547000,True,"GTA San Andreas has always been a huge part of my childhood, so playing the Definitive Edition feels really special. The story, the characters, the world – it all brings back so many memories.
Of course, the game isn’t perfect, but for me that doesn’t really matter. It’s about the atmosphere and the nostalgia, and this version gave me the chance to relive those moments in a fresh way.
Driving around Los Santos with the soundtrack blasting feels just like the old days, only now with updated visuals. I honestly got hooked all over again.

1547000,True,"San Andreas is a legendary game I first played back in school. A massive open world with three cities, countryside, roads, and dozens of mechanics: going to the gym, customizing cars, dating, side jobs. The story and characters still feel real, and CJ stands apart from Tommy or Claude: just a regular guy caught in the storm of events.

The remaster lets you experience it again with updated visuals and modern platform support. Yes, there are issues: bugs, different music, odd physics. But the atmosphere remains intact. This is a “new breath” for a classic that’s still worth playing.

 Pros:
✔Massive open world.
✔Lively characters and strong story.
✔Tons of activities and freedom of choice.
✔90s gangster vibe and atmosphere.
✔Second life on modern platforms.

 Cons:
➖Bugs with physics and textures.
➖Changed music (licensing issues).
➖Technical limitations of the remaster.

Conclusion:
San Andreas is already history and a hallmark of its time. The remaster isn’t perfect, but it gives the game new life. Veterans will understand, newcomers will too.

Rating: 8/10

🎮 Fun Facts:
The “Just Business” mission directly references Terminator 2’s chase scene.
Claude from GTA III and his girlfriend Catalina make an appearance.
The story was inspired by the real Bloods vs Crips gang war in the 90s.",1756422028,2916.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5238095521926879

A game that doesn't need to be described. In other words, I really don’t need to convince you to buy it.

But, in case you are one of those suspicious people, I’ve made a list for you:

- Have you ever heard about The Odyssey? Yes, the ancient greek story? Never mind, this one is better.

- Ever heard about John Williams? Yes, the composer of the Star Wars soundtrack. No? Whatever, the soundtrack from Michael Hunter in this game beats it.

- You may be thinking: “aw the game is old! Graphics must suck!” Guess what? It was remastered, genius. It won’t be like a Da Vinci painting, but who cares?

- Aircrafts, boats, cars to customize, guns, minigun, RPG, gang wars, a huge map with a CASINO and GYMS where you can get RIPPED or learn KARATE! What else do you want?

Name it! This game has everything you can imagine when you think about a Grand Theft Auto.

Cons: You have to pay for it. Don’t be a cheapskate.

1547000,True,"🚲🍔 GTA: San Andreas – The Crown Jewel of the PS2 Era 🏆🌆

If Grand Theft Auto V is the modern king, San Andreas is the legendary war hero whose medals still shine brighter than most new games. This isn’t just nostalgia talking — this is the open-world blueprint, the game that turned a digital state into your second home.

From the very first line — ""Ah s**, here we go again""* — you know you’re in for something special. You play as Carl “CJ” Johnson, returning to Los Santos after his mother’s death, only to be thrown headfirst into gang wars, corrupt cops, and a criminal empire that somehow stretches from urban turf battles to government conspiracy missions in the desert.

San Andreas didn’t give you a city — it gave you an entire state. Los Santos, San Fierro, Las Venturas, and everything in between. Rolling hills, sun-scorched deserts, neon-lit casinos, foggy bridges — it’s a playground so massive it made us wonder how the PS2 didn’t just catch fire trying to render it.

The freedom was unmatched. Wanna hit the gym and get swole? Do it. Wanna eat 37 Cluckin’ Bell meals and become hilariously overweight? Go ahead. Wanna ditch the main story for hours just to gamble in Las Venturas, rob the casino, and parachute into the countryside? Absolutely.

And the side activities — oh my god. BMX challenges, lowrider competitions, pimping missions, burglary sprees, jetpacks, fighter jets, trains you can hijack, UFO myths that kept forums buzzing for years… San Andreas wasn’t just a game; it was an entire urban legend generator.

The soundtrack? Untouchable. You’re cruising down the highway with K-DST blasting classic rock one moment, then robbing a store with Radio Los Santos dropping West Coast bangers the next.

And let’s talk missions: robbing a moving train with Big Smoke, that insane RC plane mission, breaking into a military base for a jetpack, flying to Liberty City for a quick hit job… every single one is burned into gaming history.

20/10 – GTA: San Andreas is more than a game — it’s the grandfather of chaos, the cultural reset that made us believe games could be this big, this free, and this unforgettable. Rockstar didn’t just make a game here — they built a mythology.",1755062185,1947.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1547000,True,"《GTA: San Andreas》是我青春的一部分，也是我对开放世界最初的认知。你从机场下飞机，CJ 拎着包回到格罗夫街，看似是为了葬礼，其实是被命运硬拽回旧生活。CJ 不是圣人，他年轻时干过混账事，中途还因为怕事逃到自由城，回来后也不是立刻就变成什么大英雄。他嘴上说着“家人第一”，可有时候做的事不够聪明，甚至有点天真。但这正是他让人共鸣的地方——他是会犯错的普通人，却一次次选择站回格罗夫街，把家人和兄弟找回来。这代的自由度和细节到现在都让人惊讶：在乡村骑自行车，在城市飙低趴，深夜听着收音机跑长途，或者只是去海边发呆。最终版画面虽然有争议，但至少让我找回了那种 2004 年第一次打开游戏的味道。CJ 不是最完美的主角，但他是最真诚的之一。

GTA: San Andreas is part of my youth, and my first real taste of what an open world could feel like. CJ gets off the plane, carrying a bag back to Grove Street. On the surface it’s for a funeral, but really, it’s fate dragging him back into the old life. CJ isn’t a saint. He did some dumb stuff when he was younger, even ran away to Liberty City when things got rough. And when he comes back, he doesn’t instantly turn into some flawless hero. He talks about “family first,” but sometimes his actions aren’t the smartest — even a little naïve. But that’s what makes him relatable: he’s an ordinary guy who makes mistakes, yet still chooses, again and again, to stand with Grove Street, to bring his family and friends back together. The freedom and little details in this game still amaze me even today — riding a bike in the countryside, cruising lowriders in the city, listening to the radio on a long night drive, or just staring at the ocean. The Definitive Edition’s visuals are… debatable, but it still gave me that same feeling I had in 2004 when I booted it up for the first time.

It does a decent job cleaning things up for modern systems. I never actually finished or played San Andreas properly back in the day, just messed around on friends’ PCs, but now diving into it properly, it’s easy to see why it was such a big deal.

There’s an insane amount to do. That's a huge plus. The story isn't on the level of GTA IV’s which is more grounded, an emotional narrative, but it’s fun and packed with personality. You can also clearly see how many ideas from GTA V were born here.

For a game from 2004, it’s massive. The remaster helps make it more approachable today, and despite its rough edges, it’s still a blast to play.

1547000,True,"(tldr at end) The Definitive edition has come a decent way from when it first launched. When the Definitive Edition first dropped, I was one of many that was disappointed by it. Still having the first versions of them backed up on my PC, I can say for sure they've come a long way and are actually worth now over the originals. The DEs you can just play the game perfectly fine on modern machines without having to download a bunch of various fixes & mods like you do on the original versions just to get your mouse to work or better widescreen support. These versions also crash significantly less than the originals too in my experience, I've had this game crash on me one time thus far and it was one I was attempting an AJS run (tldr a glitch that manipulates scripts and allows you to start the last mission by killing yourself during the third mission). That being said, if you do encounter a crash; there are autosaves in this version.
I also feel as though they have made the ped/player models a lot less ""waxy"" than they looked before and I will that is probably the one area of this game where I think the originals are better (apart from the better looking hand/mouth animations & added ped models in DE). I also dislike the removal of the ammunation ammo duping glitch (repeatedly walking into the shooting range on the original would 2x your ammo in the held weapon), and expanded gang territory glitch as these somehow made it into the Xbox360/PS3 remasters & older mobile ports but somehow not DE :/.
Overall though I think the only thing these DEs are missing is just some extra/added content and I think it would be a great chance for the developers to add something ""new"" to these games. Just small things like some form of New Game+ 

TLDR:
Gameplay experience is nowhere near as horrendous as it was on launch, and actually looks better (again skin textures could be a little better) than the originals now with PS2 lighting and fog enabled. If you want to just play the OG GTA Trilogy without downloading a bunch of downpatchers & mouse/controller fixes, this is the move.

I've rated the original game a 5/5, and I'm on the border here. Mechanically, the Definitive Edition is good, but certain visual aspects of this remaster bring it down for me. Don't get me wrong, the game looks really nice with the new lighting and textures, but you can't unnotice some of the things. I'll mention these issues further.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3525481629

So, San Andreas is kind of the pinnacle of the original 3D GTA formula. This game is so incredibly versatile in every aspect that it's impossible to not have fun. All of the ideas that were previously there in Vice City are here too, but upgraded, and they have decided to experiment with so many new features. They created a world that feels, not just populated, but fully alive.

The world is interconnected very well, with 3 major cities and rural areas between them, including a desert. But what really made this amazing is the sandbox nature of the game and the atmosphere these separate parts set. They artfully used different colors and textures to go with all of these areas which makes a very strong mental map. Many visually appealing landmarks are there and it's easy to orient yourself and remember the map. Los Santos especially is very detailed and intricate, with a ton of parks, backyards, back alleys and narrow streets. And they're not just there by gimmick, they're used in missions a lot, but it also offers the player a great amount of different escape routes for different occasions.
Then suddenly, out of Los Santos, you're thrown into this small rural area in the middle of nowhere. Hills and hillbilies. Forests of tall conifers and dirt roads all around. It's not even a three minute ride outside of Los Santos, but it feels like a completely different world.
""The emptiness of much outside of Los Santos is a testament to it's overambition"", but at the same time it works incredibly well with the narrative, with everything falling apart and being far away from ""home"", because Los Santos and the ""hood"" as Sweet says is ""where all their lives began, and will probably end"". Surprisingly, these certain empty areas and their weird environments gave an incredible landscape to be filled with player's imaginations, creating community myths of ghosts, bigfoots and other cryptids.
San Fierro and Las Venturas feel very complete and their design and atmosphere makes them very distinct from other areas. They don't suffer from this game being as ambitious as it is.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3525486854

Now, onto the story. The story of San Andreas is iconic because of the way it grabs the player and holds him relatable at times. CJ feels real and the struggles he goes through with his family and his surrounding is personal and grounded. He is desperately trying to make it out of the ""hood"", but while doing so, he's abandoning his brother and the others that were there for him, which are now facing hard fights and even harder losses. ""Grove Street slowly becomes a symbol for optimism in the face of decay and resistance in the face of oppression"". Going back to Grove Street feels like coming back home. The sense of optimism and progression in the first part of the game makes the gut-punching betrayal plot twist so much stronger and effective. It's a realistically cruel reality check for the player as much as for CJ. That's what makes the come-up story of CJ so much more important and resonant within the player. However, while building his empire, CJ forgets his origins and leaves the ""hood"" behind, saying ""What the hood done for me? Always dragging me down"". Sweet confronts him on this and reminds him that he's once again leaving his work ""half-assed"". He has forgot who the oppressor is, what he has done, and left it as a loose end. This is a very strong moment in the story where CJ realizes that he has to snap his focus back and it makes the ending narrative so much more important.

San Andreas wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't accompanied by the series' most impactful characters. The greater emphasis here is on character relationships and interactions, which really feels like a two-way street. I've already mentioned Sweet, but this game wouldn't be what it is if there wasn't for Ryder and Big Smoke. Both incredibly well written, [spoiler]even though Ryder's death is a bit anticlimatic[/spoiler], they share very deep motives and are probably the franchise's most iconic side characters. Next to that we have officer Tennpeny, voiced by no one else than the legend Samuel L. Jackson, making not just a great performance, but which is also written very well and is of great essence to the story. And the list goes on, there is a ton of highly interesting characters, with great performances, and most importantly none of them lack personality in their portrayal.

Every mission in this game feels like a real accomplishment towards something meaningful within the narrative. Even the side missions, like the gang wars. It makes open roaming Los Santos feel like a dynamic conflict is going on at all times. The variety in mission types overall is just mind blowing. It's not just typical shootout missions, there are stealth missions, assassination missions, incredible car chases, then you go to school and learn how to fly planes so you can do plane/helicopter missions, then you do boat missions, car races... And it just goes on. Business asset missions, challenges, tagging and constantly growing stats, it all feels like it's there with a narrative point, besides developing the character. Now, some missions just break this ""groundedness"" and go all out, and I would mind it, if they weren't so damn iconic and so much fun. This game was just really good at making iconic missions. CJ kind of loses his grip and the game goes a bit too much comedic during this period, but I don't personally mind it too much because the overall narrative overpowers these weak points.

This soundtrack is the best one in the franchise by far, and probably one of the best in gaming generally. Incredible variety of genres, incredible selection of songs and amazing radio hosts with great humour that is completely out of today's comfort zones. These radio stations defined people's music tastes.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3524766804

Now, when it comes to my issues with the Definitive Edition, it's mostly the visual stuff.
First, the characters. CJ looks really good, but what the hell is up with his eyes? Also, his muscles still flex really weird in cutscenes (it was an issue in the original game too). When it comes to the other characters, it's really a mixed bag. Sweet's character is really low definition, so is Ryder's and Kendl's. So then why does OG Loc look way better than some of the most important characters in the game?
The UE4 anti-aliasing shows many artifacts when the player is in motion, like smudgy shadows, and the ""ghosting"" effect.
Some textures like grass etc. are completely out of place, floating in space or glitching through the roads. Sometimes textures do not physically match the model at all, so you clip into stuff. I once even got trapped within.

I like the new flying controls, but they are way too sensitive, especially if you're using the mouse, and there isn't really a way to change this sensitivity. Please bear in mind that you can fly a plane using WASD and arrow keys, which feels much better, but still too sensitive.
Game now automatically makes CJ jump over or climb upon obstacles when he runs into them, and it's really annoying at times.

I'm also kind of sad that some very iconic songs were removed due to licensing, like ""Killing in the Name Of"" and ""Runnin' Down a Dream"", but I get it.

GTA: SA is one of those colossal games where it makes no sense for it to be fully realized, yet it is. It's an achievement for gaming and it remains one of the favorites more than 20 years later.",1752610384,26907.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5183630585670471
1547000,True,"🎮 6 hours played // Review: 👍 Welcome to GTA: Glitch-ifornia, population: me

This Definitive Edition isn’t just a remaster — it’s a full-on bug festival with CJ as the reluctant ringmaster.
Forget crime, this game’s biggest enemy is physics… or whatever is left of it.

🐴 Flying Horses & Moonwalking Cows:
Who knew San Andreas had a secret space program?
I’ve seen horses casually take off like SpaceX rockets and cows moonwalk better than Michael Jackson on a dance floor made of glitches.

🚗 Vehicles:
I didn’t know GTA cars came with rocket boosters or invisibility cloaks.
One minute I’m driving, next minute I’m orbiting Earth or deep-sea diving through Los Santos like a submarine.
Side note: the car insurance must be wild.

🎮 Controls:
CJ’s got moves — mostly spinning uncontrollably like he’s caught in a blender.
Trying to park a bike? Good luck, because CJ apparently thinks it’s a breakdance contest every time you hit the throttle.

👽 NPCs:
I caught a dude glitching so hard he looked like he was buffering IRL.
Pedestrians popping in and out like bad Wi-Fi ghosts? All day, every day.
One guy froze mid-yawn and then exploded into thin air. No big deal.

💥 Missions:
Some missions are more like a trial of patience and “how many times can I get stuck in a wall before ragequitting?”
I’m pretty sure the game’s biggest boss fight is against the loading screen itself.

Final Verdict: 7/10 – It’s like GTA San Andreas… if someone remade it using Minecraft physics and a glitch factory.
P.S. If CJ hasn’t randomly flown into the stratosphere or become a ghost in the last hour, you’re playing it wrong.",1752538600,371.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.4888888895511627

That said, it is very good to be back in San Andreas and playing these missions, because even now it is among the finest of RPGs I've ever played. Real progression, real choice and agency...most modern RPGs pale compared to this game, even now.

Once again, I don't like that we had to have the ""non-definitive"" edition become unpurchaseable and nearly unplayable, but it is very welcome to come back to San Andreas, nonetheless.",1752507605,1768.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1547000,True,"This game is very enjoyable. The learning to fly mission is the only thing I ever hated because flight controls never work with keyboards. If you got through it with no issues somehow, then great job I'm proud of you! I really enjoy CJ's story and I liked jumping off the make believe golden gate bridge in the game. That was fun. I also really like going to the casino's in Las Venturas after it becomes unlocked, I'm not very good but hence it is still fun to play. This game is really long like GTA 4 but that's why I liked playing through it. I liked progressing and earning new properties and even getting a free gigantic mansion towards the end of the game after working very hard. Rockstar killed this game by releasing a remaster it could not be better I don't think. When I watched some footage of videos on youtube the game graphics looked super realistic to me and trust me they still did but you'll feel like this game is your reality if you watch gameplays of it. This game will change your life as it is very inspirational and it's my favorite GTA game, because you can also work out, go to restaurants, hang out with the boys in the gang and take over the hoods, also having the ability to swim is a big upgrade from vice city and GTA 3, also making this game the best of the trilogy. So overall getting the best of 3 cities, San Fierro (SF IRL), Los Santos (LA IRL), and Las Venturas (LV IRL) also makes this the most enjoyable map to play around. This game also has the higher hand than GTA 4 because you can dive underwater and fly airplanes including regular jets even though I was afraid flying them would be difficult it ended up being fun. The aspect of the game is truly remarkable and remembered for being such a classic since 2004 which means it's over 20 years old. If you loved the original version, PLEASE PLAY THIS IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE IT IS AWESOME! I would literally recommend this game to anybody it is very good and you will likely have a lot of fun trying this game especially with the fact that at a certain point if you play enough story you get such big world and all that.

1547000,True,"beat about half of this game so far and its not bad, bought this in the summer sale in June 2025 for not that much. the only real problem I have with this game is when you collide with trees, hay bales, street poles, they all break and fall through the floor. its the only really big problem I have and once I noticed this it really cant be unseen. But I would much rather play this version that the original base version 100%. I wish the keyboard and mouse controls worked a lot better tho like looking vertically on mouse especially in the fire truck sub missions it was really hard for me to aim directly where I wanted to hit. I legit had to do like 3 full mouse swipes on my desk to look down. the game runs good on 3060 ti, I've been messing with the settings and I couldn't figure out why my game kept going down to 48 fps but then I changed something and now I'm doing consistent 120 fps with drops down to 78 fps sometimes but I cant complain unless its less than 60 fps.
but then debating if the definitive edition is better than modded original game is a big debate. I mean I love the check points they added and stuff but the modded original game has better game play in my opinion the definitive edition runs better than modded OG idkk. I think they are pretty even. and getting more frames in the OG modded game was tough for me to figure out for some reason and I remember if you vault over something with more than 25 fps you would die instantly and that made me soo mad on the OG san andreas. 

I hope they fix the mouse controls while looking around in cars and then they actually make the hay bales, trees, and street lights fall on the ground and then disappear. instead of them just falling through the ground. it actually looks terrible when they just fall through the floor.

I know this probably sounds like a negative review but I would much rather play this version of the game other than modded OG san andreas (og san andreas if you want more than 25 fps its unplayable without mods). modding the game just took me forever to do and I factory reset my pc and lost my save and mods I installed and the mods I had make characters look weird
I don't know how the other games run yet but this game in this version was worth $24 I paid for all three games alone. full price ($60) is a BIG no from me.",1752009557,1440.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4799999892711639

Performance-wise, it’s better now after a bunch of patches, but still not perfect.

Music? Mostly intact, but yeah… some classics are gone due to licensing, which sucks. Still, the radio stations are great and totally set the vibe.

1547000,False,"Back in 2021 the GTA trilogy remasters had one of the worst launches of gaming in history. Later came to be known as the ""bugfinitive edition"" online. It later cemented itself as one of the worst remasters ever made at the time. The three games in it were basically unplayable due to the large amount of bugs, glitches, and crashes filled in the games. 

Is this still the case today? Yes and no. Most of the game breaking bugs and visual bugs have since been patched out. Models deemed poor quality were updated to be more tolerable, and some graphical options were fixed.   

The main reason people will play this nowadays is A. the original was removed from sale  B. Modern QoL updates

Pros: Easily the best of the trilogy in terms of open world game play and customization 
         Three separate cities which are essentially their own world spaces to explore and play in
         Story is great especially at the beginning and the final acts. 

Neutral:  Modern gaming QoL updates. 
Checkpoints: Checkpoints were added into missions to allow redoing them without having to go back to the original mission startup. easily the best of these features if you plan on doing the story, Difficulty re-balancing: story missions across the trilogy were made easier and less frustrating, and updated mini map to locate and find collectibles easier.
            
Cons: Graphic style while okay. Could have been done MUCH better especially with them using Unreal engine. 
Online DRM: requires the rock-star launcher to be able to play. 
No major mod support: Major appeal of San Andreas was the mod support and some of the things people did with are truly amazing. Removing it removes incentive to go back and replay it. 
Soundtrack: due to licensing some of the soundtrack of the original was removed. 

Would give a neutral score if there was one.  Only incentive to play over the original is beating the story is less of a pain due to QoL updates. If you plan on just doing that get it on sale. 
If you want to either mod, do more in the open world, or don't like the idea of having DRM for the game.

1547000,True,"Compared to the GTA SA I played PS2 all those years ago, the definitive edition is slightly different (we now have achievements, etc.) and all the missions are quite easy to complete (checkpoints added).

The game works with no game-breaking bugs so if you feel like taking the effort to do everything once over then sure, might be just the thing for you. There's no noticeable QoL improvements besides the lowered difficulty so in essence this game offers nothing new over the original besides metallic paint jobs and enhanced image quality. I was hoping to see e.g., progression to 100% but no such luck. The GPS feature does not work 100% of the time with my controller and in-game it doesn't always show the shortest route (might need to make several unnecessary turns). There are small changes but overall everything feels in place.

So did this meet my expectations? Well there is nothing really new here. The core gameplay is as good as it ever was. In terms of the story, this might still be my favourite in the series but cannot be too sure these days. I think the game felt a bit too easy after doing 100% on RDR2 besides knowing so much about the game from before. GTA V has better gameplay, custom radio station, online mode, so it's not so simple to put my finger on what makes this game a good purchase especially as it comes in a trilogy and cannot be purchased separately (I have the old version too). 

Tldr - should you buy this game (trilogy)? if you want something casual and interested in 100%, perhaps. For a new player, for the story and the experience (not 100%). Still would only buy it on sale. I didn't add any mods like back in the day but I don't see the point for that either as GTA V is available with much more variety. GTA SA will remain, as one of those games that used to be good. Now it's time to move on to new things.

1547000,True,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - 10/10

This game is a timeless example of how games do not need to have fancy graphics and raytracing. 
We are moving towards a society in gaming where if you do not have the best graphics your game is considered to be bad or not good. GTA San Andreas proves that the content in your game is the most important thing to create immersion.

I can't tell you how many times I will forget I'm even playing a game especially in the countryside areas which happen to be my favourite part of the game. This game places tons and tons of environmental objects and makes the whole place feel so so real.

GTA San Andreas takes what was wrong with GTA 3 and Vice city and not only fixes it but adds so much more on top of that. It's a passion project that Rockstar Games spent years on making the game as good as possible. 

The game is split into 3 cities and each city feels like you're playing a completely different game with its own story and problems to face.

Los Santos - This is the gangster paradise city and the city this game is well known for inspired by Los Angeles. All the characters and missions feel like you are stepping inside a gang warfare.

San Fierro - This is the Librerty City of the game. Inspired by San Francisco this city feels like your're playing gta 3. And that doesn't just extend to the environment the missions imitate a lot of GTA 3s take one person out missions except this time these missions are pretty well structured.

Las Venturas - This is like playing Vice City. Inspired by Las Vega, it has the 1980s feel and missions that feel like they've been dragged from plots of hit 1980s movies. Missions about stealing jetpacks and planes and robbing a casino.

Above all else the countryside was my favourite area. Driving through it on the steam deck whilst relaxing in bed at 1am was one of the most relaxing and enjoyable things I've played. It's packed with farms and trees and tall mountain forest paths. I don't think anything has come close to it in the GTA Series. GTA 5 has some countryside but nothing compared to the scale of San Andreas. GTA 6 does look promising and will likely try to do the same but I doubt it will be anything close to San Andreas's countryside.

That's not to say everything in the game was good. Some of the later missions were kinda unfair and unnecessary. I was intending to give the game a 9 out of 10 score but when I considered all the extra stuff I had to change to a 10

Oh and yeah all the extra stuff! There's so much to do after you've beaten the game. There's arcades games to play, pool, randomly generated burglary missions, casino games (video poker is fun I got two three of a kinds in a row and won over $100000 lmao) roulette, slot machines, and theres so so so much more to do.
Because of all that, thats why I'm giving this game a 10. It goes further and beyond than any game before and no wonder this game was the best selling PS2 game.",1751644005,2006.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

[i][b]What I Played:[/b][/i] The Definitive Edition of San Andreas, revisiting a legendary story and world.

[b]The Good:[/b]

• A landmark in gaming history – one of the greatest open-world experiences ever.
• Story, characters, and combat are as strong as ever.
• Side content is still unmatched – from gang wars to dating to vehicle challenges.
• The soundtrack remains iconic, even with some tracks removed.

[b]The Bad:[/b]

• The PC port inherits quirks from the mobile version, simplifying things like the gym and dancing minigames for no reason.
• The camera is broken in vehicles – you can’t move it up or down without mods, which is a huge annoyance.
• Performance can be inconsistent, though not as bad as GTA III.

[b]Verdict:[/b] Worth it on Sale – San Andreas remains the best of the trilogy, even in Definitive Edition form. Still, I’d recommend playing the originals with mods if you want the true experience. For fans and newcomers who don’t mind some rough edges, this is a great way to experience a legendary game.",1751465310,2868.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5
1547000,True,"It’s hard to explain what Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas really means to me. To some, it’s just a game—a chaotic sandbox with guns, gangsters, and a whole lot of swearing. But to me? It’s something else entirely. It's not just a chapter in gaming history. It is my history. It was my childhood.
I remember being just a kid, booting up my beat-up old PC, the fan roaring louder than a jet engine, just to escape into the sun-drenched streets of Los Santos. That opening theme—those few notes—already had me hooked before the game even began. It was more than entertainment; it was an escape, a lifestyle, a ritual. Whether it was single-player or SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer), San Andreas was the game. The game that defined what gaming could be.
San Andreas wasn’t just a game; it was a world. A living, breathing world full of character, chaos, color, and charm. I used to roam the cities aimlessly, not even following missions sometimes. Just... existing there. Driving around, listening to K-DST or Radio Los Santos, vibing with the weather effects, watching random NPCs fight on the streets or get arrested—everything felt dynamic and alive.
But what really cemented this game in my memory forever was SAMP. Oh man, the community servers. That’s where magic truly happened. From roleplay servers where I tried to become a humble cab driver to wild stunt servers where I launched cars off impossible ramps—it was limitless. I made friends I never met in real life. I joined gangs, I ran casinos, I played ridiculous Cops vs Robbers. It was chaos and joy, completely unscripted and full of laughs. It wasn’t just me playing a game—it was me living inside one.
But even beyond the multiplayer madness, the single-player story of San Andreas is one of the best-written, most engaging tales I’ve ever played through. It starts simple—you return home to Los Santos after your mom dies. But quickly, it spirals into something far deeper and more powerful.
Carl “CJ” Johnson is hands down one of the most iconic, relatable protagonists in gaming history. He’s not some overpowered superhero. He’s not a soldier of fortune. He’s just a man trying to do right by his family, caught between loyalty to his crew and a city that’s crumbling around him. CJ’s growth throughout the game—from a scared, unsure guy to a total boss who owns properties, flies jets, and topples entire crime empires—is legendary.
Each mission reveals more layers: the betrayal by Big Smoke and Ryder, the manipulation of Officer Tenpenny (voiced chillingly by Samuel L. Jackson), and the eventual rise of CJ from the streets to the top of the food chain. The narrative is dripping with drama, corruption, family ties, survival, and ambition. It never feels fake. It hits hard. It tells the story of an underdog rising from the dirt—and you live every step of that climb.
This game was ahead of its time. I didn’t realize it as a kid, but now, looking back, San Andreas was ridiculously ambitious. The amount of content they packed into this thing is insane. Want to be a bodybuilder? Hit the gym. Want to eat until CJ gets fat? Sure, go ahead. Want to customize cars, spray tags, find collectibles, gamble in casinos, pilot planes, drive trains, or just ride a bike through the hills of San Fierro at sunset? You can do all of that.
Even now, decades later, I’ve never played a game that gave me this much freedom. It didn't force you to rush through missions or follow a linear path. It gave you a world, and it said: “Go live in it.” And I did. Over and over again.
And let’s not forget the cheat codes. Who among us didn’t summon a tank on the freeway just for laughs, or spawn a jetpack to fly around the desert like some kind of cartoon superhero? Even cheating was part of the fun. San Andreas didn’t punish you—it let you go wild.
San Andreas oozed style. From the 90s West Coast aesthetic to the music that plays through your ears long after the game’s closed, everything had flavor. Radio Los Santos, Bounce FM, K-Rose—all legendary. Each radio station was a time capsule of genre, mood, and soul. I discovered music I’d never have listened to otherwise—now burned into my memory.
Even the fashion, the slang, the graffiti, the hairstyles—all of it captured that gritty, raw feel of 90s LA-inspired culture. You felt immersed. You felt cool just walking around. It didn’t feel like you were playing CJ. It felt like you were CJ.
Here we are—years and years later. Dozens of consoles, hundreds of new titles, groundbreaking graphics—and still, people talk about GTA: San Andreas. Still. Memes, quotes, remasters, mods, debates, speedruns, replays. This game refuses to die. And rightfully so.
It didn’t need ray-traced graphics or bloated DLC. It had heart. It had style. And it had that inexplicable something that so many modern games lack: soul.
People from all over the world—different backgrounds, different cultures—all know the pain of hearing “Ah s***, here we go again.” Everyone remembers their first drive across the countryside, or the mission where you sneak into Madd Dogg’s mansion, or flying a rusted crop duster to complete a secret mission in the desert. These are memories. Not pixels. Not polygons. Moments.
I don’t know if the developers ever realized what they were creating. I don't think they could’ve guessed this game would shape the childhoods of millions. That it would be the reason kids made new friends online. That it would inspire modders, artists, musicians, writers, and dreamers to express themselves through this chaotic, beautiful game.
San Andreas is not perfect—no game is. But it doesn’t have to be. Because it meant something. It still means something.
It’s more than just nostalgia. It’s a legacy.
Even today, I sometimes reinstall it. I mod it, I play it raw, or I dive back into SAMP for that sweet, chaotic energy of yesteryear. No matter how much gaming evolves, no matter how advanced the tech becomes, no matter how many blockbusters release every year—San Andreas will always be the gold standard.
A monument. A vibe. A revolution.
If you’re reading this and you haven’t played it—don’t just play it. Live it. Let yourself sink into that world, those characters, that music, that wild and wonderful place where anything felt possible.
Thank you, CJ.
Thank you, Grove Street.
Thank you, Rockstar.

Sometimes cars disappear right in front of you, not when you look away, like in the original.

They changed NPC looks for some reason. So it's harder to spot some kinds of Ballas, and especially police officers. They used to wear distinctive black uniforms, now it's grey so they blend in.

UPD:
New flight controls with the mouse suck. You can still use arrow keys for planes but removing landing gear uses middle mouse button and cannot be changed. Planes were one of the most annoying parts for me this time.

Of course the launcher. You have to be connected to internet at all times and use the uselss Rockstart launcher to play a single player games.

Cannot use mods.

Motorcyclists sometimes randomly dissapear in the country and the bikes are just lying on the road.

The recent Definitive Edition is, in my opinion, a triumph. It beautifully bridges the gap of all those years I've poured into this game, making it feel fresh and vibrant again.

1547000,True,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition tries to bring a beloved classic into the modern era, but the results are somewhat uneven. The core of San Andreas—its sprawling world, rich story, and addictive gameplay—remains just as engaging and nostalgic as ever. Exploring Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas with Carl “CJ” Johnson’s journey through gang wars, corruption, and personal redemption is timeless. The Definitive Edition improves on textures, lighting, and character models, aiming to deliver a fresher visual experience. However, these upgrades often fall short of expectations, with inconsistent graphics, awkward animations, and technical hiccups that occasionally disrupt immersion. Controls and user interface improvements inspired by newer Rockstar titles are welcome, making gameplay smoother than the original. While longtime fans might appreciate the nostalgia and newcomers get a chance to experience a GTA classic, the Definitive Edition struggles to fully honor the original’s legacy due to its rough execution. Still, beneath the flaws lies a sprawling and memorable adventure that remains one of the most influential open-world games ever made.

1547000,True,"This game is a weird mix of nostalgia, upgrades, and some straight-up “what were they thinking” moments.

Let’s start with the good: it’s still San Andreas. That massive map with Los Santos, San Fierro, Las Venturas? Still iconic. The missions? Still fun. CJ? Still a legend. The world is as wild and alive as I remember—from gang wars and lowrider meets to jumping out of planes in your boxers. And they did improve some stuff—the controls are tighter, aiming is better (feels more like GTA V now), and you can finally restart missions without rage-quitting the game.

Now the visuals… oh man. It tries. Some areas look genuinely nice, like sunsets or city lights at night. But then you see a character’s face and it’s like they melted a Sims model in the microwave. It’s not bad all the time, just inconsistent. Some textures are sharp, others look like leftovers from 2004. And don’t get me started on the rain—at launch it was like trying to play inside a car wash.

Performance-wise, it’s better now after a bunch of patches, but still not perfect. I had a few bugs, weird physics, and the occasional crash. Not game-breaking, but definitely noticeable.

Music? Mostly intact, but yeah… some classics are gone due to licensing, which sucks. Still, the radio stations are great and totally set the vibe.

At the end of the day, I had fun. It's not the “definitive” version Rockstar promised, but if you’ve got love for San Andreas and can forgive some jank, it’s worth diving in. Just know what you’re getting: a slightly modernized classic with a few cracks showing.

As for graphics? The characters look like they're made of clay. And the weapon sounds? Just awful. Gunshots sound weak and unnatural – no impact at all. Honestly, I’m speechless. I expected way more. Huge disappointment.

1547000,True,"GTA: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition – Still the King of Fun (Even With Its Bumps)

If you ask me, some games are just timeless, and GTA: San Andreas is absolutely one of them. Even in its Definitive Edition form — flaws and all — the game remains as charming and fun as it was when it first dropped back in the PS2 era. You can clean it up, you can tweak the controls, but that heart is still there.

Let’s talk about CJ. Easily one of the best protagonists Rockstar has ever written, no question. He’s up there in my top five. He grows, he struggles, he questions the world around him — and he’s also funny and relatable in ways that many GTA leads aren’t. You genuinely want to see him succeed.

At first, the game gives off “hood movie” vibes — and honestly, that first act plays like something straight out of Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society. But stick with it, because the narrative expands beyond that into political corruption, high-level crime, and government conspiracies. It’s way more layered than it first appears.

Mechanically, you have to remember this is a game originally released in 2004. Some of those gunplay mechanics still carry over, and while they might not feel cutting-edge today, they still feel good. Shooting is punchy and satisfying, and honestly, they’ve held up better than I expected.

Speaking of durability — vehicles are way tougher than in GTA III or even Vice City. You can ram into things a few times and not instantly lose your ride. It makes car chases a lot more fun and less frustrating.

One of San Andreas’s greatest strengths? Side content galore. You’ve got:

Vigilante missions

Ambulance missions

Firefighter missions

Delivery missions

Relationships with girlfriends

Gyms to buff your stats

Shooting ranges

Import/export vehicle lists

Driving, boating, flying schools

Nightclubs
There’s always something to do, and the variety keeps the world feeling alive long after the main story ends.

And when it comes to weapon feedback, this game still delivers. It might not be realistic, but it’s definitely visceral. Snipe someone in the head? Their head literally comes off. It’s dark, it’s brutal, and it makes the combat feel impactful.

The map is enormous — especially for its time. You’ve got three fully realized cities:

Los Santos

Las Venturas

San Fierro
Plus, the desert and countryside feel like entirely separate biomes. You’re not just driving through the same environments endlessly — each area has its own vibe and unique personality.

The side characters? Top tier. Cesar and Woozie are fantastic allies. Kendl is underrated and brings a lot of heart to the story. Sweet... well, he’s Sweet (if you know, you know). And of course, Big Smoke and Ryder are hilarious and iconic — perfect examples of Rockstar’s knack for writing colorful, larger-than-life characters.

And finally, one thing I’ve always loved — the shared universe between the 3D-era games. Seeing Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul from Vice City show up here is so cool. It makes the world feel connected, and those little nods are a treat for long-time fans.

Final Verdict:
Despite its Definitive Edition still suffering from some bugs and rough edges, the core magic of San Andreas remains intact. The world is massive and alive, the side content is incredibly deep, and CJ’s journey is one of the best Rockstar has ever crafted. Whether you’re playing it for the first time or revisiting a classic, it’s absolutely worth your time.

Rating: 9/10 – A masterpiece that still shines, even if the remaster isn’t quite as “definitive” as we’d like.",1749253426,1970.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I think it was “rescue mike toreno” I would do the mission and take him to jizzy’s club under the bridge and the game would crash with the ue4 game face error message. It would do this over and over.

1547000,False,"This is gonna be an overarching sentiment for the entire PS2 trilogy.

full stop? these games are not very good. I went into these in 2025 with barely any nostalgia, when I was playing them when I was younger I admit I barely followed the story, and wouldn't make it out of the first area. To be honest, this was great, as it allowed me to complete each game without rose tinted glasses. 
With that being said, how could you ever possibly enjoy these games without rose tinted glasses? Not to sound harsh, just being honest. 

I wont go into strenuous detail of each game because the problems are vague and go from game to game.

All three games suffer from old game design syndrome. Most of the time I can get behind this, I love old games and mastering them as they were, it's a looking glass into programming and *fun* philosophy and I always enjoy it. I wanted the looking glass to be a kaleidoscope, instead I got a toilet paper tube filled with shit. 

I've determined over about 60 hours of playtime throughout all of the games that the philosophy of old GTA was ""Frustrate the fuck out of your players to pad out game time, force them into mechanics that are poorly designed and not fun and block the fun missions behind bad missions that you have to do to progress.""

AI, Mission Objectives, Shooting Mechanics, Driving Mechanics, Mini-Game Mechanics... reading on reddit that these games were the GOLD STANDARD I went into them expecting something playable, and thats what I got. Something *playable for the most part*. 

San Andreas is clearly the crown jewel of this trilogy, as it does actually improve on alot of my issues with 3 and vice, but that doesn't make up for the fact that its still a polished turd. The story is it saving grace, 3 and vice city cant say the same. 

Expect frustration, antiquated game design, bad storytelling (3 and vice city) and overall lack of polish in all gameplay systems. 

The games choose repeatedly to force you into horribly designed mechanics to pad out the game and the pay off is absolutely not worth it. 

Granted, I understand the fiasco with the definitive editions, and No i will not be modding the originals to play them in their *purest form*, from what I've read most of the glitches and errors have been patched out *for the most part*. 

If you're morbidly curious, skip 3 entirely, play vice city with extreme caution because the end of the game is so so so, so so so bad, and play San Andreas for the spectacle, despite its glaring and borderline game breaking issues. (yes, I said game breaking, expect reloading saves, literally changing the FPS in the options menu during some scenes because for some reason that happens, of course it does, broken AI that WILL send you back to a checkpoint, and driving and AI mechanics that rival that one game with the Big Rigs that was really bad)

San Andreas has ALOT of issues, however, the world is beautiful, huge, and fun to explore. The GOOD missions  are some of the best Rockstar has ever made, the bad ones are just that. The story and characters are interesting and the callbacks to 3 and vice city are fun. 

I don't think I'll ever understand the hype. These games are mid, borderline garbage. Play something else.

If for any reason you didn't play the OG game and discovered this abomination...i am truly sorry for you...for some reason Rockstar ruined this remastered...they tried and tried to fix it ..but there still are few minor bugs and redesign that are horrible ! like even horrible is a word that don't describe these redesign ...some characters look much better ...more realistic but some look like not even a real person ..and if you know who i am talkin about yes...mostly the girlfriends especially the one and only Denise ...even after patches she is kind of better but still aint that beauty she was in OG game and some few really minor bugs that mostly affect the customization of CJ but this depends on the style you like him.

Despite the currently minor bugs i still discovered after those many fixes ..i still enjoyed replay my childhood game...and enjoyed it again with a more realistic vibe as even tattoos you can put on CJ are much better and much more clear.
The best part of this Definitive Edition is that we have achivements and this is a good reason if you love the achievements to enjoy once more an amazing game and earn some pretty nice achievements and an amazing feature is that they add auto save which works just for missions for some reason but that is stil a good thing as if you still fail some missions and you will fail them even if played them billions of times you won't have to restart from begin but from CP (you know the plane mission...of course you do well enjoy it now with bit more frustration  as the engine or something kind of made the planes control harder so you will pretty much need to learn to fly again :) ) and another good improvement is the radio and weapon wheel that was added later in the new HD games.

Despite the lil few pro and the more con..i still prefer the OG game over this ...it was good to see my childhood with other eyes but it was also worse to see some of my childhood ruined by Rockstar.

If you didnt played the OG and still can get it from somewhere do it ..you will enjoy it and love it much more ...however if you cant and still wanna play/replay this iconic game ..this version still do in the current state despite all todays little few minor bugs",1747000705,2722.0,True,False,False,20,2,0.6882253885269165

The Definitive Edition is a lot better than when I first played it on release on PlayStation 5. It still isn't perfect, but it's good. I had a great time with the game and enjoyed every step to achieve 100% completion.

The big negative I have for all three games included in the Definitive Edition is the Rockstar Games Launcher.

I played all the Definitive Edition games almost fully on Steam Deck, and yes, it runs, but especially in the case of San Andreas, I often lost connection to the Rockstar Games Launcher and had to sign in again very often (not that great if you need to write everything via the touch screen of the Steam Deck).

Sometimes, when I woke up my Steam Deck, after ~1 minute of playtime, the Rockstar Games Launcher just shut down the game without doing anything. I don't know why, but it sucks if your last save was a while back.

Even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Rockstar Games Launcher, I enjoyed my time with the Definitive Edition, at least with San Andreas and Vice City. GTA III aged like milk. I finished it but didn't really enjoy it.

For me, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is still the best Grand Theft Auto game released to this date. Maybe Grand Theft Auto VI will finally dethrone San Andreas for me.",1746871209,4209.0,True,False,False,11,1,0.6327168941497802

The cons of that version which i experienced are planes/helicopters, that game forces you to control a plane with a mouse with holding a left mouse click. With flying vehicles i'll recommend to use a controller, because FOR ME, controlling a plane with a mouse was for me very uncomfortable and unplayable, i was get used to with number keyboard like from OG version.

It plays better than Vice city and GTA III, however it still faces alot of bugs and oversights that shouldn't be in a product labled as The Definitive Edition. It still gets a thumbs down just due to lazy-ness. Grove Street games should have done more to make this a better remaster, it feels like a cash grab considering how long and cheap the OG was on steam for.

Pros
-It didnt crash once or break causing major issues. so props to GSG (my 100% of Vice city broke at 95% and the save got corrupted plus it also crashed every few hours)
-Some graphics look better than vice city or GTA 3 but they still look bad

Cons
- Fat CJ or Max Muscle CJ have issues with the body and head having texture issues or rig issues making his neck look really really bad
-some 4 lane roads will have AI turn right from the outside lane
-they re did the map but still managed to leave out certain bridge icons making it weird for some parts in los santos
-More in orignal review

[Original Review at 79 Mins]
Ill start by saying GTA San Andreas was one of my favorite games of all time. Ive played the original via Sailing the high seas and it was miles better than this excuse of a remaster. Same computer.

PROS
- Its San Andreas

CONS
-It plays so much worse its just hard to believe. Constant suttering, what looks to be forced DLSS/FSR3 and no way to disable it with a AMD card. 

-Physics are just terrible, along with hit box collisions. It just feels 10x worse

-Clipping textures and voids.

-Characters look like action figures

-Controls are terrible for the bike when it comes to using a weapon (Edit: Pedal Bike/BMX) 

-AI Upscaled textures with the remaning low poly models so it looks really weird.

-Cars aren't chrome as much as vice city but you can tell it doesnt look like actual paint



All 3 of the GTA's in this trilogy need to just disapear and just bring back the orignial. 

Rockstar you gave us something we didnt ask for and removed something we loved. GTA 6 is gonna be your downfall as a company if this is anything to show how your company thinks now.

1547000,True,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was, in many ways, a huge change for the series. In some ways, it was the Metal Gear Solid 3 situation: you still saw the remnants of the previous identity, that evolved and remade itself over the course of the previous games, but you could also see what the future of the franchise is going to be. And people loved it, it is considered one of the best games of all time and… I never cared about it much. There was a lot in it I remembered liking, but also a lot more that frustrated me. So the revisit with The Definitive Edition was going to be curious. And it was – I did like the game more than I originally did. But I still don’t like it very much.

GTA: San Andreas continued with the formula originally established in GTAIII and many things are immediately recognizable. Same general concepts, many of the same limitations and abilities and same, if incredibly improved from the style and technology perspective, visual identity. Original game has been quite a looker for 2004 on PS2 and while by modern standards a lot about this game visuals is extremely dated, the sense of style in how the world is presented in different lighting and weather conditions is incredible. Something that is mostly retained with the updated version of The Definitive Edition with the “Classic lighting”, since the older versions of the port completely destroyed the way the game looked like. Now it’s far from perfect, but closer to the original vision than even the old PC port of the game had.

However, the more you play the game, the more you see how things got significantly changed in comparison to the previous entries. Some major new basic elements were added, like crouching and stealth kills (clearly borrowed from Manhunt released earlier). Swimming finally became possible. An entire RPG-light system for skills and attributes was added, with the progression done The Elder Scrolls/Final Fantasy 2-style, where the more you do something, the better it gets. Bicycles were added as a new type of transportation, working off the existing mechanics of sprinting. Game got several different mini-games and concepts like dialogues, where you could reply positively or negatively… There’s a lot of small and huge stuff almost in everything that at first seems familiar. Because the whole game got a lot bigger.

San Andreas isn’t just big, it’s extremely big – with three entire cities to explore and two huge open areas between the cities with smaller towns in them. The focus on the story became even bigger than in Vice City, with characters being more “real” and stories becoming far more complex. This, along with the drive for “realism” and “simulations” defined almost everything Rockstar has done since and… I can’t say I like it.

The game is way too big. Territory wise, it is a pain to get from one part of the world to another, even if you use public transportation options that are supposed to speed it up. Missions are exceedingly long at times, and it’s pretty common to have a huge chunk of the mission being just the very long and boring drive to where something important actually happens. Failing the missions, because of that, was extremely frustrating in the original versions, but at least in The Definitive Edition you get mission checkpoints you can restart from that are relatively generous.

And even the story, that starts off so well, meanders with plots that go nowhere for the entirety of the middle part of the game. Where after a genuinely well delivered opening chapter you get thrown into never ending pastiches of different movie genres, missions that have nothing to do with said good opening chapter. And while they often have good characters and moments of their own, it leads to muddied storytelling where by the end of the game, when things finally go back to the actual plot, you don’t even care anymore. Especially when the game forces you to go through extremely boring “gang wars” system for at least an hour to even get the privilege of unlocking the final mission.

Which is another frustrating thing about the game. Some missions could require you to just grind a skill to even get it. Or waste some time, because they only start during certain time. Or force you to go through the stupid flight school, only to then have just 3 or 4 missions where this is required, and the missions are easier than the school. Also why is there a boat school in the game, if there is no boat skill and no missions that benefit from it?.. Just, so much pointless bloat and annoyances that were simply absent in Vice City. Which, while far from perfect, was a far “purer” experience as a result, a game that just wanted to be fun.

Still, it’s not like the systems are bad, or the characters and stories aren’t interesting. There are wonderful performances, genuinely good writing here and there with some solid jokes and moments that are still entertaining. Sense of style and presentation is still solid, complemented by the great selection of licensed tracks to build the right atmosphere. And when the game works, when you’re not grinding skills because you have to or driving across the entire game world for some nonsensical reason, it’s actually quite fun.

Though it is here where issues of The Definitive Edition are especially noticeable, in comparison with the other two releases. There are countless visual bugs and issues – holes in geometry, incorrect behavior of particles like fire and smoke (you can be on fire and not even see it if you’re moving in a vehicle), jetpack lacking animations (yes, despite the push for realism, SA still had a lot of silly stuff). But more importantly, there are gameplay issues too – in most gang wars enemies have incorrect path finding and often run away from you, for example. Cars and pedestrians can behave closer to how erratic they were in GTAIII, which was somewhat lessened in SA originally. Partially because of how many cars and pedestrians could spawn at once – now a lot of them can spawn, often in large groups in one single spot, which negatively affects missions. Especially since the opposite can happen too and for no real reason missions that require you to have a vehicle quick at hand suddenly forget to spawn any around… It’s a mess. A playable mess, but one that has more issues than the original release did, for all of the faults that original PC port had.

But who knows, maybe someday Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition will get updated to the fully playable state and at that point and will entirely surpass the original release in desirability. And when that happens, I am still never replaying it again. I didn’t dislike my time with it and some of the updates (especially the checkpoints) made the experience even better than one I had with the original two decades ago. But I still can’t say that it was very enjoyable or fun and I’d rather replay Vice City again. If you’ve never played San Andreas before, I feel like it’s worth trying and The Definitive Edition has by now became a solid choice. But I wouldn’t recommend it as an introduction to GTA series.",1745868406,1539.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

➖Radio stations aren’t as good as VC

[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
The game world here expertly combines three distinct cities based on the U.S. cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The map is absolutely massive when compared to GTA3 and VC. Furthermore, since size isn’t everything, the quality of the world is much better than GTA3, and easily comparable to VC. It’s the same level of love where VC emulates Florida, you really feel the distinct differences in the various locations here. 

The narrative is a bit disjointed. It starts heavily focused on a gang war, but quickly expands into cartels and triads spanning across multiple cities. There are some interesting elements of [spoiler]betrayal[/spoiler], but really there are so many irrelevant missions that the game could probably easily eliminate 50% of the missions and have a better, more focused, story. 

[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
SA stands out from the other PS2 GTA’s due to the skill system and a lot of customizable looks for Carl. There is a skill for everything - shooting, driving (car/bike), running, muscles, underwater breathing, ect. I really liked this RPG-esque system, and I don’t think this is something that is continued on to further GTA games, at least to the extent in SA. 
Aside from the skill system, you have a plethora of activities in the game, much more than GTA3 or VC. Most of these are not deep systems, but are nonetheless side activities that can provide some entertainment and currency. Things like firefighting, paramedic, police, and taxi, all make a return from VC. New things are things like gang wars, character customization (tattoos, hairstyle, clothes), car mods, swimming and diving, basketball, pool, arcade machines, dating, and car collection. It's just nuts how many activities SA has. 

Difficulty I would say is slightly easier than previous GTA games, but you still have major issues with healing or armor. Some missions (Looking at you RC copter/Supply Lines) are just awful, and not necessarily true difficulty related, more like the controls are still awful. Definitely the most approachable of all the PS2 GTAs, but still some rough edges. 

[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]
Graphics seem to be similar to the others in the PS2 trilogy. Nothing really stands out from the rest, looks great. 
On the technical side, oof. Still so many issues with NPCs or cars falling through the ground, cars appearing out of nowhere directly in front of you CONSTANTLY after using the R3 look behind function, and I’m not sure if this is intended, but there are police EVERYWHERE. It's stupid. I stole a car at a random stoplight in the middle of the San Francisco city and had 2 foot cops and 2 cars on me INSTANTLY. I think in the remaster, they must have increased the NPC/car clutter, but did not alter police presence, so it's a bit ridiculous. This is something I didn’t notice in VC or GTA3. 
i9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | Windows 11 installed on SSD 

[h1] [b] Audio – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
Sadly, in my opinion the soundtrack in SA is much worse than VC. The radio is always something special in GTA games, and in the original trilogy, VC is by far the best, which is a small shame because I grew up in the 90’s, but SA’s radio only has a handful of good songs. 
Other than music, I feel like the NPC chatter is much less than GTA3/VC, which is good, as it's quite obnoxious there. 
The voice acting at the beginning just sounds like awful quality, like it was recorded in a garage. I didn’t notice it after you got out of the first city, but at the beginning, it was very jarring. 

[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
From many of the systems I mentioned in the gameplay section, I feel like SA has the most replayability of the original trilogy. There’s a ton of optional things to do spread out across a huge map. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
This is my first time playing San Andreas (SA). I was immediately impressed by the world of Los Santos (Los Angeles). While the number of missions were a bit excessive, and the rewards questionable, the constant trickle of fun gameplay systems, like gang wars, were some great fun. 

For my biggest negative, I would say it's still the awful controls and technical issues present in the “Definitive” edition. It’s understandable that a game from the PS2 era, back in the early 2000’s, doesn’t fully translate well to modernized controls, but it also doesn’t make it any easier to play. I wish more emphasis was put on fixing technical issues and controls instead of the graphics. One of the missions where you control an RC plane (Supply Lines…) was one of the worst missions I have ever done in any of the original GTA games (though almost every mission in GTA3 was awful), and it was purely because of the horrible controls. Even VC has a better RC helicopter mission that wasn’t as nearly as painful. 
Add in the numerous technical issues that I listed above, and SA can be very frustrating to play at times. 

As for my biggest positives, I would say it’s the RPG-like skill system and the tri-city game world. The RPG skill system is fun to build your character and see Carl visually improve from consistently doing relevant activities. I really wish this was kept and expanded upon in future GTA games, it’s cool to see your character grow based upon the choices you make, Fable comes to mind as another good example of this. 
And for the game world, I enjoyed the diversity of the three main cities. Each had their own look and feel to them - from the urban war-torn streets of Los Santos, to the trolly-laden hilly roads of San Fierro, to the desert area of Las Venturas, the world of SA is great and fun to explore. 

Overall, I did enjoy playing San Andreas for the first time, but I didn’t finish it. I got about ~70 missions into the ~100 mission game and stopped. Why? I got to the point where I was forced to complete the flying school in order to continue on with the main missions and decided I was good. If I had the ability to change flight inversion then perhaps I would have finished it off, but overall I did have fun and enjoy playing SA.

1547000,True,"This review is from my personal experience with the game and completing it to 100% as well as all of the 4 schools at 100% and it might resonate with what other people think as well. Please note this is an experience that i've had while playing with a keyboard and a mouse and the controls I've mentioned and personally used might be different compared to what other people use as their controls. I could talk more about it but i forgot some of the points i wanted to mention. I have left the comments on for my review, just in case this blows up.

1. I was initially pushed off from buying the game when it came on sale, considering its history wasn't so great. However, i heard a lot of the issues were fixed, so i bought the game anyways. At the moment of writing this GTA The Trilogy means you are buying three remastered games - GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City and GTA III. When i actually started playing the game myself, i could instantly tell the game was originally made to be used with controllers as the camera controls simply sucked. Nothing that an easy search on the internet can't fix though. Now the camera was as controllable as in the original game. Apart from one crash with Unreal Engine, i had no issues at all. The graphics were simply amazing but it was the fact that i was able to play a retro game in 60 FPS that amazed me. Overall, it feels like i'm playing the original game, i personally didn't even notice that i was playing the remastered version while doing some certain missions and i'm not sure if this is a good thing or not. I mean, this is supposed to be feeling like the original game and currently, at the moment of writing this review it's doing that job decently, with just some problems.
2. What surprised me was the fact that you are now able to retry the mission from the last point you were instead of having to completely restart it which was the case in the original game is amazing and it quite ironically gave me the confidence i needed to have to use the retry mission feature as few times as possible. What i also liked is the autosprint on the bike, you no longer have to spam the W button to make CJ ride the bike faster but i believe this should've been a feature to be toggled from the settings as this means you cannot ride the bike normally as in the original game either. The Forklift, the Dozer and the Tow Truck are all easier to use, as instead of having to press the numpads, you can simply press a button and it will for example lower the bar or raise it easily. Which i also think should've been a toggleable feature because you cannot freely control it anymore unlike the original game. Maybe you wanted to do cool things, i don't know. What is completely annoying to me are the hydraulics, you can only adjust them and not play with them anymore, you basically can't do the nice dances while going with the car like you could do in the original game. I hope this gets fixed.
3. The graphical issues still seem to be hiding in some places of the game. To be completely honest, i didn't really notice them apart from when i was in some certain areas in Las Venturas (particularly in the sand near the motorway) and while going with a Mountain Bike on Mount Chiliad. The textures on Chiliad compared to the collisions are so distanced that you can even hide CJ in some certain places. This isn't bothering me much, but it's still an issue. Do you care about Marco Forelli? You likely don't, so didn't the developers because he's that one character that was completely forgotten. His textures are still from the original game, but you won't notice that as you kill him from a distance anyways, unless you use a sniper rifle and you zoom in or you really go near him to have a chat, remember he isn't friendly at all. In some parts there are still blades of grass floating, but it's not as bad as it was before. A funny glitch worth mentioning that appears only in the Definitive Edition and not in the original game is a random NPC that does nothing but spawns in the middle of the road near to where the San Fierro gym is. Whenever i went near there i always made sure i'd kill that NPC, for me it stopped spawning when i was finished with the completion of the three export lists so.. maybe it is related to it? Speaking of glitches, it seemed like my export list was already progressed with one car, meaning when i came to the third and last list and i exported what it seemed like the 9th vehicle from the third list, i got the mission passed song, achievement and i have had 30 out of 30 cars exported even though on the board it still showed i had the Journey left to export. Despite me thinking this will affect my game progress, i got 100% completion, so this didn't prevent me from completing the game at all. While doing the boat school, the last test awarded me a 4-star wanted level and police after me while doing the test. Still, i managed to do it just fine. Now i am not sure if this is the case in the original game as well because i always did the boat/bike schools only after i finished the plane school. I guess i wasn't supposed to do the boat school while still being in San Fierro. Another visual glitch that isn't that fun is when flying a plane, if it is a little bit damaged and you hide the landing gear then one wheel will still show up and/or flicker.
4. The new attention to detail is a pro as well. For example, the snapshots have permanent purple shadows that are visible on the ground regardless of if you have and use a camera or not. Some may find this useful, especially if you forgot to photograph a snapshot and it's the last one you have. In the original game, you were left with only the snapshot itself - you wouldn't know what snapshot you missed unless you manually checked each snapshot location with the camera. Now of course you can use something like GTASNP and see exactly where's your missing snapshot/gang tag/horseshoe/oyster is but maybe you don't want to do that. During the End of the Line i specifically liked how shooting Big Smoke in his armor with a Minigun did absolutely nothing. As far as i remember, this wasn't the case in the original game and it just shows the purpose of wearing armor more clearly. If any bug that was useful was fixed, it seems like you can't do C-Bug anymore. Left-clicking while holding a gun will now also let you aim it and not just shoot it in a straight line, which is also a great change in my opinion. Sometimes you have to get creative, because some turfs are so small that no enemies will spawn in and you will have to lure the enemies from another territory just to kill them while in that turf to start a gangwar, which i don't remember being the thing in the original game, but either i have played it too long ago that i completely forgot how gangwars work or i have never actually bothered taking all of the gang turfs. But maybe they should fix more bugs, which leads me to point number 5.
5. The controls. Unlike the original game, you are more limited in terms of what you can make the keyboard keys do. As a result, you are going to find the flying controls a hell. I managed to fly a plane just fine but that's because i adjusted my controls to work with a plane, a boat and a normal vehicle. After over 1000 hours in the original game in multiple years of gameplay, i would always forget that there are completely different controls for piloting a helicopter. You'll see what i mean when you try flying the Hydra, since it has both a hover mode and a jet mode. If there's anything i hope gets fixed, it's this. We need better controls for the helicopters. It was a pain flying the helicopters, especially in the air races. Those for me were nothing but pure pain and torture. Still, with pain comes greatness and since i wanted to get 100%, i kept trying and did them anyways.

Is this worth it? Well, yes, it still feels like the original game for the most part. I recommend you wait until a sale comes, which is what i did.",1744895644,3202.0,True,False,False,16,2,0.6878252029418945

1547000,False,"I downloaded and started playing gta:sa the original game today but it kept crashing every 15 mins or so because of the compatibility issiues of the original old game with latest windows and hardware. Since Rockstar does not fix these issiues, I decided to buy the definitive edition. This one did not crash yet. 

The definitive edition is a game designed to be played on both mobile and pc platforms. I am playing it on pc but I see some features in the game that can be useful only for mobile but boring at best for pc such as controls being changed, gym interactions being different...

When it comes to graphics I have never been a fan of very detailed graphics since it makes the game unavailable for an older than average computer. I am more in favor of the story, playability and details in a game which was what I really liked about the original san andreas. Also the vehicles in the definitive edition are very very shiny and reflective for some reason. I think it looks bad.

The definitive edition missions are far more easier than the original game's. Also it is far more easier to gain experience, build muscle, gain stamina, etc.

The AI drivers are still the same. It was one of the few things that I didn't like with the original game and they haven't changed it a bit. AI drivers still can't properly drive around obstacles. 

Overall, It is a bad ""retouch"" of the original game. What needs to be changed hasn't been touched at all and they just gave it a huge graphics buff.

1547000,True,"Still Stealing Cars and My Heart: A Biased Review of GTA San Andreas

Ah, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Just the name conjures up a potent cocktail of nostalgia and the irresistible urge to punch a passing cyclist. Back in my youth, it was the forbidden fruit, the whispered legend on the schoolyard, the reason my homework mysteriously remained unfinished. And guess what? All these years later, it still holds up.

The perpetually misunderstood protagonist, trying to navigate the treacherous landscape of gang warfare and corrupt cops. CJ's journey, from Grove Street grunt to reluctant savior (and occasional jetpack enthusiast), remains as captivatingly chaotic as ever.

The sheer scale of San Andreas was mind-blowing. Three entire cities to explore! Deserts to get hopelessly lost in. My younger self spent countless hours simply driving around, listening to the glorious radio stations (K-DST for life!), and causing low-speed fender benders with bewildered NPCs. Now, I still do that.

And let's talk about the side missions. Taxi driver? Pimping? Vigilante? Firefighter? This game threw more part-time jobs at you than a desperate college student. 

My personal favorite was the train mission – the bane of many gamer's. The sheer frustration of chasing that train, the controller-gripping intensity, the triumphant yell when you finally managed to beat it.

Of course, San Andreas wasn't perfect. The graphics, bless their blocky hearts, haven't aged like fine wine. CJ's running animation still looks like he's perpetually trying to outrun a particularly aggressive swarm of bees. And the dialogue? Let's just say it's a time capsule of early 2000s slang that makes me cringe and chuckle in equal measure.

But these imperfections are part of its charm! They're the endearing quirks that remind me of a simpler time, a time when my biggest worry was whether I could afford a lowrider with hydraulics and enough nitrous to launch me into the stratosphere.

So, is GTA San Andreas still one of my favorite games? Absolutely. It's more than just a game; it's a nostalgic hug in digital form, a reminder of youthful rebellion and countless hours of glorious, pixelated mayhem. Sure, modern games might have prettier graphics and more realistic physics, but none of them have captured the same sense of freedom, the same sheer unadulterated fun of cruising down Grove Street, radio blasting, with a stolen firetruck.

If you've never experienced the glorious chaos of San Andreas, do yourself a favor and dive in. Just be prepared to lose a few hours (or days) to the siren call of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas. And maybe, just maybe, you'll find yourself reminiscing about it just as fondly in a couple of decades. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear a damn train that needs chasing.",1744469574,3916.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.5490716099739074
1547000,True,"I love the original GTA Trilogy titles. When they announced this ""definitive edition"", I thought these games would be at the level of GTA 5 graphics. I pre-ordered this on Rockstar Games Launcher as soon as it was possible, on PC. And then, as all of you should know... on the launch day Rockstar Games blocked the access to the game for some couple of days. But that's not what I want to talk about.

A lot of people keep reporting bugs to the game, especially GTA San Andreas (DE). And while I do agree you can notice lots of them during gameplay, I really don't bother at all. The first time I got to actually play the whole GTA SA story, I did it on the PS3 ""remastered version"" from Grove Street Games. I had lots of fun on that ""shitty version"" on my PS3, because I never bothered to actually play the game on PS2 or on PC. Because I was too young when it came out on PS2 and because I had PS3 till 2017.

Anyways, I played the whole story of GTA SA on the PS3 remastered version back in 2016. And today, I started the story again on the GTA SA definitive edition. Boy, so much nostalgia. Just noticed some few broken things, didn't affected any of my gameplay at all. So yeah, I actually tried to install lots of mods on the ""normal"" GTA SA for PC, but lots of errors along the way.

I really hope this post helps some people to understand that this ""definitive"" version is playable and enjoyable, while still messy lots of times.

1547000,True,"Like the first two remasters in the collection, it's a debatable upgrade over the original release, if at all. But I do appreciate that they've stuck with this game and updated it so it's now at an acceptable place in terms of performance and visuals. The colours are no longer drab and the sky actually has that distinct San Andreas flair to it again.

It's not too buggy, some things are a bit broken such as textures being AI upscaled and looking incorrect, seams in character models that weren't there before, and performance dips; But overall it's a robust version of the game that saves you having to locate the delisted original and mod it substantially (Still would have been nice to give people the option...)

The new lighting effects are still quite nice, although I think they were best shown off in Vice City. In both this game and GTA III it feels less effective. There's something weird about seeing such stark, accurate lighting in a game with very basic world detail. The new controls, map and radar system are all still excellent additions, even if it's not as much an impressive addition as it was for III.

There is also the option to play with the original PS2 color palette. The story is about the murder of the MC's mother, the war between gangs and corrupt policemen. All the cars, boats, helicopters and even planes feel great to drive. There are guns for each situation and you can get better at using.

1547000,True,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition is a pretty good game

+Graphics(It really looks good in terms of graphics, just like GTA 3 and Vice City.)
+Gameplay(The gameplay mechanics are the same, but like GTA 3 and Vice City, you can choose between modern or classic.)
+Story(the story is the same, only now the cutscenes are much more detailed)
+Open World(The world is much more detailed and seems to have more life, especially with the classic lighting that has been reintroduced.)

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition is the last in the classic trilogy, remade with modern graphics, and the story in this game is very well told.

In some places they managed to fix this version, but as I said, the rest of the trilogy still needs patches.

In conclusion, a good trilogy that suffered a lot due to bad releases and managed to ruin its reputation.

But now this trilogy is being repaired.

10/10 Must Play! I recommend buying at a discount.

1547000,True,"I was a kid when the original San Andreas came out, and I remember desperately trying to scrape money together to be able to get it from my local video store as soon as they got a copy of it. From the first time I played it, it's always been a very special game near and dear to my heart, and to this day it's still easily one of my favorite games of all time. The Definitive Edition of San Andreas is an especially complicated game for me to review, and it's probably the most I've ever wanted a ""both recommend and don't recommend"" option. 
 
Getting the most important and obvious points out of the way: the ""Definitive Edition"" of San Andreas is inferior to the original in every single way, and under no circumstances should it be anyone's first exposure to the game. Play the true original on PS2 and Xbox, play the not Definite Edition versions available on PS4 or Xbox One, or find some other *ALTERNATIVE* method to play the original game on PC, just whatever you do, do NOT let this be this version be your first time in San Andreas.

That being said, if you've already played the original and know how the game is meant to be, this version can be enjoyable. I played this when it first came out through Xbox Gamepass and it was borderline unplayable. Constant bugs and crashes almost ended my run in Las Venturas when my save was corrupted for no conceivable reason, but after repeatedly attempting to brute force load the save, I managed to recover it and finish my playthrough. I would never recommend anyone play the game in that state, but it seems in the past couple of years, the game has received enough patches to be more or less functional now, and if you don't mind how ugly it can be or how soulless it is compared to the original, I can honestly say it's fun enough to be worth picking up on discount. Breaking it down into the pros and cons:

THE PROS:
- There are quality of life improvements here and there, the biggest of which being checkpoints. I don't care if you're the biggest San Andreas fan in the world, you know full well there are some frustrating missions that you could end up failing at the last possible second for a reason as simple as you took a turn too hard in the wrong place and ended up rolling a car you needed for the mission. Now, instead of having to go all the way back to the mission start point and doing it over from the beginning, the game immediately gives you the option to restart from your last checkpoint (or if you haven't reached a checkpoint yet, it at least lets you restart the mission right from where you are.) There are some other features that some people may argue are QoL improvements and some may argue homogenize the game with GTAV, like how you can slow down time to bring up a weapon wheel on foot or bring up a radio station wheel in the car. It's worth pointing out that you can't carry multiple weapons like GTAV or see the name of the song and the band playing in the car, so these features exist more for convenience than anything else.
- This is a pro and a con in and of itself, but playing this version of the game will probably be the quickest and most accessible way for most people, as Rockstar has all but eliminated all legitimate options for buying the original version of the game through Steam. If you want to play San Andreas but CBA to get the original through any means, here you go.
- The game has achievements. It's hardly a pro, but I know some people live and breathe just for the ability to get achievements in games.
- Family sharing. Unlike most Rockstar games, the Definitive Edition Trilogy allows family sharing, so only one person in your family sharing group actually needs to pick it up in order for you all to be able to play it. 
- It's San Andreas. Even in a vastly inferior form, it's still one of the greatest open world games ever made. You can notice each and every problem with this game and still be able to have fun while playing it.

THE CONS:
- AI upscaling. It's no small secret that the Definitive Edition Trilogy was not handled directly handled by Rockstar and was instead outsourced to the team that was responsible for making the phone ports of the games. This was not the work of some massive studio with an illustrious track record, the console and PC ports were all slapped together by the mobile boys, and the cut corners and lack of effort are noticeable almost immediately in the character models and text. You'll notice that vanity plates on cars like The Truth's van will be jumbled up nonsense in cutscenes, and many player models will enter the uncanny valley with paper thin elbows and disgustingly long alien arms. How this got past any kind of QA testing or review, I'll never know, but my best guess is that it was noticed and simply nobody cared. 
- Bugs/broken segments. As I stated in the pros, this game has been patched more than a Hot Topic denim vest, and STILL there are bugs a plenty. I've noticed way less game breaking bugs, but there will still be NPC cars that suddenly break their pathing during missions, characters that don't load into cutscenese correctly that end up completely freezing the cutscene, cars and characters that will load stuck halfway into the ground or a wall, enemies and vehicles that will either take too much damage or not enough damage for seemingly no reason (i.e. vehicles that will explode from one or two bullets when neither hit the gas tank), stealth sections where you'll immediately be spotted even when hiding and not in the sight line of a guard, and the list goes on.  
- A lot of the charm of the original game has been lost. In the interest of modernizing and """"""remastering"""""" the game, it's clear that efforts have been taken to make certain things look more realistic or to add more modern graphics effects, which ends up completely trampling on the art style and soul of the original game. It wouldn't look bad per se if it wasn't trying to be San Andreas, but in the context of calling itself the Definitive Edition of San Andreas, it's a massive downgrade. 
- Sweet Johnson is still in the game. This isn't a legitimate criticism of the Definitive Edition, I just hate Sweet more than anything. He's one of the worst characters in modern fiction and exists only to drag CJ down, I will not be elaborating further.

All in all, I'd give this version of the game a 6/10, compared to the original being an easy 9/10. Again, I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT PLAY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THE ORIGINAL GAME. This is a game that can be played and enjoyed, but introducing someone to San Andreas with this game is like choosing to introduce someone to Fallout by having them start with 76. You're getting the McDonald's version of a high class steak dinner, and both you and San Andreas deserve better than that.

1547000,True,"GTA: San Andreas – Definitive Edition allowed me to relive my childhood memories and replay a game where I spent dozens of hours as a kid. In a way, this game shaped me – from its portrayal of American gang culture to its music, movie references, and humor.

And you know what? Even in 2025, a lot of these elements still hold up.
Los Santos still feels alive, and it's easy to lose yourself in it.
The story of CJ and the people around him is engaging and immersive – it makes you want to push forward. Sure, it’s not perfect, there are pacing issues and filler missions, but nothing that completely ruins the experience.
Soundtrack? Iconic.
The city? Still feels alive.
Story? Still great.

GTA: San Andreas is one of those games that you just have to experience.

The Graphics
Unfortunately, Definitive Edition looks bad. In some cases, even worse than the original.
And what’s even crazier? Sometimes it looks worse than GTA III and Vice City (Definitive)!
The biggest issue? Colors and textures. The so-called ""remaster"" left everything looking flat, plastic, and soulless.
It’s like a beautiful actress deciding to get way too much plastic surgery after turning 50. The facelift is obvious – and not in a good way.

Gameplay & Mechanics
In terms of mechanics, Definitive Edition plays exactly like GTA III and Vice City.
There are a few extra features, but they don’t actually change the experience (like muscle stats or weapon skill levels – cool to have, but you can ignore them entirely and still beat the game).
The biggest problem? Gunplay and aiming.
For a game where shooting is one of the main mechanics, it feels clunky and frustrating.

Is It Worth Playing?
If you have never played San Andreas, then it’s still worth experiencing.
But if you’ve already played the classic GTA: San Andreas, then… this version adds nothing new.
GTA III and Vice City needed the Definitive Edition because the originals were hard to go back to (hardware issues, bad controls, ancient graphics). But San Andreas? It didn’t need this remaster. This is just an excuse to resell the same 20-year-old game at full price. Don’t fall for it.


TL;DR
GTA: San Andreas is a game that everyone should play –  FOR ITS STORY, for understanding memes, and for the cultural impact of the series. An absolute must-play for any gamer.
However... technically speaking, the game feels very old – sometimes even unbearably so.
If you've played the original GTA: San Andreas, then Definitive Edition is NOT worth it. Don’t buy it.

1547000,True,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the defining moment of the GTA series. The GTA that ""had it all"". I was only in primary school when I started San Andreas and to this day, oh man... it's arguably still the my favourite/THE BEST GTA game to exist. I know, I am going to get crucified for saying that by the GTA fanboys but they will never know what it was like to play a GTA game that was not ""full of itself"". 

Here I am, 26 (almost 27) writing a review for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition. Is the definitive edition of San Andreas worth playing now? especially after all those horrible issues and... CJ having no neck? Is it worth it? Well, below I will let you know but first, a quick disclaimer!

[b] This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on. [/b] 

[h1][b] That feeling of Nostalgia [/b][/h1] 
We all know CJ's infamous line and to hear and see it again after almost 19 years of my life... man... it just brings happy memories flooding back  - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438245402 

Then, while playing San Andreas you get to visit a familiar location from memories past, Marco's Bistro from Grand Theft Auto III. This might not mean much to some but this was a hit and a half - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442177183

We all know that saucy loading screen that, SOMEHOW, always came on when our parents or an adult walked into your room - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3438245263 

[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] 
⚫Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (or Definitive Edition) had, arguably, the best characters in video-gaming history. If you mentioned to someone CJ, Big Smoke, Ceasar.. or heck, Ryder... they would know it is San Andreas. How connected, how in depth, just how... expertly written these characters are is mindblowing.
⚫The story for GTA: San Andreas is unforgettable. The moment you start of the plane, getting picked up and harassed by corrupt, crooked cops... till that moment of betrayal that turns into revenge. The story will have you hooked from the very start and, If I remember correctly - it's also based on real life events.
⚫Rockstar have HEAVILY optimised and worked on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition since it's launch. I have avoided it for a long time due to some MAJOR issues with this version of San Andreas. 
⚫Bridges are where they should be and you no longer need to be Indiana Jones to find them. Neck's are where they should be and muscles are properly defined now (I wonder what I mean) and the Fog has fully returned to San Andreas!!! Stephen King would be proud!!
⚫There is so much to do in San Andreas - Racing. Stadium events. Quarry missions. Trucking missions. Paramedic, Vigilante and Firefighter missions. Courier missions and just so much more. Go, explore and see what else is out there!!
⚫You can conquer the map in helicopters, jets, boats, cars and bikes. It's up to you to decide CJ's path and when you finally conquer all the gang territories, THE HOOD IS YOURS!!!
⚫I did not lag, freeze, crash, stutter e.t.c once. I was running at MAX settings on a 4090 and not a single issue was encountered. 
⚫The soundtrack is amazing. 
⚫The controls now match GTA V. So you get the weapon wheel. It also brings improved gunplay and targeting too.
⚫You also get upgraded graphics, high resolution textures for cars, vehicles, weapons, environment e.t.c.
⚫The mini-map has been upgraded to allow the players to set waypoints... this was sorely needed.
⚫You now get a checkpoint/restart system. This, for all 3 games, is a lifesaver and timesaver.
⚫They made changes to the 100% requirement such as - removing the $999,999,999 need. You don't need to do all 70 stunt jumps. No need to max all your skills. No need to get GOLD medal on all the ""school missions/tests"". 

[h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1] 
⚫There are locations on the map that has not been fixed. I have went INTO mountains, walls and other locations because the terrain is ""floating"" above the actual terrain. Really Rockstar? Really. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3439861353

I really cannot think of anything else negative to say about this.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
After coming from the OG games way back in my childhood and not playing them until now... this was a blast from the bast. A true hit of nostalgia. 

I have avoided the Definitive Edition for almost 2 years due to it being plagued with issues and poor optimisation but now, in 2025 the Definitive Editions of GTA have finally earned their name and I would whole-heartedly recommend one of the best, if not, THE BEST, GTA of all time to anyone!!!

1547000,True,"It's been about 10 years (or more) since the last time I played it.

I think the graphical style is a big improvement over the original while still keeping its artistic identity and adding some variety/improvements to things like NPCs and lighting. However, some aspects feel neglected because it's basically just a graphical upscale on a different engine, and there are certain issues, like annoying stuttering, despite having a high FPS.

The gameplay is very crisp and probably better than the PS2 version, and they improved the audio as well so the guns sound more clear when they fire.

You really connect with the protagonist and want him to succeed, something that I didn't feel for Claude in GTA III. Almost all the side characters are great and feel like the contribute to the story by a lot.

The game in general is very good for nostalgia or newcomers. RECOMMENDED!!!
But there are some negative things:
 *- It's the most unpolished remake in the trilogy.
 *- Turfwars gang members will run away from the area instead of fighting CJ in some waves.
 *- Some enemies in the campaign are buggy.
 *- Trucking's side missions timer doesn't work.

1547000,True,"Comfort-food type of game that is full of character and is just a vibe to play.

Game was pretty rocky when it launched in 2023 but they've since released patches that make it look and run a lot better. Definitely still a remake of a 20+ year old PS2 game but it looks like how you remembered it growing up. 

I only played it at friends' places growing up so I don't have a super deep recollection of the original art style compared to the original, but it still just has a nostalgic aura in the gameplay, music, and everything.

They don't make games like this anymore, so might as well give this classic a spin. Grove street for life.

[h1]Look how they massacred my game[/h1]
GTA San Andreas hit PS2 over 20 years ago. It was an incredible game with a huge map to explore and so many, many things to discover and do. A stellar cast, great dialogues and insanely funny radio programs along with a fun rest of the OST made it a worthy successor to Vice City and 3. Still better than IV and V btw. Unfortunately time hasn't been the kindest to the PS2 trilogy and the originally sold on Steam ports were so subpar that you needed extensive modding just to get them to work with an x-box controller.

The Definitive Edition launched to well deserved ridicule for its myriad issues and hideous butchering of the character models. A few years on and some fixes  and you do have a good, playable game. Still a crime against humanity on the character models though. But it's one of the best PS2 games with some much needed QOL improvements for the longer missions especially.

[h1]Unfixed issues and enhancements[/h1]
Unfortunately, while the DE does a lot of things right, some of the oldest issues in the game still were not fixed, like Woozie walking to the gate in Mountain Cloud Boys and then refusing to budge. Or invisible flames during End Of The Line. Or the exceeding difficulty to get enough Ballas to spawn near the motel to initiate the gang war to take over that spot. It really shows that Rockstar doesn't care with how little effort they put into the game. 

On the positive side though, I learned about the driving school in Las Venturas. It didn't use to show up on the map in the PS2/PC editions. The dance minigame is also far more doable since the symbols are no longer a muddy shadow on the screen.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
GTA: San Andreas is still a great game. I just wish that it was given a better remaster than this shitestorm edition that makes many beloved characters look like they escaped from Baldi's Basics. The damn Rockstar Launcher is also a major drag on the enjoyment factor, as it borks out easily. But if it's on sale... get it.",1739653323,2362.0,True,False,False,9,3,0.5452903509140014

1547000,False,"I loved this game growing up. I have probably come back to San Andreas up to 4 times in my life, just because I loved it so much. Combined with the remake, which absolutely butchers textures on an already kind of sloppily modeled game, I may be coming into a harsh reality. San Andreas is bad. So many early missions are frivolous set up missions teaching you how to eat, get a hair cut, work out, buy guns, shoot, use spraypaint, use a bicycle...the list goes on. And then you are faced with missions where the intention is to have long drawn out chases, even though you can catch and kill a normal enemy much faster, so the game ignores your damage. Meanwhile the characters you are brought together with are entirely unlikable. Spoilers for a game old enough to drink. Your friends betray you, and despite taking over the rest of the world, your brother only ever thinks you are worthless, making you feel like your actions were meaningless. Side quests and collectibles are ramped up into the hundreds, including pearls at the bottom of the ocean, making it a chore to find everything and the rewards too few to be worth it. Now do I recommenced passing on this game? If you have an old version you can still play, Id say yes, pass on it. The remake is in an awful looking state, looking distinctly worse than both of it's predecessors, I mean the mouths don't even move on ultra settings. But if it's your first time or you have no other way to play it, it's worth picking up. I wish more effort went into the biggest of the original trilogy, but I guess we are where we are with this game, and we wont see an update to it ever again. MAYBE modding the game would be worth it, except form what I see, Rockstars launcher may brick your game until you remove certain mods.",1739249341,109.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.5130077600479125
1547000,True,"As of 2025, this game is def worth it on a 20 dollar sale for San Andreas alone, the classic lighting really makes this game pop like the OG.
With that said, this game still has some technical issues, and minor art style choices I disagree with, like occasional black spaces appearing when flying up high, but besides that, the only other minor complaint would be sometimes the NPCS driving during missions would act very stupid. The art style is also something I dislike, as they made some of the characters intentionally cartoon like. I personally think this is childish, because when you play the OG game, the characters don't look goofy like they do in this definitive release, and I think thats a disservice to the original art style. The aiming on controller is a little weird, as the OG game had a very specific lock on system that is no longer present (unless you turn on classic aim). Also very unacceptable that all the music is not in this game, some of the songs were cut for licensing issues I assume, but that's still unacceptable. Also don't like the fact I need to have a Rockstar account to play a game from 21 years ago 

Since this is just San andreas, Here's the plot summary from my OF San Andreas review.
Grand Theft Auto: Set in 1992, ""San Andreas"" follows the story of Carl Johnson, commonly known as CJ, who serves as the second-in-command of the Grove Street Families gang. For the past five years, he had relocated to Liberty City, distancing himself from his life in the gang. This choice stemmed from the tragic murder of his younger brother, Brian, which caused a rift between him and his older brother, Sweet—one of the founding members of the Grove Street Families (GSF). Sweet holds CJ responsible for Brian's death, believing he abandoned the family in their time of need. In 1992, Sweet calls CJ revealing that their mother was murdered during a botched hit aimed at him. Upon learning of his mother’s death, CJ returns to San Andreas, determined to rebuild his relationships with his family and old friends.


Besides that, I personally love the modernized controls, making the definitive edition the new best way to play San Andreas, the Best GTA game. 
10/10 just for being GTA SA
this definitive edition, even with the OG lighting is a 8/10, but the modernized controls really help this release.

1547000,True,"Playing GTA San Andreas from start to finish for the first time, just like I did with Vice City, was an incredible experience. It’s amazing how much this game already had in place back in the day, making it clear why GTA became the giant it is today. The huge open world, the variety of activities, and the detailed world-building all feel like the foundation of what we see in GTA V.

From intense missions to side activities like riding a bike, working out at the gym, or even delivering food, there’s always something to do. The gameplay feels great, and the controls (especially after the latest updates from Rockstar) are smooth and enjoyable.

One of the highlights is the voice acting in the world. Every character feels alive (for what we could have back then), and the performances add so much depth to the already great story.

As for the Definitive Edition, with the latest fixes, it feels like a proper remaster. The lighting effects, particles, and updated visuals breathe new life into the game, making it feel modern while keeping its classic charm. Even by today’s standards, San Andreas is a fantastic game, and this version does it justice.

1547000,False,"The so-called ""Definitive Edition"" of GTA: San Andreas is a disappointing, poorly executed remaster that feels more like a low-effort mobile port. Many mechanics have been stripped down or simplified, and the game still suffers from numerous bugs and performance issues despite patches. Worse, Rockstar removed the original version from the Steam store, leaving this as your only option.
------------------------------------------------------
🔹 Story Quality:
The story is still the classic San Andreas tale we all know and love. It’s the one part of the game that remains intact and enjoyable.

🔹 Story Depth:
San Andreas still has a massive world and plenty of side content, but some features feel neutered in this version.

🎮 Controls:
Simplified mechanics and clunky controls make this feel like a mobile game port. Gameplay is unresponsive and lacks polish compared to the original.

🌍 Immersiveness:
Immersion takes a hit due to the poor visuals, stripped mechanics, and constant bugs. The charm of San Andreas is still there, but buried under a mountain of issues.

⚔️ Difficulty:
The game retains the original difficulty, but bugs and poor controls can make things frustrating for the wrong reasons.

🗺 Level Design:
The map and missions are unchanged, so the level design remains a highlight. Some visual upgrades like lighting are nice, but not enough to save the package.

🎨 Graphics:
AI-upscaled textures look lazy, with inconsistent results across the board. Some visual effects are improved, but character models are laughably bad.

🎵 Sound and Soundtrack:
The classic GTA radio stations are still fantastic, though some tracks are missing. The sound quality hasn’t been improved significantly but holds up well.

🕹 Gameplay:
Stripped mechanics and simplified features make this feel like a dumbed-down version of the original. Bugs and glitches interfere with basic gameplay.

🐛 Bugs:
Despite patches, the game is still plagued with bugs and performance issues. Crashes, texture pop-ins, and other issues ruin the experience.

⌛ Playtime:
20-40 hours if you’re determined to push through it, or less if you give up out of frustration.

🔁 Replayability:
The original was endlessly replayable, but this version’s issues will leave you less inclined to revisit.

💰 Price:
Only worth considering at a steep discount (50%+) and only if you’re fully aware of what you’re getting into.

The Good Stuff:
✅ The classic San Andreas story and characters are still there.

✅ Some lighting and environmental effects look decent.

✅ The radio stations and nostalgic vibes still carry some charm.

The Bad Stuff:
❌ Feels like a mobile port with a fresh coat of paint.

❌ Stripped-down mechanics and simplified gameplay.

❌ Numerous bugs and performance issues remain post-patch.

❌ AI upscaled textures and bad character models are laughable.

❌ Original version removed from the Steam store, leaving this as the only option.
------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
This ""Definitive Edition"" is anything but definitive. It’s a sloppy, poorly optimized attempt at modernizing a classic, riddled with bugs, bad textures, and dumbed-down mechanics. The original version is sadly no longer available, so if you must buy this, wait for a massive discount and be prepared to spend hours modding it to fix its many flaws.",1738749701,60025.0,True,False,False,85,4,0.8358625173568724

1547000,True,"While it is one of the best games of all time, in this Defective Trilogy it suffered the most.

The BIGGEST Cons of the game so far:

The audio even tends to glitch during rain (or thunder) where while shooting, the audio of firearms occasionaly cuts off, while for vehicles, the audio of the vehicles during rain tends to loop unless you exit the vehicle. Vehicles sometimes merge into the ground randomly, Models of the pedestrians tend to glitch when they die sometimes and in one instance, i've seen a cop playing a running animation while on his motorbike. Plus, upon close inspection on CJ's model, texturing is just messed up. Colors clipping here and there, some details become bigger etc etc. In some places, even with 3060 Ti, the game tends to lag for whatever reason. Possibly poor optimization.

And also whoever programmed the helicopter, plane and jetpack steering, as well as how the vehicle camera works: Please take your meds because, whatever the voices in your head told you to do, some of these things just ruin the experience.

Rating: 6.5/10 (Recommended but with mixed feelings)

The game should be played only if you are unfortunate enough to NOT have the copy with the original version of the game and you have no other way to relive experience or play the game for the first time. It's just... Not great.

1547000,True,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Definitive Edition) Review

I’m currently working toward 100% completion, and I have to say—this version of San Andreas has been a pleasant surprise.

I didn’t try this edition until after the Netflix patch last year, and here’s my experience so far:

 No crashes – Stability has been rock-solid throughout.
 Visuals – The game looks great overall, though some cutscene animations can feel a bit off.
 Gameplay – It’s as fun and engaging as ever. Completing 100% is a massive undertaking, with a ton of side content to keep you busy.

If you already own the original, this remaster is still worth checking out. And if you’ve never played San Andreas before, while it might feel a little janky at times, the overall experience is still incredibly fun and has aged surprisingly well.

When I was a kid, my only real experience with the game was driving around on my dad’s save file—I didn’t play the missions much back then. So for me, most of the nostalgia comes from exploring the world itself. This means the game has been mostly a new and enjoyable experience for me.

Random objects that have insane collision on them, noticed this alot on the races, such as San Fierro Hills, where the road posts, are moveable, but if you hit them, you may, or may not, go flying into the water.
Or maybe the more funny ones, if you push an AI off their track in a chase or race, they will do whatever they can to get back to the point they were at.

1547000,True,"GTA San Andreas - A Timeless Nostalgia

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas isn't just a game; it's a gateaway to my childhood - a vivid memory of simpler times. From the moment CJ uttered, ""Ah ....., here we go again,"" I was pulled into a world that felt boundless, where Grove Street wasn't just a place, but home.

Those late nights spent sneaking in one more mission, cruising through Los Santos with 2Pac on the radio - it wasn't just gaming; it was pure magic. I didn't just play the story; I was lived it, customizing cars, exploring deserts, and embracing the chaos that made it all unforgettable.

San Andreas is more than a masterpiece; it's a time capsule of laughter, freedom, and innocence. It reminds me of the GOLDEN DAYS when my heart - a timeless reminder of the joy of being young and free.

Still grateful for those memories, and always will be.

1547000,True,"[b]Another successful period game released by Rockstar Games was San Andreas, the events of the 90s period and the ambience of this environment were very realistic, although the task flow and the logic of some missions are not as successful as Vice City, the general presentation and the well written characters of some characters also save the scenario missions part. The side factors, such as the fact that there are many activities in it, the side missions are generally enjoyable, the satisfactory size of the map makes the game valuable, the 2 most interesting cities of the state of California and Las Vegas are again very realistic in this game. This version has not lost much of the quality of the old one, this game promises to be the most varied of the trilogy. I encountered fewer bugs and lighting problems than in the other two games, so I was able to concentrate more on the side quests and events. The old version was a 10/10 game, and this version is a 10/9 game.

Even 3 years after release is this the perfect remaster? Far from it.

However, none of it was bad enough for me to stop playing and at heart it still felt like GTA SA I know. Some legitimately good improvements is that you can play with a stable 60 fps without experiencing weird bugs like the OG version and the autosave for missions is great.

1547000,False,"You just don't want this. Basically, this is a mobile port version with some graphical ""improvements,"" but many mechanics were simply cut from the game or simplified. Even after a few patches some months ago, this is still an unplayable mess. You need to spend hours fixing and restoring content just to somehow enjoy the game.

The worst part is they deleted the normal version from the Steam store, so you can't buy the original if you want to.

I've played through GTA SA, so I know what I'm talking about. You should only buy it during a big discount (50%+), like I did, and only if you understand what you're buying.

UPD: Woah, that a lot attention to this review, so I will bring more to it here. 

-   Since this is a mobile port, most mechanics have been simplified. For example, the forklift can now only move between maximum and minimum height, which makes the Robbing Uncle Sam mission a pain.

-   The gym minigame is now just a ""spam in the right timing"" mechanic, and it's broken—you can lift the maximum weight from the start.
    Because the code remains the same, missions like Learning to Fly are best skipped using cheats since you can’t hold your breath long enough, and bike riding is worse overall.

-   Speaking of bikes, sprinting has been changed—on bikes, you no longer need to spam a button to go faster, and on foot, you can’t sprint longer distances like in the original.

-   The new ""old"" lighting is nice, but they also brought back the old clouds… what’s the point of this remaster if it’s just reintroducing old visuals and still looks worse?

 -  The launcher still only has GTA San Andreas sounds, fonts, etc., no matter if you're playing Vice City or GTA 3. No legendary loading sounds like before.

-   The character models are worse due to the overly smooth materials, thanks to the mobile port.

And there’s so much more. Some of this can be fixed, but most of it can’t.

In the end, it’s your decision, but I really don’t recommend it. Just yohoho the original from some unknown place—it’ll be a far better experience if Rockstar won’t let us play it properly. Or just rip the PS2 version and play it on an emulator with upscaling, like I’m doing right now.

1547000,True,"San Andreas is the pinnacle of the PS2 era GTA games. It feels like a massive step up from Vice City. It has a ton of systems, mini games and things to check out. The gunplay feels much improved. The story feels better put together. The radio music is well done with a good amount options. CJ is has skills for gun types, driving and some misc skills. I haven't played this game since near the original release and it felt great to give it another play through. 

I will say that in some ways the game is almost too ambitious for it's own good. There's a property system (like in Vice City) but going around to collect the money on the giant map is a waste of time. There's a gang territory system which is cool and mandatory near the end of the game, but for most of the game it is inaccessible. There are lots of story side plots that don't really go anywhere or reach a true conclusion. The biggest criticism is while it is amazing for it's time and still holds up fairly well, it obviously feels quite dated by today's standards for graphics and combat gameplay.

Overall though I think the Definitive Edition of San Andreas is a great option for anyone looking to play the game. It has full controller support for those of us who played on the PS2. It has autosave checkpoints and a mission retry which cuts down on wasting time and having to restock ammo.

I get it, you updated the visuals, graphics, bla bla bla, you made the game more 2020ish, but jesus christ there are some things in this game that are absolutely still awful. 
Let's start with the things that hurt me the most:
- those updated visuals are a fraud. There all a lot of visual bugs: grass floating, asphalt visual bugs at max speed, car visuals are flickering most of the time, npcs texture are hillarious - more awful than in the classic gta sa, gaps between textures etc.. (you will see)
- npcs are still ret****d, in the most difficult missions and in the most important times they just drove in front of you and crash and f**ks up your missions.
- They took out a lot of songs from radio
- they made the game much more easier (not the achievements tho), it's like i'm not even trying to play, besides the imbeciles npcs that are doing their job to f**k your missions up. - gym is a joke, girlfriends system is now easier and not rewarding, you upgrade your weapons after firing them twice (boom HITMAN LEVEL), cars explode much more faster, npcs die instant even shooting them with a simple pistol.
-  flying controls are absolutely awful.
- some achievements were made without thinking straight. You can't do them without spending 200 hours or just downloading a save file from internet.

Good things? Yes, exist.
Still having a lot of fun playing this nostalgic game!!
They added classic light! That's awesome. Sad they needed 300 updates to listen to the community and actually do it. They still need to solve the visual bugs. Then we will talk.

Ok, so i  had completed this game 100% and lemme tell you. It's very hard and it takes patience, sweat & determination to achieve it. It had it's ups and downs cause the game is pretty outdated for today's modern games. Here's the list:
1. Story was damn great. It was better than GTA V that's for sure. 
2. Some of the missions are hard but it was worth it.
3. Side missions are good and some of them are heavily hard such as Trucking (where the cops ram you in such a hard 
    way), Exports & Imports (it took me whole day since some of the cars spawn in different cities like Los Santos & Las 
    Venturas), The Chiliad Challenges (the bicycle are hard to control), NRG-500, Stadium Events (Blood Bowl & Dirt Track 
    almost made me broke my keyboard), Air Races (for me it was Barnstorming) & Unique Stunt Jumps (some of them were

1547000,True,"I played this game before and after (got lucky with timing) of the latest patch, that being said, it is not a God fix to all the issues but at least the game is not terrible as it was on the beginning (when I first played this from a borrowed Switch version)

Positives
+ Game works perfectly fine now, I experienced no bugs when I played the game
+ Characters look good, while not the more serious style they had going on the original, they are serviceable
+ Checkpoints (which will be a positive only because of one of the negatives I`ll mention)
+ The GTA V mechanics added to the Definitive Edition are nice quality of life additions

Negatives
- Music missing and not coming back 
- Plane flying feels worse than original versions (which is why those checkpoints helped)
- Much more aggressive AI, as before you could walk the streets with no one shooting, now Ballas will shoot on sight, during gang wars some extra NPC will appear to erase your health from the back, and police lvl 1 feels at least at lvl 3 aggressiveness at times (not the extra threats of that star lvl)

Steam Deck
As I only play offline mode for steam deck, I can say that it works but it is very troublesome because of the extra safety step of the Rockstar launcher, wouldn`t recommend it if you play offline like me.

1547000,True,"There's a lot of things here that are different than the original San Andreas. Some stuff straight up doesn't work, like the pool minigame. You can't adjust your power so it's unplayable. They changed weight lifting so you don't have to mash anymore, which is fine, but now it's a timing minigame. You can lift the 300lb weights right from the start, so all the other weights are irrelevant. It takes away the feeling of getting stronger. For some reason they kept the walking machine minigame the same, except they removed the bar from the UI, so now you don't know when you're going to fall off. 

When you exit a car you can't leave the door open. You always have to wait for CJ to close the door. They tried to make combat targeting better but they ended up making it much worse. It was originally very easy to transition through targets, but now it barely works. This is something that won't matter if you're using a mouse, but using a controller to aim feels much worse than the original game. 

Cars drive worse than they do in the original. It won't be noticeable to people who haven't played much of the original, but it's very noticeable to me. They also changed the appearance of many iconic pedestrians. I don't understand the reasoning for this at all. A lot of characters are absolutely hideous now. Like Denise, it removes her bandana when you're on a date. It makes her look really odd.


There's a lot of good things though. The reflections are beautiful. The lighting has been fixed and it looks great, There's much less aliasing and pop in. You can control the speed of your vehicle using controller triggers. That's something you couldn't do in the original game. They added a weapon wheel like in GTA5, that's one of the best changes. You can play at high resolutions and there's good graphics settings. They added parallax textures to various buildings so you can see inside of them.

There's a lot of stuff I didn't list. There's many differences between this and the original.

I played the DE on Nintendo Switch and it was awful. Barely ran at 30fps and the controls were horrid. It's much better on PC. This is my preferred way to play San Andreas. Of course it's not as good as the original with mods but it's still fun, it's perfectly playable.

1547000,True,"[b] Pros: [/b]
- Mission Checkpoints: A welcome improvement that makes missions less frustrating by reducing the need to restart from the beginning upon failure.
- Improved Spray Tag Visibility: The colors of spray tags are now more vibrant, making them easier to spot and collect.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- [u] Rhino Tank Camera Issues: [/u] Controlling the Rhino tank feels clunky due to awkward camera angles that make navigation a hassle.
- [u] Helicopter Controls: [/u] The flight mechanics are counterintuitive, making helicopters difficult to control and requiring significant adjustment.
- [u] Mouse Sensitivity Problems: [/u] The mouse sensitivity, particularly the Y:X axis ratio, feels completely off. Adjustments are necessary, often requiring users to double the Y-axis sensitivity to compensate.

[b] Bugs and Glitches [/b]
While the majority of bugs encountered were minor and did not significantly impact gameplay, some did cause occasional disruptions. However, the game does a decent job of preventing major softlocks by teleporting the player a few meters away in critical situations.

[b] Gameplay Bugs: [/b]
- ""Ice Cold Killa"" Mission: Players can get stuck between ledges when entering the building from the rooftop.
- ""New Model Army"" Mission: The helicopter can become trapped below the ground texture if the bridge is dropped incorrectly and then retrieved with the magnet.
- Flying Cars (Rare but Hilarious): Occasionally, vehicles launch through the streets at light speed, smashing everything in their path—mostly occurring during mission-related phone calls.

[b] Other Notable Bugs: [/b]
- Several Fatal error crashes.
- Helicopter explosion sound effects looping indefinitely.
- Hijacked vehicles sometimes become immovable if a passenger attempts to exit.
- Jumping onto a Dinghy from water can cause it to launch across the surface like a missile.

[b] Texture & Visual Bugs: [/b]
- Minimap Issues: Missing player indicators during several boat school missions.
- Grass and Terrain Glitches: Some grass textures float above the ground, and occasional texture seams are visible (similar to the original SA).

[b] Graphical Oddities: [/b]
- Vehicles may sometimes spawn slightly above the ground, floating in mid-air.
- Rare instances of underground cars with only their roofs visible.
- Pedestrians' lower bodies may sink into the ground while walking on stairs.
- Jetpack jets sometimes have glitched or missing animations.

[b] UI and Display Bugs: [/b]
- The GPS occasionally suggests inaccessible routes.
- Important indicators (e.g., girlfriend pick-up points, building entrances) may disappear when in a vehicle.
- Vehicles can vanish suddenly while driving.
- Toggling fullscreen mode off and on results in a persistent black bar at the bottom of the screen.

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]
Despite its flaws, Definitive Edition remains a fantastic experience. It still captures the essence of the original San Andreas, a game that many of us hold dear and reminisce about. While the remaster introduces some technical issues, it does not take away from the nostalgic and immersive experience that made the original a classic.

Especially for those who grew up with San Andreas, this version is an exciting way to relive the adventure. If you can overlook occasional bugs and some control quirks, this remains one of the best open-world experiences in gaming history.

No matter what you do, you can't get that smell, or the look off the walls. You know there's something amazing here, but the previous tenant tried as hard as possible to destroy it.  That's a lot like this attempt at San Andreas. While the game itself is amazing, it really does feel like the developers went out of their way to downgrade it for new players. The Auto-Center is actively hostile to the player when trying to use KB+M, making the game feel like it wants you to stop playing it. Most audio sounds like it was recorded using the original PS2 audio on a TV and an original Sony Walkman, sometimes having more static than understandable audio. The art style has been butchered, covered in a weird, overly clean, clearly mobile reskin, while the models are not really updated at all, so the look is jarring. Even with ""Classic Lighting"" the ""art"" direction for this ""definitive edition"" is just embarrassing, most textures are blurry, or changed to look worse for some reason. It's so sad because what I see underneath all of this ""Definitive Edition"" is a great game, really surprising that anybody allowed them to release this, I would have been embarrassed to have my name associated with something so poor.

However, this is still an older title that brings it up to compatibility for newer machines which I can appreciate.

For my playthrough (I'm at 88% completion on San Andreas), I didn't see or run into anything game breaking. In fact I would say it was a far more enjoyable experience than playing the original. I'm sure if you go out of your way to find them, you will indeed find flaws in the remake but personally that's not why I bought the games.

The initial idea of giving the trilogy a second life was great, but unfortunately for Rockstar Games, it would have been easier to entrust this task to mobile game developers rather than handling it themselves.

In the end, we’re left with a graphically subpar trilogy. The characters look very plastic, and the environment is overly bright (which was corrected in the latest patch, first released on Netflix, then much later on Steam, by the way).

We also regret that the atmosphere of the original games was not faithfully recreated.

So, who should be blamed? Rockstar for delegating to Grove Street Games, or the latter for not putting more effort into their work?

Anyway, there are still plenty of issues to fix. That said, playing the games is still possible, but you should approach them with caution if you're playing for specific reasons.",1734485101,4786.0,True,False,False,64,0,0.7951023578643798

1547000,False,"One of the worst remasters of one of the best GTA games.

+ The most innovative and iconic GTA game there is. There are so many gameplay features its crazy they managed to cram it in one single game in 2004. Its even more impressive this game came out only two years after Vice city which is barebones compared to this one.

You can ride around, listen to radio, complete missions, customise your character in ways never seen before in a game like this - tattoos, clothes, haircuts, you can control your weight. There are races, challenges, driving school, flying, collectibles, parkour, you can pimp your car like in NFS, there are girlfriends you can pursue, martials to learn, weapons to master, exercise, swim, dive, do repeatable content, play as a trucker, medic, taxi driver or a policeman, lead your gang and participate in gang wars, there are stealth mechanics and many many more things. Very impressive. 

+ Immersion in this game is next level, especially for its time. Its always nice to just ride around and listen to the radio or some random conversations NPCs have, look at the posters, customise your character, maybe get fat or muscular and the game will reflect that. There are small things like when you drive around with low skill compared to high skill the animation changes.

+ Map is huge and varied. Every previous GTA game had a city to explore, this one has three and a ton of other interesting areas in between. I love how open this game is and how you can explore so much. 

+ There are some good aspects to the remaster. Checkpoint system is a welcome change as is the increased fidelity and some balance patches.

+ Satire in this game is still excellent. All the jabs at the culture of its time is great and i had a few chuckles here and there. Its worth it to be attentive to the radio, NPCs chatter, posters, even how characters behave and what they wear is reflective of its time.

+ Characters and voice acting are (mostly) great. I really liked Toreno, Tenpenny, CJ, Wuzi and Catalina. Everyone is a bit of a caricature but they all feel like characters with their own agenda and are interesting, again, especially compared to the previous entries in this series.

+  Main gameplay loop is solid. All the mechanics are not amazing on their own but they are solid and there is no obvious weak spot. Moving around, gunplay and riding/driving/flying all feel good. How the hell did they manage to make this game in two years is beyond me.

+ Story is okay, not amazing, but still pretty iconic and i think it does a good job keeping player interested. 


- Controls are simply worse than in the original game. How did they mess this up is beyond me. Camera always auto centers itself which makes driving around anything that isnt a flat surface annoying af. You cant see anything except the back of your car. 

There is no raw input from mouse. Camera movement feels very floaty, both horizontal and vertical speeds are different and cant be matched. This game feels terrible on a mouse and it wasnt the case with the original game.

- Artstyle is completely different and so much worse. Characters look cartoony and therefore very creepy which doesnt really suit the tone of the game. In the original they clearly went with more of a realistic look which got thrown out the window. Colour palette is also completely different. Remastered graphics look oversaturated and cartoony. They just threw the OG artstyle out the window.

- Why do i have to purchase the entire GTA Definitive edition if i am only interested in this one game? Why cant it be bought sepparately and why the hell do i have to use the damn Rockstar launcher with it?

- Visual glitches and bugs are still present. Map is not seamless, there are seams visible everywhere, visual glitches and bugs are still present. Game doesnt run very well on a modern hardware. Visual glitches are also present, this is especially noticable on the road. Dust trails behind cars are super bright and blinding, some textures dont load.

- Songs are missing on the radio that used to be there.


Remaster brings a few improvements but also a lot of downsides. I would honestly prefer if they only increased view distance, maybe upscale the textures and leave the rest of the graphics alone. 

Buy this game only if you want the convenience of checkpoints and some balance patches as those are the only two major improvements this ""remaster"" really brings to the table.",1734441863,1348.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.539170503616333

1547000,True,"GTA San Andreas Is The Best GTA Game Of All Time

While that title seems a bit shocking at first, you have to understand that San Andreas was a close childhood game of theirs while growing up being on the PS2/PS3, Mobile, PC or even the original Xbox launch. I am one of those people who played a lot of this game for the first time through the PC and a bit on Mobile and man, I am so addicted to this game whenever I come back and play it. 

I think the biggest selling factor to me is the story and the map. The story is so interesting with Carl Johnson coming back and bringing Grove Street back to its roots while helping Sweet, Ryder, Big Smoke, Officer Tempeny, OG Loc and many more iconic characters. This is what this game does best, it gives you an amazing story that sticks with you and you actually care about it because its so memorable. The characters and the story itself are amazing but now, let's talk about the map.

Traditional GTA games like Vice City and III utilize a big bridge that connects all three islands together so whenever you would like to visit the other islands, you must take the bridge to get there however, San Andreas incorporates flat lands like farm land, mountains like Mount Chilliad, and open space that makes the map feel more natural and not so much of a hassle to drive around. Instead, with the farmland that surrounds Los Santos gives the map more meaning. You may not never go to all different farms and the mountain for missions but the map being connected with this open space makes it feel natural and honestly, makes the map beautiful. Sure, you still have the highways you can always drive on but sometimes, you can go through the country road or even take a plane across the cities. Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas are all iconic map locations in San Andreas and are all detailed in their own style.

The gameplay is also fantastic. Sure, you may experience a few hitches there and there with some bugs but overall, compared to how the Definitive Edition first released in 2021, Rockstar have done an amazing job with optimizing this game for newer GPU's and have made the game feel more closely to the PS2 era with the Classic Fog and Lighting options in the game. The car driving is smooth and efficient, it's not so much of a hassle like in GTA III, and overall, the gun play and driving is just amazing in its own way.

So yes, I did 100% this game after getting it because it's always been a childhood dream of mine to beat this game and unlock the tank and Hydra that spawn at Grove Street after watching countless videos of tutorials of what you get when beating the game. I've watched stunts, crashes, funny moments from this game and even watched German Let's Play multiplayer videos because this game just never gets old. It's such an iconic game that it deserves to be one of the best video games of all time.

Call me biased, call me stupid, but this is the best GTA game of all time. I'm sure when GTA IV comes out, I'll still feel the same about this game. And what would I give it? 10/10. Everything is amazing, and you won't get bored of it if you're a GTA enthusiast. Even without nostalgia, I'm sure you will make great memories in this game. It is amazing and is just a work of art.

1547000,True,"GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition had a scummy, malicious, rough launch. Now, it has been patched up, lots of terrible models have been swapped out, a classic lighting option was added, and it is finally a decent set of games (GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas), that are playable without feeling like you’ve been abused, though still not the same as the originals.

Pros:

+ Finally received care and fixes for most issues
+ Aesthetically pleasing visual effects to balance out dated graphics (Now with the better Classic Lighting option)
+ Performs as a decent port for PC
+ Additional settings, including options for aiming, and DLSS
+ GTA: San Andreas is still the best GTA game of all time, with the best vibe and most activities, as well as skills to build up, each with benefits at higher levels. Also most dialogue, best music, funniest humor and most things to do.
+ Mod support with easy install process

Cons:

- Original soundtrack is lacking due to licensing issues. Most notable is Sam Andreas unfortunately. (It is restorable with mods).
- Controller UI is only for Xbox. (PS and other controller UI can be added with mods).
- Some character and object models are still in need of replacement
- Poorly made missions and elements that sometimes prevent you from completing missions have not been fixed, especially notable in Gta 3.
- Political censorship is present (Hypocritical with original point and satire of the series)
- Requires Rockstar Launcher
- Rockstar no longer has originals for sale.

As you can see, it’s not the same, nor as good as the originals, and definitely not what the legacy deserves. Though as the originals are no longer on sale, this is finally a decent option for those who don’t have the originals, as it is finally close to great and have easily installable mods that can do the rest of the heavy lifting.

1547000,True,"After the latest update, GTA: San Andreas - Definitive Edition has finally received some of the improvements fans have been waiting for. Rockstar introduced a ""classic lighting"" option, bringing back the warm tones and atmosphere of the original 2004 version. This fixed the previously criticized ""cold"" and ""muddy"" visuals, restoring the aesthetic charm that made the game iconic. Now, the game looks much closer to the original, which will surely please longtime fans.

However, despite numerous fixes, several issues remain. Black seams between texture layers are still visible, breaking immersion. Grass often doesn’t blend correctly with the terrain, and grass textures can even appear on asphalt. Water splashes look outdated and unnatural. Lighting also changes abruptly at times, especially during storms, which can feel jarring.

The game is plagued by ugly text and textures where the use of AI upscaling is far too obvious. LODs for objects like grass, bushes, cars, and pedestrians load in too quickly, ruining the sense of immersion.

Some features from the original game that added to its charm are also missing. For instance, there’s no visual indicator of a car’s condition, such as white or black smoke from under the hood, making it difficult to tell how much damage the vehicle can take. Objects like streetlights and signs that could be knocked over by cars used to have physics and would disappear over time, but now they simply sink into the ground.

Gunshot sounds are another sore point, as they’re too loud and sharp compared to the rest of the audio balance.

While the improvements make the Definitive Edition more stable and closer to the original, the game still feels unfinished. For those willing to overlook these shortcomings, it’s a decent opportunity to revisit Los Santos. However, Rockstar still has a long way to go to make this remaster truly definitive.",1734180154,5694.0,True,False,False,29,7,0.7120560407638549

This ""definitive edition"" is now far less buggy than the release we got a few years back, but by no means perfect. It's also kind of incredible how unoptimized this game is considering how it looks. I played about 50% of the story on my Steam Deck and it didn't always keep a steady 60FPS, sometimes dropping to the 40-50 range. The other 50% of my time was on my primary gaming PC, but I was shocked how even on max settings how terrible the LOD in the distance was.

But I still recommend the game, because the original PC release was nowhere perfect either. I found it to be buggy and constantly crashing. This re-release has so many quality of life features that really improves the experience. More modern controls, missions now having checkpoints, a weapon wheel, a radio wheel, it really adds up. Look, I loved San Andreas back in the day, but the game was janky enough at times and you would die for the stupidest reasons, leaving you to spend 10-20 minutes again to try restart the mission and get back to the point you were. It added up. At least now I can laugh at the jank and feel like it isn't seriously wasting my time.

Rockstar should have done much better with this trilogy re-release, but I am happy they haven't given up on it and made something at least serviceable.

1547000,False,"I really wanted to enjoy this, but it’s essentially feels like a mobile game port disguised as a remaster. While the lighting updates are impressive, the game feels far too broken to be considered an upgrade from the original GTA San Andreas.

-The game is much easier than the original.
-Gym mechanics no longer factor in your muscle stat.
-What did they do to Denise?!
-Weapon aiming is overly precise and unrealistic.
-Bicycles are faster and no longer require skill progression.
-Fire damage is ridiculously overpowered.
-Car doors don't break easily, before I could punch an ambulance door, now I can't.
-Camera autocenters
-Vigilante missions are bugged (e.g., in Los Santos, I was told to eliminate targets in Las Venturas???).
-The DDR-style gameplay is poorly executed with bad UX design. But the timing is better... I think 
-Vehicles are too weak against bullets, making many missions far too easy.
-Some characters look great, while others are noticeably off.
I genuinely tried to like this version because I love the original game, but this remaster is poorly executed. If you have the option to play the original version, do so. This one isn’t worth it unless you can get it at a 90% discount.

If now it feels like these, even with the updates. How it was when it was released???
 Don't get me wrong, the game looks amazing in many ways and can still be better.
But it doesn't matters if it feels bad.


POST 100% REVIEW:
After trying to refund and being denied, I completed the game 100% to see if it was worth it.

- There are more people on the streets, making it easier to conquer territories.
- The snapshots in San Fierro are much easier to identify.
- The gym is still a joke.
- NPCs spawn randomly on the streets (sometimes it works against you).
- Some parts of the map are misaligned, allowing you to see the infinite void below.
- I didn't like the helicopter controls (personal preference).
- ALL the girlfriends were intentionally given uglier designs.
- Some characters are animated well, while others seem intentionally poorly animated.
- The races are a joke. Either they changed the speed of the player’s vehicles or the opponents’ speed, but ALL the races in the game became trivial. In the original, I had to put in effort and learn the routes—for example, the 8-Track in Los Santos was a challenge. Here, it felt like a formality.
- The jetpack animations feel like they lacked polish. However, there are small details that show they put some time into it.
- Mission-specific achievements are brutal—you either download a save file or replay the game.
- The police used to spawn at a safe distance. Now, they can spawn just steps away from you, which works against you when you're trying to get on a motorcycle or get into a car without doors.
- Some sound effects are missing, like the sound when spraying a graffiti tag.
- Bugs like activating a jetpack in the Los Santos gym (which would take you to an alternate map) or breaking the wall in ""End of the Line"" outside of the mission are gone. (Not necessarily a bad thing, but I liked those bugs.)
- Sometimes red circles do not appear. This bug seems random. 
- Flying controls, I find them worse. I've always liked to fly on GTA SA, here It doesn't feel as good.
- Many vehicles don’t feel the same; they feel slower, weak. This might have been intentional.
- The final mission in the original game felt EPIC. However, in the remaster, the aiming is so accurate, and the enemy vehicles have such low health that it became boring. It was easy—too easy. Most of the final chase had empty streets because the enemies were quickly destroyed due to their low health.

I could go on, but these are the most relevant things I remember for now.

Do I recommend it?
If you find it at a good price, then yes. The first third of the game, I hated it. But after a while, I genuinely enjoyed parts of it. San Fierro, Las Venturas, and the second act of Los Santos were enjoyable. However, the 100% content didn’t feel as great as in the original.

[h1]Release state chat[/h1]
Now I cannot speak for the state of this game at release. Safe to say considering the reviews and the fact that it was pulled by Steam would suggest it was in a terrible state.

Luckily for me (In a weird way) I have been stung enough by hype trains and early access games that I basically NEVER buy games on release any more due to the shambles that the game industry is now.

So with 99% of new releases even ones I'm stoked for I sit back and watch to see how things pan out. This went down the drain big style which was sad I was looking forward to completing the trilogy for the third time as a “Definitive” version with achievements.

I waited for a year and purchased on Steam sale December '23.

[h1]GTA SA Revisited[/h1]

I played the bulk of my GTASADE play through before the big patch of November '24 which brought classic lighting and a whole host of fixes.

I enjoyed my time with this game and it was a nice balance of nostalgia and quality of life improvements

Some of the lighting and reflection work is great. Reflections on glass is impressive

It bugs me a little that there are 35 steam achievements and 48 Rockstar social achievements. Why not just have the same amount??

This is kind of what I wanted a remaster rather than a remake so it still has that original charm and jankiness of the old game while being substantially more fun to play. Its like a Bethesda game the original bugs appear but its part of the charm.

The QOL improvements are just simple things like a weapon wheel, radio wheel, graphics and lighting update, the driveby system being changed.

I'm glad I waited this long before purchasing as it looks like its fine now. Well at least I enjoyed it.

I started my Grand Theft Auto Career in 1997 when I got in trouble with my parents for playing a game making international news for the wrong reasons and I have never stopped coming back to the series. I have played every main line GTA entry to date and am happy with this Definitive Edition of San Andreas.

I do wish they released it like this with a bit more care and love however, rather than jamming an unfinished game out the door.

Lets hope they bake VI a little longer

1547000,True,"I know in what state the Grand Theft Auto Definitive Edition games where at launch, not worth the $59.99 they charged for them. There where way too many things that where bad, many smaller glitches and errors and some larger ones like the rain and lightning.
It took a while, but Rockstar updated their Grand Theft Auto Definitive Edition games and I got them for $23.99... which is a good price for all three games in my opinion.

Granted the three games still have some issues but I want to remind people of a very important fact: [b]GTA 3 & GTA Vice City run at 30fps... and GTA San Andreas runs at 25fps.[/b]
All three games where Playstation 2 games and the PC version is just a port of that. Similar to ""Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition"" those games where never meant to run faster then the stated fps. If you run those without the Frame Limiter they will not behave correctly.

So you have the choice of playing the originals at 25/30 fps... or get the Definitive Edition that can be run at 4k 60fps with the option of an original control scheme or a modern GTA5 control scheme.

[b]I don't know, for me the original three games are allot more fun then GTA IV or GTA V.[/b] Mainly because In GTA IV the cars are really crappy to control and in GTA V every car drives so fast and has a real bad handling, making you struggle to get around turns. Not only that, but in GTA V for some reason it feels like when you push in the analogue stick some the cars don't turn enough to really have a fine enough control over them, and when you press the stick slightly more in the car already does a hard max turn.

1547000,True,"I won't really go into the game itself. It's been out 20 years and you either know what it's about or you can hit up one of the million or so reviews that have been written since the Bush years. As someone who grew up playing it in 2004, here are my takes specifically on this as a port:

1.) FINALLY a PC port that will work with controllers and doesn't crash every 5 minutes. I got my hopes up several years ago with the port that used to be on Steam and I think it was the only product I ever actually returned for being literally unplayable. This version undoes all of that and sets the world right. So there you have it. San Andreas on PC and it just WORKS. That's enough to buy this on its own right.

2.) Graphics - again, as someone coming from 20 years of nostalgia looking to scratch that San Andreas itch, I have mixed feelings. The graphical rework really doesn't look bad, but it is a bit jarring. It seems like modern HD textures painted over the original PS2 3D models. Windows have reflections, explosions light everything up in a brilliant flash. It's not bad. I do think if there was an option to play with vanilla PS2 graphics I would probably be doing that, at least for one playthrough. But the game is still there and the rework doesn't break the San Andreas immersion. It's actually kind of cool to see some stitching on the clothes or the details of CJ's skin (I was admiring how realistic his wenis looked in one cutscene). It is growing on me the more I play but again, an option to play as vanilla as possible would be a nice addition for those who are entering Los Santos on a nostalgia trip. You will still find that classic San An haze lighting up the sky though.

3.) Controls are a mixed bag. It feels like a hybrid between San Andreas and GTA V. Pepperidge farm remembers pressing the X button (or whatever equivalent on your gamepad) to drive and that's what I immediately tried to do, but it's the right shoulder trigger for throttle. Aiming feels way wonkier. Perhaps I need to play around with sensitivity a bit more to find a sweet spot, but manual aiming is not easy. It was clunky back in the day but I don't remember it being this bad. Aim assist is often more detrimental than helpful. I'll have 5 Ballas charging at me, I'll snap camera to put them in the center of the screen and CJ locks on to one of my own homies almost off screen. Maybe someone who this is a completely new game for would do better, but I feel like I am still trying to play it on the PS2 and these hybrid controls are throwing me off. I am getting more used to them 7 hours in though.

3b.) Related to the above, an ""auto climb"" option is on by default so that if you walk into a barrier you will automatically climb without hitting a button. Thankfully you can turn this off which I recommend you do ASAP or your CJ will be like mine and throw himself over an overpass in the middle of a territory battle.

4.) A small but somewhat immersion breaking detail for me: I fondly remember how exciting it was to see a neighborhood drug dealer because these guys are loaded with cash, usually 2-3k. I would stop in the middle of missions to cap them back in the day because seeing one was a big deal. They usually wear hoodies and stand with their hands crossed in front of their belt and once you know them they are pretty noticeable. HOWEVER in this port they are EVERYWHERE. Like literally on every corner. I will be driving down the street and see three of them on a single city block. I walked out of the Johnson house and there were two standing just in the Grove Street Cul-de-sac. Like I said, these used to be such a big deal when one would pop up because of all the money you can get from them, but having them everywhere is like an infinite money glitch. I mean, I guess I could ignore them but also that savage 8th grader in me that swore to get every last one of them won't let me. It feels almost like cheating to walk down one city block for for 45 seconds and come away with almost 10k. I wish their frequency would/could be turned down so that when one does pop up it's more exciting and meaningful. I would rather have the challenge of spotting them and it being a significant event when I do. Maybe weirdly specific to me but whatever.

All in all, I am so glad to be able to finally play again after all these years. Even though it's different, it's the same. I am still way in the beginning and have so many parts of the story to look forward to. I'll probably update once I finish a run through with any other important details. For now though, I wholeheartedly recommend for anyone, whether you are trying to bottle the good ol' days or if you are whippersnapper looking to play one of the most acclaimed and significant action adventure games to ever be released.

Edit: I began playing around with mapping controls and found there is actually a preset ""Classic"" option that mimics a PS2 controller even on my generic bluetooth controller. It feels pretty much just like playing back in the day. Loving it.

Edit 2: I finally got access to flying vehicles. There is near constant graphical shenanigans going on when flying involving black patches around where the environments stitch together. It definitely looks horrible. Pretty sure though that this is a result of my modern computer having orders of magnitude more draw distance (how far you can see) than the PS2 coupled with how much of the game world detail can load at a time -- this is just an issue that never appeared on the PS2 because it was hidden by the technological limitations of the time. With that in mind I can mostly ignore it without it breaking the game for me. I know a little about game design and coding and I don't believe there even is an effective way to fix it so I can't really count it as a strike. The improved draw distance is actually somewhat cool -- from the top of Mt.

These post-update reviews + current sale are what pushed me over the edge to pull the trigger. I'm glad I did.

You can dress up a turd to make it pretty, but at the end of the day it's still a turd. Sorry, not sorry. 

Anyway~

[b]THE GOOD[/b]
The return of the classic lighting is honestly so welcoming, and seeing the Unreal's lighting in the streetlights turning on under the bask of the orange sunset is so gorgeous. The screen space reflections on cars really tops the atmosphere complete with a pretty bow to tie it all together. The baked in lighting? Really good, actually! Especially on the updated main character models which actually look surprisingly decent now.

[b]THE BAD AND THE FUNNY[/b]
That doesn't apply to the minor NPC, though! That Ticket Agent in the beginning? Holy yikers what a horrendous model! There's honestly just a lot of uglification everywhere, and some of it isn't even Grove Street Game's fault. This is just the result of blowing up a game meant to play at 480i (not p) on HD displays. Even with the touch ups made to the visuals, there is just sharp angles that stick out like a sore thumb due to the low polycount. I couldn't stop staring at the blurred, stretched and sharp lines at the police car door in the intro scene with Tenpenny. Speaking of, I don't know what the f*ck but their police car's rims dude??? The rims on the wheels was so pronounced and was about as thick as the tire itself. It looked like a cop themed lowrider, all that was missing was the white wall tire line. I was seriously beginning to think I was gas-lighting myself until I checked old PS2 footage and, no, the tires are fine there and just how I remembered them. So like... huh??

When I got on the BMX, I was displeased to find that pressing and holding W made you automatically go into full on pedaling. So I tried checking if there was an option to turn it off and there doesn't seem to be, but I did find an option for ""Modern Drivebys."" I do not know what this does. In fact, it wasn't even the first option that made no sense. When I first was setting up my game I saw an option in Audio that simply read, ""Autotune,"" and it was an on/off switch. It was also on by default. Like?

When I got out of the settings, I proceeded to do circles in front of CJ's house only to randomly fall off my bike, go up in the air, and gently come back on the objective marker. Just, lol.

Remember when I complimented the lighting earlier? Yeah, well, I don't know if it's like this anywhere else but inside CJ's house is full bright with ZERO baked in lighting. The characters have no shadow, not even SSAO shadows on their bodies. This makes the iconic intro scene that spawned meme completely uuuuuuuuugly.

During the BMX chase I noticed the higher quality bike model really likes to partially clip into the ground a lot. 

After that mission I went exploring for a gun to test out the ""Modern Drivebys"" setting (Spoiler Alert: I never ended up doing that) and I crashed into a pole, which CJ proceeded to go into the fall animation, to immediately frame skipping to him standing, just for him to do the fall animation again and then stand up normally. Again, lol.

[b]THE UGLY[/b]
The camera on cars, specifically on mouse, is a joke and you Rockstar needs to fix this. Maybe I'm a little weird, and I probably am, but I really got used to the 100% free cam in GTA IV. I practically drive manually aiming my camera during turns in any GTA style action game. In this game however? I'm about to date myself, but does anyone remember consolitis?  This game has consolitis and mobilitis. You cannot free camera while driving. If the mouse stops receiving input for 1.5 seconds the camera immediately tries to reset behind the car again. So, at least for me, I'm either playing tug of war with the camera or I have to wiggle the mouse around during turns to keep the camera were I'm looking at. And the even grosser part? The sensitivities between horizontal look and vertical look are different. And I don't mean ones slightly slower than the other. The horizontal camera is quick and snappy, but the vertical aim is needlessly really slow and heavy, like Sisyphus rolling the rock up a hill. And I play games at a crazy high DPI. Its much better on a controller, it was like that in the original too, but on controller I guess it kinda made sense? On mouse, hell no. And, if I'm honest, I don't think this was on the original PC version. The foundation of the Definitive Edition is the mobile versions of the games, after all.

I ended my little trial of the game before moving onto RDR1 by accidentally getting a 2-star wanted level. I drove my stolen car into CJ's garage, and bolted out of there only to see an old friend. CJ was able to basically shove a car like it was nothing just by running into it. I saved my game and went back outside to see if I could replicate it on Big Smoke's car and oh boy did I ever. This is 20 year old bad code still present in a definitive edition that has been out for 3 years. That is embarrassing. For those unfamiliar - in the original PC version release if you run the game at anything higher than 60 FPS some of the physics do not play nicely with that. For example, they let you push cars around like they're toys with just your body and make bike collisions very wonky, which is when I realized why I had those two weird bike incidents earlier.  Of course, capping the game to 60 fixed it. Why bother even including higher frame rate options and uncapped as an option if you're not even gonna bother fixing the physics, Rockstar? Get it together.

EDIT: Forgot this bit, but the weight lifting minigame is based the mobile version.

[b]NITPICKS I CAN'T EXACTLY CONFIRM ATM NOR DO I CARE TO[/b]
I don't know if it's just me, but Carl seems to have way too much energy and goes way too fast on the BMX. Maybe it's tied to the high frame rate issue, I dunno. It just didn't feel right. 

I also feel like blood pools take longer to form than they did in the original when I was running over pedestrians? 

Lastly, maybe it's just me having this on a 1440P monitor, but the pop-in is super noticeable even with the ground haze. I'm doubtful because I played the launch version of this PoS on a 1080P monitor and didn't notice.

[b]OVERALL[/b]
Listen, there's a lot of good fixes from what I've seen, especially for the other games, but I'm not going to pat Rockstar on the ass for animation fixes and pretty lighting. I'm not really a negative person when it comes to games. I'm not going to overreact at stupid stuff and deem the game unplayable trash or anything, and I will 100% commend them for continuing to work on the game. I hope there are more updates to come. However, there is something that REALLY bothers me about this product. This game was first sold to PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo customers worldwide first 3 years ago. This big patch a lot of people have been waiting for, for some reason, gets released on the 2023 Mobile port... which, if I'm remembering correctly, came exclusively to the NETFLIX VERSION OF THE MOBILE VERSION FIRST IN MARCH 2024? I find the fact customers who bought your product 3 years ago had to wait an additional 8 months for this update f**king ridiculous if I'm honest with y'all. I really hope Rockstar/T2 doesn't do something like that again because locking updates, especially to your BROKEN GAME, exclusively through limited collabs or partnerships for a game streaming service truly is one of the scummiest things I think I've ever seen a game publisher do.",1732772118,208.0,True,False,False,68,9,0.7048527598381042

No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog

Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night
Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, messed around and got a triple-double
Freakin' brothers every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a brother's direction as I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em

I picked up the cash flow

Left my homie's house paid (word)
Picked up a girl been tryna dig since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for the murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp""
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up

1547000,True,"[h1] THE DEFINITIVE WAY TO PLAY GTA SA IF YOU DON'T WANT THE HASSLE OF MODDING THE OG GAME [/h1]

Now I agree, I was among the critics of this game and the state they launched it in. Took them 3 years to fix this mess but here we are and the way it is right now, I can recommend it. I'll break it down why:

[h2] WHAT'S GOOD: [/h2]

- The original game albeit has better ""nostalgic feels"" but it could be somewhat of a minor inconvenience modding it to look to modern standard. If you're someone like me who doesn't like the hassle, I can say after the latest update, this game is almost there.

- Most of the animations are fixed now, the classic lighting option brought back the OG games feels and I'm all for it.

- The performance is also good enough after a minor fix (mentioned at the last) and almost 0 crashes.

[h3] MINOR NITPICKS: [/h3]

- Most character models are fine but some of them look absolutely cursed (for example: the fat ballas gang member, denise, some NPCs, etc.). I don't think rockstar is gonna fix it at this point but it does look ugly at times.

- The latest update fixed many broken animations (CJ crouching, swimming, etc.) but some weird animations still exist.

[b] VERDICT: [/b]

This game (the entire trilogy) is a recommend from me on a sale as I feel it is now at a point where you can just install it and play it (with the classic lighting option enabled) and it feels like the right mix of modern and OG game feels. Rating - 8/10.

Here's my suggested settings to get the best experience;
- use the command ""-dx12"" (without the quotes) in steam's additional command space
- run the game on high preset but turn off DLSS and turn down any sorta reflections to medium (ignore this if you have a beefy system)
- by default, the game sets the contrast at 50%. turn it down to 30%. it fixes the dark character models appearing too dark.",1732302153,3545.0,True,False,False,21,1,0.7467756867408752

3 and VC Definitive Edition are flawed. They have numerous problems in their design that are super questionable that will probably never be fixed, as well as a handful of extra bugs and downgrades. However, they are still pretty much representative of the game to the point where casual players aren't likely to notice. They have their problems and I still wouldn't recommend anyone play them if they have another option, but they are still very playable versions.

San Andreas Definitive Edition, however, is mush worse than flawed. It's an awful version. Bad controls (wtf is up with the flight controls on keyboard? Why is the mouse camera super slow on only the Y-axis? Why can't I super sprint? Why is auto climb on by default???), bad or missing audio (minigun sound is super off, police dispatch is missing the ""suspect last seen"" lines, radio EQ option is gone entirely making the bass boost option in cars useless, some sounds in general seem much more crushed than the original version), badly ported map (there are holes in the ground and collision issues EVERYWHERE, especially in Las Venturas and the countryside to the point where it's impossible to ignore), bad textures, bad models, bad, bad, bad. They even went as far as to bring mobile handicaps, like the simplified gym and dancing minigames over to every other platform with no option to turn it off! Now instead of button mashing to lift a weight, it's a super simple quick time event that you can do with any weight size regardless of muscle. They also needlessly changed mission scripts for no reason which added even more bugs, such as the seemingly intentional change to let CJ off of the jetpack during Black Project which can softlock the mission since the jetpack can despawn if you're not on it!

During my playthrough a patch dropped out of nowhere. While a welcome surprise, it didn't really do much. They added a classic lighting option that looks way better, almost exactly like the PS2 graphics (in most areas, they overcorrected in places and now SF is now way TOO blue...), and fixed some of the bigger bugs (no more 100% AI accuracy thank God), but it's gonna take a lot more than one patch to fix these games. It was a good first step, but I'm not confident enough in their ability to continue to patch the game seeing how long it took for that one to come out (over 2 years!).

Avoid at all costs. If you are on PC, you have no excuse to not play the originals. This version does not represent San Andreas and would be better experienced with one of the original releases. Somehow it isn't the worst version of the game (that award goes to the 360 and PS3 ports of the mobile version), but it's still not something I'd want to see someone else endure or even worse, think is normal! Do not trust people that say that they ""fixed"" DE or similar statements. It has a long way to go, and it's not getting there any time soon.

However, After waiting for just over a year, Rockstar decided to replace the old dev team that made the game and now it looks like it's on the right track, I can't wait to see further updates to improve these games as they deserve more love and care + I hope Rockstar Games decides to Do a remaster of some of there older games too for new gen PC's and consoles as I first started with GTA Vice City Stories and would love to see a remaster for that or even a new Midnight Club.",1731527497,196.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5161290764808654

As regards the [i]Definitive Edition[/i], I thought the more modern graphics were nice, and I had no problem playing the game on my PC. There were some bugs, but nothing too major, except for a specific mission in a park in Los Santos that felt impossible to beat because the enemies were shooting non-stop from afar just after CJ spawns from a cutscene. Those shots were enough to kill me in a couple of seconds and I struggled to beat the mission because of this. I don’t remember having any problem with that mission in the original [i]San Andreas[/i]. Other than that, the atmosphere is not so good in this edition, because the lighting is different, and some weather elements like clouds and fog no longer exist.

As for the game, when compared with [i]GTA3[/i], and [i]Vice City[/i], it has too much filler content. It does do a few things better, though: it has better shooting mechanics, allows you to fly lots of planes (including a fighter jet), the main character can now swim, and the map is huge in comparison to the previous titles. These things, however, are not enough to make this a better game. Both [i]GTA3[/i] and [i]Vice City[/i] feel much more compact and go straight to the point. One thing I disliked about [i]San Andreas[/i] was the gang wars. They felt like a poorly designed gimmick, implemented just to fill the game with more content. The action was always the same: equip the M4 and shoot from a distance the hordes of gangsters coming at you from afar. The story of the game is uninteresting, with missions that feel like side quests most of the time. Moreover, CJ lacks the charisma of the previous main characters (even compared to Claude, who without muttering a single word, still had a badass aura).",1731430918,2117.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4761904776096343

1547000,True,"Okay, I'm not sure who's gonna read this... But here's my take. I originally bought the Definitive Edition on day one. However, due to some kind of licensing problem with the music (at least I think it was the music), I was locked out of being able to play for at least 48 hours or more (if I recall the hours until they fixed it correctly). ON DAY ONE!!! After watching all the negative videos about glitches, poor performance, and a ton of poor reviews, I realized purchasing this was a mistake and I got a full refund. However, somehow I recently came across The Definitive Edition on Steam again and saw it hugely discounted so I thought, well why not. Maybe I can mod it to bring it up to standard.

So, for some history...I've been playing GTA since the first one came out (yes I'm old). I have played GTA1, GTA2, GTA London, GTA 3, VC (and VC stories on PSP), GTA SA (on Xbox and PS2), GTA 4 on Xbox 360, and GTA 5 on PC to give some context. Therefore, I can easily say that The definitive edition is honestly a pile of ****. There are no debates if you've played them in the past on previous consoles. I'd be hard pressed to find someone who says otherwise. The textures look plastic, the lighting is off (too dark in some areas, and overall bad), etc. The gameplay is also off by some measure but I can't quite put my finger on it. However, the DE does have some stuff in it's favor. It has GPS system which helps in SA (not so much in the other games because the maps were simple to learn), certain lighting effects like shadows against walls are a nice upgrade, it has updated controls, Steam achievements, etc... Overall though, THIS IS NOT A FULL PRICE GAME SERIES (+60.00 USD). WAIT FOR A DISCOUNT!!!!

So what now?...Honestly, with a handful of mods (suggestions from youTube) I added a few things to make it playable to my tastes such as giving Ryder a non-glossy windbreaker, to a full on Denise re-skin. However, the biggest change I made was using a program called reshade to make it look like I was playing on an old CRT. It made it feel a little more like a re-release and not a *definitive edition by adding scan lines and a little blurriness. This is because if you were kinda poor like me in the early 2000's you had a s*** tv (compared to the 4k visuals we have today). It added just enough punch for me to get into them again.

If you are playing them for the first time, I'm sorry. If you're just looking to rekindle the love you had for these when they released use reshade and some mods to suit your tastes. Otherwise, these releases are just super F***in' meh, and poorly done. At this point I'm not even expecting any further patches from R*. I REPEAT!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE AT FULL PRICE!!!

This is only getting a ""Positive"" thumbs up because at the core of it all, it's still GTA. I don't blame Grove Street Games for this mess up given that RockStar did not give them enough time, or proper assets to work with, nor did they do it on a game engine that could emulate the feel of the originals (I could go on and on, and others have). 

So after all that is said and done I'll finish with this... although these games are severely sub-standard I love the stories, the memories, and playing through them again if nothing more than for the nostalgia.

Thanks for reading!

1547000,True,"This review is intended for people who are wondering if this version of San Andreas is at all playable. I've previously played this game on Playstation 2 and Xbox, and I also own the original Steam version, so a few weeks ago I was also wondering whether to even bother with this.

Just to get it out of the way, the Definitive Edition is not a good example of how to do a remaster. Many of the original bugs remain in the game, some of the songs are missing due to expired copyrights, and I've even encountered some new issues during my playthrough in the form of glitches that could've been gamebreaking, but were easy to resolve. 

The graphics of this version are hit/miss. Truth be told, the original San Andreas looked bad even at the time of release; the 3D universe of GTA games were really more about the gameplay and extracting as much performance from the PS2 console as possible through all sorts of dark coding rituals. The result was nothing short of a technological marvel at the time, but not one that was always easy on the eyes. Still, the hazy, orange aesthetic of Los Santos in particular gave the game a nostalgic, early '90s vibe that went really well with the game's story and setting.

The Definitive Edition doesn't always succeed in preserving that particular aesthetic, so if you are looking for a full-on nostalgia trip, then this is perhaps not the best way to experience it. On the other hand, this version does look better in places. Not GTA V level good by any stretch of the imagination, but sharper than the original. There are some issues, however, with rendering distant objects, which may appear as undefined blobs until you get closer. Also, being able to see Mount Chiliad and the skyline of San Fierro from across the map sort of ruins the illusion of the map size, but it is what it is.

As said, I own the original Steam version as well, but what made me end up choosing the Definitive Edition for a new playthrough was the convenience of it. Full controller support and being able to seamlessly switch between that and kb/m was a definite blessing, since in the Steam version I had to go into the task manager and disable a bunch of things to even get the kb/m to work somewhat properly (and repeat this step every time I started up the game), and the less said about the controller support the better.

The Definitive Edition also has a few quality-of-life changes, such as a weapon wheel, as well as a checkpoint system that makes it a bit easier to work your way through the missions. They also made the Supply Lines mission easier by giving the RC plane a lot more fuel and armor. My 100% playthrough of the original is too long ago for me to notice any other concrete differences, but I did feel like I had an easier time getting to 100% this time around.

In the end, the Definitive Edition of this game is kinda half-assed and does as many things wrong as it does right, but truth be told, it was mostly fine to relive San Andreas in a hassle-free manner. You might be able to curate a better experience by modding the original, but if you're like me and you just want to (re)play this game without jumping through hoops, the Definitive Edition allows you to do that without too many issues. On the other hand, if you're looking for an experience that is true to the original, then just find a copy of said original on your (retro) platform of choice.",1730597209,3942.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.5454545617103576

In my youth, I played the original PC version of GTA: San Andreas endlessly—completing the story over fifteen times and achieving 100% completion on multiple occasions. This game holds a special place in my heart, meaning far more to me than just another nostalgic title.

As we approach the end of 2024, a recent patch has addressed a number of bugs, including some visual issues. However, for a devoted fan like me, it still doesn’t feel as polished as it did back in 2005.

On a [i]PC setup[/i], the mouse and camera controls feel clunky, making it nauseatingly uncomfortable to play—especially on a large monitor where low-resolution textures and model pop-ins are painfully obvious. In that environment, the overall quality drops significantly to [b]1 out of 5[/b].

On the [i]Steam Deck[/i], however, these issues are noticeably less pronounced. The controls are more manageable, and the graphical shortcomings aren’t as jarring on the smaller screen. Under those conditions, the experience improves drastically to a respectable [b]4 out of 5[/b].

1547000,False,"After playing this thing for a second time in a year—once in the original and then here—I can say that I'd rather play the original 2,000 times over this. However, this game feels pretty mid in everything it does or tries to improve over the original, feels half-assed and like no one that played the original on PC was supervising or testing the project once it was done.

In order for the newer graphics and engine to achieve the thing the devs wanted to do or tried to do with this game, you have to install roughly 20 to 30 mods (especially the one that implements volumetric fog and ReShade).

Pros:
-Cool graphics (with mods)
-GTA V weapon wheel (which I forgot existed until Las Venturas)
-The checkpoint system is actually helpful in SOME of the missions (ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN, CJ)

Cons:
-The character graphics and textures look taken out of Fortnite but compressed to 12 kilobytes (I can't stress enough how fucking ugly and simplistic most of the NPC faces look).
-The character skeletons look like a skinwalker just got inside all of them and is pretending to be them.
-They somehow fucked up lipsync in some cutscenes.
-The game without mods looks like Fortnite with a 30,000% scale down and compressed to PS2 graphics.
-The LOD is stupidly bothersome.
-The lampposts and traffic lights you crash against do not drop to the floor, they just clip through it for some reason.
-The map, especially on the west side surrounding Mount Chiliad, has a lot of unfinished connections with the textures, where you can see lines that stretch across the roads and train tracks where you can just see the skybox due to things not being properly connected. The same happens with some buildings or houses, like, for example, the one at the Quarry.
-The car planar reflection sometimes is too much of a contrast to some of the textures and characters (some cars too high, others too primitive).
-The controls of some vehicles make me wanna grab a rat, lick it, then take a cockroach, munch on it, swallow it, grab a chalk and do the funny loud noise while listening to goat screams in my right ear and an earrape recitation of the Bible in my left ear. RC planes, planes, jetpack, and helicopters felt like they ported the mobile controls to PC without even trying them out, instead of just using the original or GTA V's control scheme.
-A lot of the side missions that you need for the 100% completion, like the Trucker or the Quarry, have rage-inducing glitches, such as your load glitching out on surfaces with height differences, making your truck be pulled into it just like in GTA Online when a modder takes your car and makes it float away into the skies and then kills you. The Quarry's 7th mission has some issues with the things you place in the Dumper, where they would sometimes clip into the floor or fall off the vehicle even if you didn't press the lift bed button.
-And talking about the [R] button-tied actions, sometimes they auto-toggle, which means that things like the Hydra might get auto-toggled to send you forward straight to your death!
-Got some crashes as well, unknown as to how, when, or why, but I got a total of roughly 8 crashes, if not more.
Allied NPCs, especially during gang territory wars, will not attack and stay next to you regardless of which command you input, even if there are enemies shooting you or if you are shooting the enemy.
If you load a bus with your homies, you have a chance you will blow up to the high heavens for absolutely no reason.
-Cops can take you out of your helicopter even if you are above them.
-Some cars in the northeast of Los Santos are unable to use the bridge and will simply clip through it, get stuck, and explode.
-Something something radios with removed tracks...? I dunno, probably just mod it.
-The sound mixing is terrible. Earrape on one side and then you can't hear whatever dialogue the NPCs are saying for shit.
-Swimming is slow as fuck for some reason, and it feels tied to cycling? I can't prove this, it just felt better after a while, or maybe I just got used to it.

TL;DR...
The main story is ALRIGHT at best, but the side missions and the aerial vehicles are complete and utter garbage in terms of optimization, controls, glitches, etc. And so are the graphics... though out of the 3 games, I think this one is the one that feels slightly closer to the original in that regard.

Nostalgia Meets Modern Expectations

As someone who played *GTA: San Andreas* during childhood, my initial experience was very different from what I have now. Back then, I didn't fully explore the story and wasn’t deeply invested in the game's narrative. Like many others, I used cheats to have fun in the massive open world. I remember a particular mission that I found incredibly difficult at the time, but now, as a more experienced gamer, it’s become one of my favorite tasks—easy and enjoyable.

As a devoted fan of the series, I decided to purchase the **Definitive Edition** to see whether this game, which holds so many memories, still stands the test of time. Was it worth the time and effort? Here’s my journey through *San Andreas*, without cheats and with the goal of achieving 100% completion.

The Switch from Cheats to 100% Completion

When I first started playing the *Definitive Edition*, I, like many nostalgic players, resorted to cheats for old times' sake. However, I soon discovered that using cheats prevents you from unlocking achievements, which took away some of the excitement for me. I deleted my save file and decided to restart the game with a new challenge in mind—completing the game to 100% without cheats.

This turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made in gaming. For the first time, I played the game the way it was intended—without shortcuts, without skipping sections, and with full attention to the depth of the story and gameplay. Achieving 100% completion turned into one of the most fun and rewarding experiences I've had in gaming.

Story: A Tale of Loyalty and Betrayal (10/10)

The story of *San Andreas* is one of its strongest aspects. From CJ's return to Los Santos to the reuniting of the Grove Street Families gang, all the way to the collapse and ultimate rebuilding of CJ’s power, the narrative is compelling throughout. Characters that initially seem minor or even forgettable—like Emet or OG Loc—end up having surprising significance. One of the game’s strengths is how it weaves these characters into the larger story in unexpected ways.

The progression from street-level gang disputes to high-stakes political intrigue is handled excellently. Watching CJ evolve as a character and navigate both personal and criminal challenges is both engaging and immersive. It’s a classic rise-and-fall tale that continues to resonate, even years later.

Characters: Memorable but Occasionally Inconsistent (9/10)

The game is filled with memorable characters, each adding their own flair to the story. CJ is a fantastic protagonist—relatable, grounded, and motivated by loyalty to his family and friends. His dynamic with his brother, **Sweet**, is one of the strongest parts of the narrative. Their relationship feels authentic, driven by brotherly love and the shared goal of bringing Grove Street back to its former glory.

However, some characters left me confused. For instance, **Ryder**—initially portrayed as just another gang member who smokes a lot of weed—makes a sudden, unexplained shift in loyalty. His betrayal felt underdeveloped, as the game doesn’t offer enough insight into his motivations or reasoning. Similarly, **Big Smoke**'s arc, while iconic, could have used more depth to fully explain his turn against the gang.

Despite these minor issues, most of the main and supporting characters are well-developed and engaging. Characters like **Officer Tenpenny** are unforgettable, and CJ’s journey is filled with colorful personalities that add to the game’s charm.

Main Missions: Fun and Challenging (9/10)

The main missions in *San Andreas* are where the game truly shines. The variety is excellent, from gang warfare and car chases to casino heists and government conspiracies. The missions manage to balance both over-the-top action and grounded storytelling, making for an engaging experience from start to finish. 

Completing these missions without cheats made me appreciate their design even more. Some are challenging, but they never feel unfair. Every mission contributes something meaningful to the overarching story, making each step toward 100% completion feel rewarding.

Side Missions: Surprisingly Fun (9/10)

For the first time, I completed all of the side missions, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed them. In my previous experiences with *San Andreas*, I often ignored them, but this time around, they became one of the highlights of my playthrough. 

Whether it was firefighting, taxi driving, or paramedic missions, each side activity was surprisingly enjoyable. Some were difficult—especially those requiring precision, like the **Zero RC missions**—but overcoming these challenges added to the overall sense of accomplishment.

Graphics and Effects: A Mixed Bag (8/10)

The **Definitive Edition** brings with it a significant graphical overhaul. Compared to the original 2004 release, the visuals have improved drastically in some areas—lighting, reflections, and environmental textures look far more modern. Driving through the cities, watching sunsets, or simply wandering through the countryside feels more immersive than ever before.

However, there are still a few odd visual glitches that take away from the experience. For example, CJ riding a motorcycle sometimes results in awkward animations, making him appear hunched. While these minor issues don’t ruin the game, they can occasionally pull you out of the otherwise immersive world.

Final Thoughts:

Despite some minor flaws and dated mechanics, *GTA: San Andreas – Definitive Edition* still stands as one of the best open-world games ever made. The sheer amount of content, the deeply engaging story, and the freedom to play as you like make it a must-play for both new and returning players.

My journey to 100% completion was full of nostalgic moments, new discoveries, and challenges that tested my skills. If you're a fan of *GTA* games, or open-world games in general, this version of *San Andreas* is absolutely worth your time.

Overall Rating: 9/10

The launcher was really unnecessary and why do I need it? Can't you save games locally anymore? It's a shame that it's going in this direction. Apart from the graphics, I couldn't really find any differences to the original version, and there is also a bug that bothered me:

- The skill system, you hear that there's a change, but you don't see it. Sometimes it's displayed anyway, you get used to not knowing where you stand skill-wise.

The flight controls are also absolutely crap, I couldn't do the optional mission: ""Supply Lines..."" from Zero because the plane (or RC) just keeps wobbling around in the air, even with a controller there's no chance, I probably got 3 grey hairs more and unfortunately had to skip this mission. Maybe I'm too incompetent, but it was somehow easier in the original.

Is it worth the money?
Is it better than its predecessor?

The money for the game is 60EU and for me it is worth it spending 60EU for the 3 games (Grand theft Auto SA, VC, 3 DE) if you want a lower price i will recommend putting it on your wishlist and i think that evry month they  discount it 50%

I think that it is not better than its predecessor because the predecessor(SA) didnt as many glitches as TDE but i think the controls of TDE are better and it is worth just buying the TDE rather than installing 57 mods just for the original game

[b]San Andreas DE is by far the worst version[/b] from the 2 other games in the collection.

1547000,True,"[h1]GTA San Andreas: The Trilogy — Not Perfect, But Still Fun[/h1]
San Andreas in the Trilogy version actually gave me a pretty good time. Sure, it's not flawless and there are things that could’ve been done way better, but it still brought back that old-school GTA vibe — and that’s what matters most for me.

The gameplay is still solid. The map is huge, full of life, and just fun to explore. Customizing CJ, upgrading his stats, doing side missions, or just messing around in the world — it all works and still feels great. The remastered graphics aren’t perfect, but they do have their moments. The lighting looks nice, the world feels sharper, and the overall look is fresher, even if some parts are a bit weird.

[h2]I played it before the big patches — still had fun[/h2]
I want to point out that I played San Andreas before Rockstar started patching it and fixing bugs after all the complaints. Yeah, it was buggy. Some character faces looked strange, shadows acted up, and I had a few random crashes. But honestly? I still had a great time.

The game was totally playable, even in that messy launch state. None of the bugs ruined the experience for me. Maybe it’s nostalgia talking — I played the original a lot back in the day — but even the jankiness kind of added to the charm. The story pulled me in again, the world felt alive, and I just had fun being back in Los Santos.

So if you're worried that the game was “broken” at launch — yeah, it had problems, but it wasn’t unplayable. It still delivered a good experience, even before the patches.

[h2]The price is the real problem[/h2]
The biggest downside? The price. You have to buy all three games — GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas — as one bundle. There’s no option to get them separately. And let’s be honest, most people just want San Andreas. It’s the fan favorite, it’s the biggest, and it holds up the best.

Selling the whole bundle for full price feels like a cash grab, especially when the remasters aren’t fully polished. If they sold the games separately, a lot more people would jump in. Right now, it feels like you're paying extra for stuff you might not even touch.

[h2]Final thoughts[/h2]
San Andreas still holds up, even in this updated (and slightly broken) version. If you loved it back in the day, chances are you’ll enjoy it again — bugs and all. Sure, there are flaws, and yeah, it could’ve been handled better. But if you can look past the rough edges, it’s still a great ride.",1726483593,2241.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5454545617103576

With over 17.5 million copies sold, San Andreas is PlayStation 2's best selling game of all time. You might remember it from the old days when you'd sit in front of your CRT and spend your afternoons, or from the countless of memes you see online today. Either way, this is a classic and for many the best entry in the franchise. San Andreas, alongside Vice City, arrived together for GTA 3's 20th anniversary in the DEFINITIVE package. Definitive money making package at least...

[h2]Technical Aspect[/h2]

[h3]Another disgusting mobile port[/h3]

Much like all 3 definitive versions, this one is also based on the mobile port from 10 years ago. San Andreas was notoriously the worst mobile port of the original trilogy and is absolutely the worst definitive edition as well. Countless of bugs, physics issues, missing textures and so much more. Pair that with lighting that is completely screwed in some places and controls that will make you want to question your sanity. The technical aspect of SA is mostly the same as GTA 3 with a few exceptions, which are mostly negative.

[h3]Mouse movement is messed up[/h3]

This is something that is puzzling me. San Andreas had vehicle camera movement ever since its original release and somehow out of all 3 definitive editions the mouse movement in this one is the worst. Vertical camera movement is basically non-existent and the camera constantly fights with you to snap in place when you try to move it. In GTA 3 it also tried to snap in place but for some reason everything feels worse in San Andreas.

[h3]Draw distance and fog[/h3]

""Hardworking professionals"" decided to max out the draw distance because, you know, new hardware and whatnot. In the original game a sort of fog effect was used to hide the low draw distance present in the PS2 version. In the definitive edition you can see all parts of the the map from anywhere. I don't know about you, but seeing Mount Chilliad from Grove Street just doesn't feel right. This is another one of those changes that was never really tested properly. After some backlash on social media they added a ""Ground Haze"" effect to try and fix this, once again it was made very lazily and only renders at very high altitude.

[h2]Bugs and changes (Honorable mentions only, it will take ages to list all)[/h2]

[h3]AI accuracy bug[/h3]

Notorious bug that has plagued San Andreas since day one of its release. In short, after getting into a car the AI in the game becomes more accurate to accomodate for the large object you are driving. All fine and dandy as when you get out of the car the accuracy would reset... right? It does not and people in the mid 2000s were constantly complaining about this on various forum threads. It was quickly understood that taking a car to a shooting mission will almost certainly cause death. Later it was found that taking a bike instead will help lower the accuracy. Well in the definitive edition, instead of trying to fix this bug, they decided it would be a great idea to make the AI just have 100% accuracy all the time. No need to bother looking for a bike now, chump!

[h3]60 FPS physics all the time[/h3]

SA is THE GTA when it comes to physics issues related to FPS (at least from the 3D era). Playing on more than 30 will break animations, swimming, some cutscenes, ammo depletion and much, much more. Unlike 3 and VC, here you pretty much can't play with anything other than 30. Well the ""hardworking professionals"" decided that variable physics were not needed anymore and just decided to lock them to their 60 FPS behavior. Yep, I was sure that they would never fix physics for these definitive edtions but hoped that they would at least lock them at 30. Because of their laziness we are now stuck with this mess and while there is a Frame limiter in-game it won't do anything to help with the problem.

[h3]Controls make no sense[/h3]

Major changes were made to the control scheme of San Andreas when it was released on mobile phones. These changes were mostly ok for a touch screen device but questionable for a big console and PC release. Most gym minigames are a cake walk now with these changes and menus in stores are also very odd (shoutout to the ""T"" on your keyboard). The biggest problem are helicopters, they fly with the mouse now and it's really unintuitive and annoying to use them. Most people just plug in a controller for this part but that's not something you should have to do when playing on PC.

[h2]Art direction[/h2]

Like in all 3 games, the atmosphere and feel of the original version is completely gone. San Andreas had 16 different weather types on PS2. Definitive Edition has about 6 and they are almost all identical with only minor changes. It really is a shame as these effects looked great in-game. There's no need to mention the goofy character models and AI upscaled textures, most of them look cheap and worse than many fan made projects.

[h2]OG is the way to go[/h2]

Another absolute classic butchered by Rockstar and Take-Two's corporate greed. A shameless slap in the face to the millions of fans who've grown to love these games over the years. While 3 and VC may be barely salvageable if you look past their many issues, San Andreas Definitive is not. Not for a dollar and certainly not for $60. The best thing you can do is get the original version on PC and mod it. If you have a PlayStation 2 lying around, you can also get it there for the REAL definitive experience.

While this is definitely the biggest update released for DE so far, I still stand by most things I wrote in this review.

[h3]What I didn't like:[/h3]

[list]
[*][b]Police cars driving themselves:[/b] It did happen more then once in my 87 hours of playtime to see a police car driving with no one inside.

[*][b]Performance issues:[/b] The game has significant performance issues, ranging from frame rate drops to general sluggishness. That happens despite the fact that I am running the game on a pretty decent PC.

[*][b]Texture and rendering bugs:[/b] There are moments when textures don’t load correctly, and the rendering is a complete mess.

[*][b]Game lock-up during a cutscene:[/b] At one point, the game locked itself during a cutscene, forcing a restart.

[*][b]Pedestrian cops throwing themselves in front of your car:[/b] Getting a wanted level because cops are suicidal is beyond frustrating.

[h3]What I did like:[/h3]

Despite all these issues, there are some positives. If you can overlook the terrible optimization and performance issues, the game does have its moments of beauty. The graphics, particularly the lighting and reflection effects, can be genuinely good looking.

[h3]Final Thoughts:[/h3]

Despite all the negatives, I still found myself loving the casino and gambling aspects of the game.",1724873543,5238.0,True,False,False,8,1,0.5979260206222534
1547000,False,"Like with the other two: overall the games are great of course, true classics, but, alas, there are some terrible things marring the experience. In this one it's the Assassin achievement with the horribly implemented stealth kill mechanic that doesn't work two out of three times. Of the 10 times I stealth killed the second guard by now the animation worked correctly A SINGLE TIME – leaving me without a clue whether the animation spazzing out still COUNTS as a stealth kill, of course! Then afterwards the bartender sometimes spots you, sometimes you can get past. Finally, adding insult to injury, you have to let the guards slowly shoot you to death to reset the mission (at least there is a checkpoint system in this one mercifully).Truly this is the most horrible experience I had in any of the 3s games, beating even flying a plane with the mouse in Vice City (until I found out there ARE keys for it too, at the very last moment...). Sure, after some 50 attempts and like 90 minutes of frustration I got through now, but how? By following an exact path of positioning and actions, and that is as far removed from a sandbox game as I can possibly imagine. (Side note: of course we all know that every other mission in the fifth game is like that... which is why I never even finished that turd).

I had to cheese the Burglar shit too by just robbing two things from a house and entering a different one to respawn those two things and repeat because the way you are actually supposed to do it is cumbersome beyond belief (grabbing things only works when it wants to work...) and basically not worth anyone's time. Or what about the treadmill... I get on, then I fall off. The game doesn't even tell me (after the first time) what key I have to press in order to run! There were little bars in the original explaining these minigames which they TOOK OUT! Stamina sure seems to take a lot of time to go up, when at the same time you can go halfway to the muscle maximum in three or four training sessions. The vehicle schools are a crapshoot, where sometimes you have to turn the frame limiter, or turn it off, so that you can eventually get that one lucky try. There should never have been a 100% requirement for Gold, 90% would have been just right! Even so, the rewards are mostly useless... vehicle spawns in ONE location. Do you know how big the fucking game map is?!? Only the Hunter is a good reward cause it makes Vigilante POSSIBLE (next to impossible without it, just like it was in the other games). Oh and gang warfare was a joke in the original, but here you are WIPED OUT in phase 3 in less than 2 seconds with health and shield both at 150!!! I was supposed to be able this to raise my weapon skills, but that simply is no longer possible here! Fucking garbage!

Things like these show that testing clearly was not done before releasing these remasters, tons of bugs were added while no grievances were lessened or removed, and that's completely unacceptable, after all there was no reason to re-release these games with just some improved graphical effects to begin with – there's TONS of console-only spinoff games a PC player can't even play to this day, they should have ported those instead!

PS: oh and the sheer idiocy of replacing 10 rewards for 10 hidden packets each with one shitty reward (GTA 3 was the only one who got it right, giving you the weapon spawns in EVERY hideout, not just in ONE) for spraying 100 (!) tags has to be mentioned here! As is the fact they still don't give you the thing you need the most... armour. And neither do the other collectibles. Major downer there. And I can't even imagine getting them all without a guide... makes you wonder what they were thinking, if at all... the snapshots are literally INVISIBLE, LOLOL

PPS: With Rockstar's unacceptable anti-mod attitude nobody should buy their games at all, obviously. I for one will not re-buy 4 and 5 on Steam (it helps that they both sucked, of course).",1724867749,3026.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.4827586412429809

1547000,False,"The original game from 2004: 10/10. One of the greatest video games of all time.

As of the recent update, Rockstar has taken it into their own hands to fix this game. In this new update, my game is crashing frequently, which never happened when I played the game before this big patch.

This version of the game is STILL an overall downgrade from the original release.

The Pros:
-Supports refresh rates beyond 60hz
-SOME parts of the graphics overhaul look great
-Plays well on Steam Deck
-Checkpoint system during missions (the only reason I personally play this over the original release)
-Better pedestrian variety
-Controls a lot better than the original release
-New lighting fixes and original skies - drastic improvement!

The Cons:
-Lots of bugs and issues that weren’t present in the original version (still present after the recent patch)
-Cut/downgraded mechanics and visuals
-*Dealing with Rockstar Games’ AWFUL LAUNCHER*
-Frequent cloud save issues and conflicts when switching between PC and Steam Deck
-Countless cut songs on the radio
-No custom tracks
-Lots of remastered models look awful 
-Runs poorly at times for no apparent reason on high-end hardware

This re-release of the game is still a shame. The modding community continues to release graphics/gameplay mods that trump  this release of the game. Rockstar’s inability to release a good version of their games on the PC is frustrating. And no, ""fixing"" it three years after launch shouldn't give them a pass.
