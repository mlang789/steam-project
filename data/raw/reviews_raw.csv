570,english,True,"I've been playing Dota 2 for 12 years now, off and on throughout my life it is one of the few constants. In high school, my friends and I spent many nights playing when there was only one courier. In college I played once or twice a year on my rented laptop from school. During the pandemic It was a way for my brothers and I to connect when we couldn't actually visit each other. It holds a great place in my life.

[h3]The Good[/h3]
- Gameplay is dynamic, engaging and rewarding once you get the hang of it. There are so many moving parts that when you make your first big play, there is very little that can match the feeling of satisfaction when played just right. 
- Flourishing Pro Scene: If you want to get better there are countless new and old pro players that stream or release content on Youtube to help you improve, and often times Discord chats to find players to play with.
- Semi Consistent Updates: They just released one of the biggest updates the game has seen since Talents were released in 2016, or neutral items were released in 2019, or when they DOUBLED the size of the map in 2022. Valve isn't afraid to experiment with this game, and while you can get stuck on a single patch for a long time, you can always know that Valve Devs are working on something truly different to add.

[h3]Negatives[/h3]
- Mental Health: This is a team game. I love it for that, but playing with others can be frustrating and demoralizing. You can also find yourself ""chain queuing"" which after multiple losses can really effect your mood outside the game. My girlfriend and I have a rule that I cant start a game after 10pm because if i lose badly sometimes I will be too angry to fall asleep or talk before bed. You have to find these ways to look inward yourself, and without barriers it can really negatively impact you.
- The Community: I said it a bit above, but if you're new to online games there is so much racism, sexism, anger etc. I've met really great people playing dota, but the brain tends to remember the bad eggs. Remember there is a mute button.
- Communication from Valve: There can be crickets from valve sometimes. They ARE working on stuff, but if you read reddit to much you can get a bit riled for no reason.

Overall, best game I've ever played by a long margin.",1716594963,195605.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

Let's start with the community, shall we? A lovely bunch, really, if your idea of lovely involves getting flamed for daring to pick a hero someone else wanted. And don't even get me started on the joy of encountering smurfs who stomp around like they own the place, leaving a trail of shattered dreams in their wake.

But wait, there's more! Ever wanted to experience the thrill of spending an hour in a match, only to have your hopes dashed by a single misstep? Congratulations, Dota 2 has got you covered. And let's not forget the joy of watching your teammates rage quit faster than you can say ""GG.""

And don't even think about trying to improve. Sure, you could watch tutorials, read guides, and practice till your fingers bleed, but why bother when you can just blame your losses on everyone else? It's the Dota 2 way!

But overall, despite the salt mines and the occasional dumpster fire of a match, I would still recommend this game. Because beneath all the toxicity lies a surprisingly addictive experience that somehow keeps you coming back for more punishment. So, if you're ready to dive headfirst into a cesspool of salt, frustration, and occasional glimpses of actual gameplay, welcome to Dota 2.

The extreme level of different abilities and vast power-spikes can turn a fun and engaging early game experience into a god awful immune to literally everything Slark one-shotting your entire team EVEN if they're fed.

DOTA just simply does not hold up with the level of competitive integrity that other similar titles offer. The overpowered, overloaded, over-the-top skills quickly get old as you're constantly left scratching your head after the 5th team of people that all speak different languages after waiting 40 minutes to finally get a good match where someone doesn't abandon and waste all your time.

The game is not salvageable it will die. Inevitably. In the very least at least some small places in the world will keep the player count around 200k~ for a while, though once all the old folks get tired of it.. That's it.

570,english,True,"Left LoL after finding this game around 1 year into playing league with friends in highschool(about 2014). I loved Dota right off the bat, the first thing that stuck out to me was that nothing except cosmetics can be bought or unlocked.

My League friends unfortunately never got it. I had to keep playing League with them, they refused to give the game more than a few hours each. Crushed me, still bitter about that to this day.

My love for Dota turned into a total obsession. I learned as much as I could, and played whenever I had the time. I was so inspired by Fear and Dendi's stories in Free to Play, I wanted to go the distance myself. I saw Dota as the one path for me to turn my boundless enthusiasm for strategy games into freedom from jobs I didn't love and a place I didn't want to live. The one rope I could use to pull upward into the future I wanted for myself. Of course, I decided to become a professional Dota player. 

This wasn't meant to be.

I was working as a busboy at the time and would work my shift and come home at night and play, then work again without any significant breaks. I would go 24-48hrs without sleep regularly to play as much Dota as I could without missing any work. Went to 1 LAN and placed 2nd, that was one of my favorite experiences in my life. Also met people from all over the world and learned words(mostly curses heh) from languages I would have otherwise never encountered, got to practice my Spanish a bit too. I grew so much as a person from the interactions I had in Dota. It shaped me.

Despite my extreme(and overzealous and counterproductive in retrospect) dedication I never got above 3.6k MMR. What happened instead was that I ended up in the mental hospital from playing between 5 and 22 ranked matches a day and not sleeping on top of working my full time job bussing tables(which I worked as hard as I could at as well). When I got to the hospital I was 135lbs(I am 5'11"") and hadn't eaten or slept for 6 days, and was in full blown manic psychosis. Maybe if I had been provided for and fully supported during this time(and born without bipolar disorder) by my parents, I could have done it. We'll never know, but that's what happened. What I did was the epitome of the adage: ""burning the candle from both ends"". I flew too close to the sun and crashed and burned in the flames of psychosis and malnutrition. 

It's been almost 6 years since that episode of mania. Don't worry guys, I'm fine now, I sleep and eat every single day and have never had a recurrence of mania. I use medication to stabilize my mood whenever that pattern fails. Although I still enjoy the game a lot, I really only play turbo on and off since that's what I have time for. Gone are the dreams.

I know I spent a lot of time on this game, and I will regret somewhat my failure to become pro for the rest of my life. At one point it was everything to me. I lived, breathed, and dreamed it. That said, I look back on all that time with nostalgia and fondness. This is a game that will one way or another leave an impression on the rest of your life. You will either give up at less than 50 hours, or you will never forget it. 

How can I not recommend that?
It's a masterpiece.

570,english,False,"Dota 2. From Warcraft 3 Custom Map to here. I love Strategy game. For me, this game is the best MOBA. yeah Really,The gameplay,just awesome. bunch of heroes there,use items for powerup, u need use ur brain play this game,especially the items. the heroes have their own Abilities, and The graphics are good!. u need teamwork to win this game..............

Wait...

i just said teamwork?

No f ng way, This game have terrible Community,toxic Community,its just bad,really bad, more than horse dog or bull Sh*t, I Play in SEA Server. it just the the worst server, its like Place of Cr4p. The people dont have attitude,Blame Support,Blame Carry,Blame Everyone. Missused Report System, never give a chance for newbie. Feeding to enemy, Ruins ur Friend Gameplay. Chat full of Sh*t. just What the f? 

i said Missused Report, For Example, I have experience when playing this game, Select the hero. the game start, Waiting for other people loading or join the session. someone just take long time for loading, and then the people says ""report Report that nub loading,report"" WHAT THE??? U REPORTED someone cuz he/she have long loading at Start of the game?.  U ALD REPORT PEOPLE CUZ LOADING??? R U F KIDDING ME? THAT LOADING IS HIS/HER FAULT??? PURPOSE OF REPORT SYSTEM IF UR TEAMATES ARE TOXIC! FOR EXAMPLE: Feeding to enemy, use bad words much. and maybe you need tolerance to people who  cant play the hero propely. Teach him/her, RESPECT! dont blame,or report or other bullsh*t. ALL U NEED IS RESPECT! RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE!

U cant avoid Bullying here,The community just cancer,cant Cure. If u Strong enough,u can play this game,be a good people,dont be toxic. I never recommend this game cuz its community, I know there's good poeple there,if u LUCKY!. I prefer play with bots even the bots are stupid. or play with ur friend,dont ever try Public.

570,english,False,"Dear DOTA devs. Do you ever play YOUR OWN game? I guess not. Please tell me this:
How is it FAIR that you play a match, you get teamed with some idiots, and they can just report you for whatever reason like example ""You don't speak russian"". They are 3-4 friends and they decide to report you because they don't like you for not being russian. You reach a certain amount of reports against you and you are banned from all type of gameplay except Single Draw or whatever it's called. You can't even do some of the tutorial matches! So basically If i was to get together with 3 of my friends and just keep reporting everyone we play with we can just fuck them all over for laughs. How is this fair? I think you should work on your reporting system. 

Another point:
As a new player, 34 hours of gaming clocked by steam and 10+ hours of that was waiting for a match, like last night i waited 4 hours+ because i'm being put into low priority single draw matches for some asshats reporting me for not speaking russian. So as a new player WHY am i put against players with 1900 and 2400 hours+? How am i suppose to fight against them? You people REALLY need to get your head screwed on right.

Eventually my son asked to play a game that sounded to me like DOTA.  I been addicted ever since, and he's been playing since he was 6 years old.  The new patch I thought is a great way to freshen the game.  I hope they do radical changes like this every year to keep people into the game.   I see quite a few negative reviews.  Anyone who wants no change but is willing to play for 30 years can go back and play the WC3 with the mod, that thing is frozen in time forever.

I have to admit the game is starting to wane with me too, but thats not because of the changes.  Its hard to keep up with the game trends to remain relevant in playing.

The reporting system also feels very frustrating. It seems that players can report you simply because they don’t like you or because you didn’t play the way they wanted. There doesn’t seem to be much review or fairness in how those reports are handled.

Matchmaking is another issue. It allows brand-new accounts, even ones using cheats, to be quickly matched with high-level players. That’s not only unfair but also ruins the balance. For example, I recently had 5 losses and only 2 wins in matches that felt extremely one-sided.

Right now, the game feels like it’s balanced somewhere between “complete chaos” and “genuine fun.” I really hope these issues are taken seriously and improved over time, because the core gameplay has potential.

570,english,True,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy the Formuoli",1487995332,420.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

570,english,True,"Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.

If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.

Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.

Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.

The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.

At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.

There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.

Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.

As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.

Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.

It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway ""secret"" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.

While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.

The original Dota was an unexpectedly powerful blend of clashing genres and disparate elements that ended up taking over the world, and Valve's successor retains the original rules and characters while adding in a cheery free-to-play model and slick production values. The experience of playing Dota changes day by day--some evenings will be exhilarating, while others will kick your morale to the curb--but there are few games as worthy of your time investment as this. Those who choose to commit to Dota 2 will find many happy hours within this immaculate update.

""Ты не сможешь уснуть пока не будешь уверен, что твоя мама в надежных руках.""
Это все что нужно знать об этой игре, сама она супер, но ужасное комьюнити ставит на всем крест, людей токсичнее, чем тут надо еще найти, худо-бедно слегка ситуацию исправляют рейтинговые матчи, а так место игры на свалке, как и тех кто туда заходит периодически. 
Окончательно сломали систему подбора игроков, напротяжении 10 игр в подборку закидывало отборных овощей, с учетом моей высокой порядочности, игроки принципиально сливают игры. Выбираю быть натуралом и активно ухожу в Форзу, что и Вам советую, раки в чане спокойно сварятся и без Вас.

Se eu recomendo? Sim, caso você feche uma pt com 5 amigos e joguem numa boa, do contrário é só estress esse jogo, comunidade tóxica, lixo, não presta, faz você literalmente sentar na frente do pc e querer desinstalar o jogo, pois deixa de ser algo divertido, um passa tempo, algo prazeroso, pra ser algo extremamente estressante, o que infelizmente, a Valve, não faz nada pra resolver...

570,english,True,"Dota 2 is probably the best online game I've ever played. I've been playing Dota 1, both online and offline, and it took some time before I tried Dota 2. But when I tried Dota 2, I immediately decided to stick with the game.

For Dota 1 players, you will find transitioning from Dota 1 to Dota 2 quite easy since Dota 2 is very much like Dota 1 although significantly improved. The game is as exciting as Dota 1 since players will have to use their wits and skills to beat their opponents in battle. 

This game will test not only your hand and eye coordination but also your ability to make quick decisions and good strategies. And because you will have to work with different players in your team with varying personalities, you will ultimately learn or acquire valuable traits like patience, leadership and the quality of being a teamplayer.

Therefore, for me, this game deserves 5 stars!",1487857458,182930.0,True,True,False,0,0,0.5

Cons: pretty much need a team to get anywhere if you are focused on raiting or overall longevity of the game.

570,english,False,"This is review for 2020 from perspective of pos 4 player that playes with team members only so this review is more about the competetive side of dota then your casual ranking.

Pros:

-much faster gameplay then it used to be

-with full squad Its still as fun as it used to be

-being one trick pony pays off more

Cons:

-Solo players and team players are 2 different species. If we play in a squad of 4, the random guy most of the time has no idea what is team play.

-Meta play got worse. What I mean by that is, that if you dont play meta heores, you will f*cking lose no matter how good of a player you are. In team vs team games Its all about game strategy, not individual skill and there is not much space for creativity because the op heroes are really op and average heroes are just not good enough.

-Jungle drops after 40 mins are unbalanced, some are really trash in every situation compared to others.

-most meta heroes are not fun to play all the time. Like who the f*ck enjoys playing Viper every game?

-Repetetive gameplay due to the need to pick the same 15 heroes all the time if you want to win.

-RNG, but I mean, that was there since the beginning but its getting progressively worse. Yea, Iam looking at you Ogre.

Conclusion :

I havent played solo in a few years but when it comes to full squad 5 on 5, It got more boring because at higher levels, you have to pick the same shit all the time, which is not fun, or you will lose, which is also not fun.

Fun if you play like 4 games per week, play more and Its boring.",1487586206,127832.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

570,english,False,"What once was an awesome game, many of the great underused heroes have been neutralized to the point where playing them is no longer an option.  You can't play a support without the other four on your team cursing at you in a language you don't know while they feed ( due to a poor decision of how to que players ).  Many of the great heroes are classed as supports when they are better as nukers.  Zeus stopped being support the same time as Sven, Pugna and Necrophos, because none of them use support abilities to begin with.

Personally Pugna is my favorite hero, but everytime I play him mid, by minute ten the safelane's tier two tower is already at half health.  If I play him offlane, the mid player yells at the team for not ganking to mid as they lose their tower at six minutes.  Safelane is impossible because someone picked last second Phantom Assassin or Sniper and assume you are support them.  At twenty minutes you can kill any hero in three seconds with the right item and skill builds, but that rarely comes as your carries fed all that time.

Players during the weekends tend to be the teenagers home from school but think cursing out everyone makes them ""the man"".  The report system is flawed to that with the influx of bad players ( racist messages, intential feeding when you don't let them get last hits ), prevents the system from being correctly used as you are limited to one or two reports a week.  Many abuse the system such as if they are in a party on your team and you are the sole person not in their group, if you lose the game, it is your fault that you are 20 and 2, while it is the reverse for the rest of your team as you kept the game going longer in correcting their mistakes as long as you could.  There is no punishment for false reporting yet.

At this point I just play Techies, who as of the 7.00 patch, was made a laning nuking hero rather than a roaming wanderer with no direction.  I hate playing the game other than wanting explosions, pulling off high kill numbers and half the time we might win.  I recently played a game last night before I uninstalled for twelve hours to install other games for the time.  An Axe who thought he'd lane with me said to report me, when he tower dived under aggro from the tower, and I was no where near the fight to begin with.  Once again an idiot says to report another just because they thought they were ""the man.""

The game itself is great, the players are horrible people however, only thinking of themselves as the sole carry of the game, as they go on to not get a single kill for 30 minutes and being muted by the whole team far before hand for the racist rants that will never get reported because you spent your allotted one Report on someone the night before.  It would be great if the flaws were fixed with reporting players, then perhaps the game would be more likely to be played more often.",1487561855,279983.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.496957391500473022

The tower aggro seems to have no rhyme or reason, and when you start taking tower damage, the tower seems to gain infinite range, champions who are melee seem to have ranged attacks, the graphics are poor and the game is just bland.

570,english,False,"If you want a game that freely promotes abuse, racism, narccessim, idiotism, name calling, masochism and believes that the only game that exists that is of any value to play is DotA... then you got it.

Avoid it like the plague. Due to an extreme fanatic behaviour, this game will steal your money since you don't worry too much about spending a few items on cosmetics here and there. I have wasted over 250€ on this 'free' game. I have also played it for over 2500 hours.

But here's the two reasons why I am stopping and why I will plead to anyone to stay away from this shite game:
1. The fanatic behaviour I spoke of before? It comes from a deep hatred of other games. Its direct competition is League of Legends and the reason why anyone who's played DotA for a long time is due to one of the founders of League had a website.
This website was the most used forums by DotA players and he cancelled it. He said it himself it was due to conflicting interests and it makes a lot of sense. But due to this the already extreme narcessists playing DotA became even more extreme. It is not uncommon or even considered unreasonable to insult people on EXTREME levels of death threats, ethics, ethnicity and skin colour because they aren't as good as someone who's put 2000+ hours into the game.

This is the first reason why I will plead to anyone to avoid this game, don't support its gambling and addictive nature and just stay away from it.

2. I realized a few months back which is when I kinda stopped playing. It is first now that I will genuinely sell my entire inventory and make sure to get rid of EVERYTHING to make it darn clear I don't want to come back.

A game of DotA is usually not too bad. However, when compared to other games an average game still makes you perhaps not smile or chuckle but it doesn't piss you off to just the nature of 'eh, this game was okey'. In DotA; those are the games that the most rare things to find.
The low points of most games gets you annoyed and you stop playing it. DotA digs you so deep into a hole that you keep playing and keep making it miserable for other people playing with you in the following games... even tho' they weren't even in the initial game that got you on this downward spiral.

The only thing that keeps folks coming back is those amazing games! However... they only feel so amazing due to how crappy every other match makes you feel like. The low points are insanely deep and the high points are just shallow victories. Not close matches that you had to fight for and had to use every arsenal you got. If you do that then you will have folks adding you on Steam and telling to kill yourself because you were split pushing and taking down their base as they just charge around on the map as an example.

Avoid the game. It is NOT a game to be played! It is one to avoid at ANY cost!",1487513241,153793.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.404287904500961304

570,english,True,"If you came here looking for a review, you came to the wrong place. If you came here looking for a delicous pie recipe you came to the right place.
1. Apple Pie 

3 pounds mixed apples (such as Granny Smith, Gala and McIntosh)
2/3 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 disks dough for Basic Crust 
1 large egg, beaten
Coarse sugar, for sprinkling

Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick. Toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the flour, cinnamon and salt; cook until thickened, 1 more minute. Let cool.

Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface; ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the apples, mounding them slightly in the center, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay it over the filling; press the edges of the crusts together, then fold the overhang under itself and crimp to seal. Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust. Chill 1 hour.

Place a baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet; lower the temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Cool on a rack.",1487473395,127671.0,True,False,False,1,2,0.523809552192687988

Pros:
1. tons of community made skins
2. easy to find a match because of how popular the game is
Cons:
1. The easiest heros are the hardest to kill and the hardest heros are the easiest to kill.
2. THE COMMUNITY IS PROBABLY THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY YOU WILL EVER FACE (Biggest Con)
3. Way to easy to be sent to the low priority punishment pool.

570,english,True,"Love the game, but I'm not too crazy about the ppl. 1- Too much complaining about others all the time, ""my team sucks, you are bad, noob, etc etc"", if your are so good then win the game, even with a noobie team; it IS possible. I'm learning, I'm low level (I don't play ranked) so I don't need the review of someone that believes he is DotA God or something. It's a childish attitude, it's like you have the need to point it out ""it's not me; it's you"" (sometimes is the one who complains that is so selfish and not able to play as a team, but is the first on complaining and picking on someone else, a lot of times they are not even THAT good). Being ""bad"" at low lvl while one tries to improve is not a crime, and we have the right to play, as anyone else; 2- Too much complaining about ""unfair low prio"", by posting threads insulting everyone. If you know ""abusive behavior"" can make you have a report, why are you so surprised when it happens? Is not about being good or winning the game, is about the conduct, but it seems no one wants to take resposability for their own actions. 
3- TOO MUCH insults, for everything. It's really rare to pass by one game without being insulted or seeing how the others insults each other.
In any case, I still think this is one of the best games I ever played, and I will keep playing.

The tutorial is impossible. If you can't find someone to teach you, you aren't going to learn. It is that hard. The other problem is the community. I love them, but I have heard them doing some awful things. So if you are going into the game cold, do three things.
-Demo Heros before you play
      This game is hard enough, but some heroes are near impossible to start on. I reccomend heroes with simple spells and straightforward passives. Pick faceless void or sniper. Both very easy...
-Practice with bots
    Practice or the community will hate you, also... expiriment. There are many secrets hidden in the settings you can try.
-Report players who are abusive in language or tell you to quit or uninstall. They probably feed as much as you do.

730,english,False,"CS2 has one of the worst anti-cheat systems I’ve ever seen in a competitive game. It honestly feels like the devs launched the game, switched off the lights, and went home. Every single day you run into players who are blatantly cheating — not subtle, not questionable — blatantly. Spinbots, wallhacks, perfect aimbots locking onto heads through smoke… you name it, CS2 is serving it.

And the anti-cheat? It’s basically decoration. It just sits there doing absolutely nothing while cheaters run around ruining match after match. You can report the same guy 5 times in a row and the system still throws him into your next game like it’s a feature. Trust Factor is a joke — legit players get punished, but cheaters skate through untouched.

Competitive? Completely unplayable.
Premier? A circus.
Casual? Filled with people testing their “private” cheats like it’s a practice range.

What makes it worse is the silence. No communication, no transparency, no visible improvement. It’s like we’re all screaming into a void while the anti-cheat casually sleeps at the wheel.

CS2 could be an amazing game, but right now it’s basically a cheater simulator with fancy graphics. Until Valve wakes up and builds a real anti-cheat — not this broken, useless system — I can’t recommend this game to anyone who actually wants fair matches or competitive integrity

730,english,True,"Counter-Strike 2 feels like a fresh but familiar evolution of the classic CS experience. The new Source 2 engine brings noticeable improvements in lighting, smoke physics, and overall visuals, making the game feel more alive without losing its competitive identity.

Gunplay is still satisfying and skill-based, which longtime players will appreciate, while the updated maps and mechanics add just enough change to keep things interesting. The new smoke system is one of the best additions, adding more depth and strategy to every round.

That said, CS2 still has some issues to work on, such as optimization, bugs, and missing features compared to CS:GO. However, the core gameplay is strong, and with future updates, the game has a lot of potential.

Overall, CS2 is a solid step forward for the franchise and a promising foundation for the future of competitive FPS games.",1766534965,7989.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988

Every round hinges on teamwork, map knowledge, and precise weapon control—no flashy abilities, just raw skill. The satisfying crack of an AK-47, the heart-pounding rush of a 1v3 clutch, and the thrill of ranking up keep players hooked for hundreds of hours. Sure, occasional cheaters and a salty community pop up, but Prime matchmaking and a loyal fanbase smooth those edges out.

730,english,True,"TL;DR: most non competitive modes are not fun an comp has a high skill floor just to participate but mechanics are sound and shooting is fun

CS 2 is a well made shooter with great and simple mechanics on the surface but a hellscape in competitive if you don’t go full in. In my 800 hours in this game I’ve tried climbing the competitive ladder a few times and honestly I’ve only been in gold like 3 times pretty much 80% of my playtime is in silver 1 or 2 (please don’t laugh). I’m not saying I deserve to be higher because I know I’m pretty bad at FPSs, but the part that bothers me is the times I actually was ranking up was when I watched hours of smoke lineups and angles and strategies for certain maps, which I agree at high or even medium level play makes sense but I’m at the bottom of the barrel here getting hit with instant smoke lineups and pop flashes as well as some movement tech. I honestly don’t have much of a problem with competitive being what it is if there was a non competitive mode that didn’t feel like it was so much lesser than. It would’ve great to have the exact same competitive mode without ranks but it doesn’t exist. Not having a better standard mode means going to competitive to feel like your getting the best gaming experience but even if you don’t mind losing it kinda ruins the game for people who are trying to win when someone like me who can’t aim and doesn’t know all the map tech shows up and plays like garbage. 

All in all it’s still a good game. It’s mechanically sound and can be fun it just gets bogged down by having bad non competitive options.",1766498984,47745.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Counter‑Strike 2 is CS’s sequel — classic 5v5 bomb mode, tactical depth, and flawless headshots (sometimes) — now rebuilt on the Source 2 engine with dynamic smoke, updated visuals, and global leaderboards. ()

It’s free to play and still one of the most played shooters on Steam, with massive competitive appeal and huge e‑sports momentum. The rounds are crisp, tense, and rewarding when you outsmart your opponent — but be ready for learning‑curve sweat and some internet chaos. 

Pros:

Tactical, rewarding gunplay that veterans live for 🎯 

Updated engine, graphics, and smoke mechanics 🔥 

Free‑to‑play with global leaderboards 📊 

Cons:

Cheaters and toxic lobbies still a thing 😅 

Some players report hit registration or performance frustrations ⚠️ 

Market/skin economy drama and skin‑price rollercoasters 💸 

Verdict:
The classic CS thrill evolved — still tense, still tactical, still free… but be ready for salt, sweat, and the occasional hacker.
Recommended (if you like competitive shooters).",1766484444,46573.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

730,english,False,"I’m genuinely surprised that a free-to-play competitive shooter can have such poor performance.

For context: I’m playing on a 4K monitor with a budget GPU (Intel Arc B580). Even so, getting unstable ~60 FPS on the lowest settings, with FSR enabled in Performance mode (50% scaling, effectively rendering at 1080p), is very disappointing. This happens in both DX11 and Vulkan modes.

Unfortunately, this has been one of the most unpleasant gaming experiences I’ve had in a long time.

For comparison, Valorant runs flawlessly on the same system: I can easily achieve 250+ FPS at max settings without any upscaling, and I genuinely enjoy playing it.

It’s a real shame. I don’t need cutting-edge visuals or complex technical features—I just want a smooth, playable experience to enjoy the game with friends from time to time. Sadly, that feels unnecessarily difficult right now.",1766359995,24397.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

730,english,True,"Alright, I'm a new player to CS. Picked up Global Offensive in 2015 - 2016 which was the first time i'd touch any CS game. And then the current 700+ hours followed so I'll share my two cents:

CS2 is basically Global Offensive but modernized. Gameplay feels familiar enough, core mechanics are unchanged (except for the trade ups ofcourse but...yikes) and overall it's just a new way to keep our beloved GO spirit alive.

That being said, after ten years they still haven't fixed the cheater problem. At all. That is one of the few nitpicks I have against this game. Other than that, sure I'd say go ahead and play it for a few hours & see if you like it. Prime status helps with getting less cheaters but to be honest, roughly 60% of the playerbase is cheating anyways which just straight up sucks.

TL;DR CS:GO went super saiyan 2 but still has a cheater problem. Game good, Anticheat horrible. 7/10",1766332474,44052.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

730,english,True,"I’ve been playing Counter-Strike since forever, and I can honestly say that Counter-Strike 2 takes the series to a whole new level. If you’re a fan of tactical shooters, you NEED to play this.

Let’s talk about gameplay: It’s everything you love about CS, but smoother, faster, and more intense. The new Source 2 engine makes everything look amazing — the maps have way more life, the lighting is beautiful, and gunfights feel even more satisfying. Honestly, I found myself admiring the environment in between rounds... and I’m not usually the type to stop and smell the virtual roses.

The matchmaking system has also been massively improved. No more getting matched with people who are either way better or way worse than you (we’ve all been there). The new rank system is a nice touch, and the games feel much more balanced now. It’s easier to jump in and have fun, whether you’re playing casually or trying to climb the competitive ladder.

Now, the gunplay. If you’ve played CS before, you know that’s the heart of the game. It still feels as precise and rewarding as ever. Headshots? You’ll feel it. Recoil control? Still tough, still awesome when you get it right. Every shot counts, and that’s what makes this game so intense. Every round feels like an epic battle.

And let’s not forget the community. With better modding tools, custom servers, and more support for community-made content, CS2 feels like a living, breathing game that evolves every day.

In short: If you loved the old CS games, you’re going to LOVE CS2. If you’re new to the franchise, prepare for a wild ride. It’s the perfect blend of strategy, teamwork, and sheer adrenaline. Don’t miss out on the game of the year.",1766316304,26442.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.491803258657455444

730,english,True,"Getting back into Counter Strike with CS2 and I've gotta say, I am having a good time, despite all of its flaws.

Yeah, if you use the same PC you got fine fps on CSGO then CS2 will not feel good at all. You need a VERY good framerate for this game and sprays feel much better, I'm serious. I'm talking like 300-400 FPS average MINIMUM and 200fps+ 1% lows to really feel good. When I got a 7800x3D I liked this game much more.

The changes to smokes were awesome. It has seriously changed so much about map control. May be controversial, but I am honestly a fan of getting rid of jumpthrow binds. 

There are still plenty of times where you peek, go behind cover, then get awped when you weren't visible... just subtick stuff. You were visible on their screen and on the server, but whatever, it sucks. You can do that to them too...

MR12 still leaves me a bit confused about the economy sometimes, but I do like the length of games now. Sometimes on MR15 there were points where I was like ""is this game over yet??"". The economy seems much more important to pay attention to in MR12. Getting reset can much more easily lose you a game, and resetting an enemy can win you the game. 

I do miss KZ mod though... not GOKZ, but the better one. I played that one years ago and it felt incredible. With forced subtick in this game, it just isn't feasible anymore. I easily put 100s of hours into that mode and had a great time. I still feel the improvement to my movement to this day, but it was honestly fun more than anything.

If i didn't pay for this shit as much as i did i wouldn't have played it more than 30 hours it sucks on so many levels but mainly the game mechanics feel annoying and just amplify miniscule difference skill to absurd levels which makes the game absolutely unplayable if u r playing with randoms. (may be this is different on higher level but i guess ill never know).
cant wrap my head around why >1 million ppl are playing ts right now many of whom waste thousands of hours on it
the gameplay feels so repetitive for me i think addition of a bunch of maps possibly with frequent rotation could solve that but this does not really align with competitive philosophy of the game and core audiences autistic obsession with that whole cybersport shtick",1766248240,7371.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I'm not asking for you to make the game fun and be funny on coms or anything, just don't be a douche over text and voice. Some people can't seem to help that though, so only about 1/3 - 1/2 (maybe) of my games are fun. Not to even mention the racists, and the hackers.

730,english,True,"Valve has blessed us once again—not with Half-Life 3, don’t be ridiculous—but with Counter-Strike 2, a game that proves you can, in fact, make the same experience shinier and still have everyone scream in delight (and agony).

First off, it looks gorgeous. The reflections are so realistic that I spent two minutes admiring water puddles on Mirage before getting one-tapped by someone with 300 hours in aim maps. The smoke grenades? Now volumetric, baby. They react to bullets and grenades, which means instead of providing cover, they now beautifully showcase how terrible my spray control is.

Performance-wise, the tick rate upgrade feels good—until your 17-year-old teammate starts yelling “PEEK HIM!” while your 200ms reaction time proves you are, in fact, too old for this. CS2 runs smoother, but your rank? Still the same. Valve made sure of that for emotional continuity.

The new UI looks sleek, the gun models gleam like freshly waxed sports cars, and the matchmaking queue still perfectly matches you with teammates who bought AWP and died without using it. It’s good to know some traditions are sacred.

730,english,True,"My Love for Counter-Strike 2

Counter-Strike 2 is more than just a game to me; it is an experience that shaped how I think, focus, and spend my time. From the first match I played, I was drawn into its intense competitive world, where every second matters and every decision can change the outcome. CS2 demands precision, teamwork, and mental strength, and that challenge is exactly why I fell in love with it.

The game pushed me into a lifestyle that many would call “no-life,” but to me it was passion. I spent countless hours learning recoil patterns, studying maps, improving my aim, and understanding strategies. Each loss motivated me to get better, and each win felt earned. CS2 taught me patience, discipline, and how small improvements every day can lead to real progress over time.

As someone on the autism spectrum, Counter-Strike 2 gave me something powerful: structure and focus. The clear rules, predictable mechanics, and skill-based system made the game deeply engaging. It allowed me to hyper-focus, block out distractions, and express myself through gameplay rather than words. In many ways, CS2 felt like a space where my strengths mattered and where dedication was rewarded.

Beyond gameplay, CS2 also connected me to people around the world. Whether through teammates, rivals, or friends I made along the way, the game created a shared language of callouts, strategies, and moments of clutch plays. Even without speaking much, I felt understood through actions in the game.

In the end, Counter-Strike 2 is not just a shooter I played for fun—it is a game that challenged me, shaped my routine, and gave me a sense of purpose. It demanded my time, my focus, and my effort, and in return, it gave me growth, memories, and a place where I truly belonged.",1766189640,33204.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

730,english,True,Played Cs back in GO but not much. Cs2 is fun especially with friends and tbh single queue is rough a lot of times. the skins are cool though and you also get to rank up and collect badges. The aim is tricky and learning all the callouts for each of the maps can take a while but once done it makes the game so much more fun and I enjoy it. There is a lot of comms that are needed within the game and also a lot of cheaters cause Valve jus don't care imo.

We’ve been playing this game for years. Years. Through patches, updates, metas, and whatever phase the devs are currently experimenting with. Loyalty has never been the issue.

The cheating system, however, very much has.

It would be fantastic — truly revolutionary — if at some point during this long, shared history, the developers decided to fix it. Not reinvent it. Not “improve detection over time.” Just… fix it. Cheaters remain a regular feature, and reporting often feels more ceremonial than effective.

The game itself is still fun, otherwise we wouldn’t still be here. But nothing kills enthusiasm faster than realizing skill, time, and effort are optional when someone else is running third-party software with zero consequences.

We’ll probably keep playing. We always do.

It would just be nice if fair play eventually joined us.

730,english,True,"Considering that the game is very popular and interesting. Of course, it also has its flaws. There are a lot of toxic people, people who play 24 hours a day, and now a lot of bots. The game is fun, but because of these shortcomings, it loses its charm. If you are not a fan of toxic people and you want to play for yourself, it is recommended that mute everyone in the game. Even the only good thing about this game that takes it to a higher level is selling the boxes that you get every week. I don't understand the point of expensive skins. All in all, if you want to play the game, I highly recommend it, but be prepared for all these things, because they can easily ruin your experience in the game, and that very easily. If you want to enjoy this game, you have to be really good, so yes.

And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of them crooks:
Rooking their guests and cooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve them of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
Never was a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges
Plus, some little extras on the side!
(Oh Santa!)

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice (Hand it over!)
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks I knows
How it all increases, all those bits and pieces
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

Master of the house? Isn't worth my spit!
Comforter, philosopher and lifelong shit!
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!

Master of the house!
Master and a half!
Comforter, philosopher
Don't make me laugh!
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Hypocrite and toady and inebriate!

Everybody bless the landlord!
Everybody bless his spouse!

Everybody raise a glass
Raise it up the master's arse
Everybody raise a glass to the Master of the House!

- Game doesnt recieve updates
- It used to be ""pay to recieve the most basic things that every game allowed it to you for free""
- Servers filled with cheaters, bots, etc.
- Toxic ""friendlies"" (they could fucking doxx you if they would want to)
- Pedos, preds and much more
- Community as a whole hates you if you DARE to say anything bad aboud valve or TF2 (pretty much same as friendlies)
- CS2 exist, why play this when theres a better shooter game
- Game is dying, which means dead servers
- With each ""holiday sized update"" game is broken for weeks until valve decides to fix it
- Sprays and objectors are mostly used just to portray sexual themes (met once a guy who made R34 art of hatsune miku, which she is 16 btw and was proudly showing it to whole server)
- Racists, sexists, homophobs, xenophobs etc. 
- Game overall is actually not that fun

Anyways thats pretty much everything that i could think of, if youre gonna type hating comments it just proves that TF2 community is literally everything that i just pointed out.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

2. There isn't too much weapon variety-you basically get a couple of things to choose from and some are clearly better than others.

440,english,True,"You can play this game without paying a single dime, it costs absolutely nothing to download and play normally without voice chat, text chat, anything like that. All you have to do is buy any one item in TF2, some costing as little as a dollar, and you'll gain access to voice chat and be able to communicate with other players. I'd encourage any players who want to get good at the game to either buy some weapons they want to try out or grind the achievements and unlock a few weapons that way. The main thing about TF2 is that there are multiple ways you can play. What I mean is that there are 9 characters, or ""classes"" you can play as. I recommend trying them all out and seeing which ones you like playing the best. Me personally, I think that the Engineer, Spy, and Soldier are my three favorite classes to play. However, other players might like to play other classes like Scout, Demoman, Medic, or Heavy. It all really depends on YOUR playstyle what classes suit you best, So here's what I recommend to people just looking at this game and reading the reviews before downloading: Spend some time (preferably equal amounts) on each class and find out what playstyle you like best. There are stock weapons for each class, but I'd recommend trying out some weapons in the shop (There's a free trial option for those who aren't sure about a weapon they want to try that gives a 25% discount on them during the trial that you can do once a week) to try to optimize your playstyle. My default spy loadout, for example, has the ""Deadringer"" watch, the ""Your Eternal Reward"" knife, and the ""L'etranger"" pistol because they work so well together when going behind enemy lines and killing off the enemy team wile staying hidden.

TLDR: Try everything. Throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. Learn your playstyle. Once you do what you love, you'll love what you do. That's what makes TF2 so fun in the end.",1764658722,5110.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Soldier: I got it. 1, 1, 1, ummm, 1.

Scout: Go, go.

Heavy: INCOMING!

Scout: AAA-hey, it's still here!

Spy: Ahem. Gentlemen.

[Meet the spy intro plays.]

Spy: I see the briefcase is safe. Tell me, did you happen to kill a red spy on the way here? No? Then we still have a problem.

Soldier: And a knife.
Scout: Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of spies, they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you! Ow. No offense.

Spy: If you managed to kill them I assure you they were not like me. And nothing, nothing like the man loose inside this building.

Scout: What are you, president of his fan club?

Spy: No, that would be your mother!

Scout: [Stammers]

Spy: Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.

Soldier: Oh!

Scout: Gimmie that!

Spy: The spy has already breached our defenses.

Engineer: Sentry down!

Spy: We've seen what he's done to our colleagues!

Sniper: [Gets backstabbed] Ahhhh!

Spy: And worst of all, he could be any one of us!
Medic: Raus, raus!

Red Spy: [Turns into Medic]

Medic: Nein...

Spy: He could be you, he could be me, he could even be-

Scout: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Soldier: What? It was obvious! He's the red spy! Watch, he should be turning red any second now......any second. See, red! Oh, wait that's blood.

Heavy: So, we still have problem.

Soldier: Big problem. All right, who's ready to go find this Spy?

[Scout sneaks up behind Soldier and Heavy, readying his balisong. He reveals himself to be the Red Spy all along.]

Red Spy: Right behind you.

[Team Fortress 2 theme plays as Soldier and Heavy get backstabbed to the beat of the theme. Then cut to Spy sifting through the pornographic Polaroids of him and Scout's mother until he picks up one where they're holding hands.

440,english,True,"I've been playing multiplayer FPS games since the end of the 90s and I have to say that this one is at the top of my list. Now i really love this game so this review is by definition very subjective. 

Here are my reasons : 
 
Positives : 
- The artwork, graphics, lore and general atmosphere are just fantastic
- The characters are hilarious and unique in their own steriotypical way 
- The gameplay is solid and teamwork is crucial - a solid team which knows how to work together will almost always win over individual skill
- The overall balance is relatively good given the amount of builds and weapons available today (which will always be a cause of balancing issues). 
- Communication is needed but no mic is essential thanks to a good number of voice commands
- A good variety of maps and different game mods
- Quality updates throughout the years (while the game is still supported properly)
- Music, voice acting and sound effects are quality ! 

Negatives (most have to do with the current situation) : 
- No more updates
- Perhaps too many weapons and items which are borderline useless with most older or vanilla builds still being the most effective ones (just my opinion) 
- Bots being present on multiple servers (a long lasting issue, not sure how much of it was fixed though)
- Not many servers rolling old time popular maps (GoldRush, Badwater are almost impossible to find today)
- Overload of cosmetics and flare which takes away from the original art theme (once again, more of a personal one for me) 

Now, i am rating the game based on all of the time i've spent on it, not just its current state. I think it is safe to say that the game is not at its best and has some major issues, but to be fair, it has been running on fumes for some time now. Some updates were amazing, some less so but it was always new and refreshing even though some aspects were not for everyone. I find myself a bit nostalgic about the past state of this game and i do play it less today. However, i still come back to it from time to time for a quick game on a public server even after 1700+ hours. 

To sum up, an amazing experience which i would recommend to anyone who enjoys Class Based Team vs Team shooters with various objectives.  

P.S.: I have briefly tried mods which attempt to bring the ""genuine"" TF2 experience back to the game such as TF2 Classic and TF2 Gold Rush. I do recommend everyone who is a fan of this game to try them out. Even though both have a rather subjective take on what TF2 originally should be like, they do make me feel like i am going back to a more simpler time without the overload of cosmetics). I think newer players should check them out as well (more for the feel rather than the mechanics and balance which do not resemble the past reality).

440,english,False,"In its current state, I cannot recommend Team Fortress 2. To anyone.

I love this game, I've loved this game since I started playing it, but the only real way to play it now is to join the very limited amount of community servers with specific rulesets that aren't the vanilla game or don't run the standard maps in rotation.

Valve has left the game in a borderline unplayable state since Meet Your Match released and have done little to nothing to fix it. Casual mode (and by extension Competitive mode) are horribly buggy messes that should have never been introduced into the game. A matchmaking system is entirely antithetical to what Team Fortress 2 is; a casual pick-up put-down first person shooter. Until this issue is addressed, my review will remain negative.

HEAVY UPDATE!!??",1763342849,4343.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5
440,english,True,"This game is (almost) a gold standard of balance that can hold both the test of time and extreme conditions. Community tinkering and experience have pushed this game so far and the depth of the game means that almost 18 (!) years later the playerbase is still kicking and rabid as ever.

There's not much that can be said about this game that hasn't been discussed at least 3 times over, however I will still point out one of the flaws that strikes the hardest to me, that being the weapon balance.

The stock classes themselves are fine and show a lot of tweaking and thought into their designs, however some items that were added after initial release do not show this consideration, such as the Homewrecker for Pyro, the Vaccinator for Medic and also some of the weaker weapons like Sun on a Stick for Scout, Red Tape Recorder for Spy or the Eviction Notice for Heavy.

This game overall is great though, and many criticisms about game balance were unanticipated on Valve's part or are tied into the map design of popular maps added by the community.",1763339838,95546.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The Administrator: ""Intruder Alert! A RED Spy is in the base!""

[Signs illuminate on a large security panel: ""Intruder Alert', 'RED Spy' and 'In Base'; pull out to reveal the BLU Soldier watching the board]

Soldier: ""A RED Spy is in the base!?""

[Intruder Alert begins to play. The Soldier reaches from off-screen and pulls a Shotgun off a rack of weapons. Cut to the Soldier dashing down the stairs and through the 2Fort sublevel while saying ""Hut, Hut, Hut!"" with every step he takes]

The Administrator: ""Protect the briefcase!""

Soldier: ""We need to protect the briefcase!""

[Camera pans to reveal the BLU Scout trying to open the code-locked 'Briefcase Room' door]

Scout: ""Yo, a lil' help here!?""

[The Soldier pushes the Scout aside and begins to 'decode' the combination]

Soldier: ""All right, all right, I got it. Stand back son. 1, 1, 1, umm... 1!""

Scout: Let's go, let's go-

[BLU Heavy comes around the corner, Sasha in hand, charging towards the Scout and Soldier]

Heavy: ""INCOMING!""

[Heavy shoulder-barges the door, destroying it. The three of them are sent tumbling and screaming into the Intelligence Room. The Scout reaches the desk to discover the briefcase is perfectly safe]

Scout: [while screaming, he notices the briefcase] ""AAAAAHHHH- Hey, it's still here!""

Heavy: ""-AAAAalright then.""

Spy: ""Ahem.""

[Camera zooms in to reveal the BLU Spy, with the BLU Sniper's corpse over one shoulder]

Spy: ""Gentlemen.""

[Meet the Spy' Title Card]

[Cut back to the Spy, carrying the dead Sniper towards the desk]

Spy: ""I see the briefcase is safe.""

Soldier: ""Safe and sound, mm-hmm.""

Scout: ""Yeah, it is!""

Spy: ""Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?""

[The other three BLUs shake their heads and shrug]

Spy: ""No? Then we still have a problem.""

[He deposits the Sniper's body on the desk, revealing a bloody Knife in his back]

Soldier: ""...and a knife.""

[The Scout approaches and removes the knife]

Scout: ""Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Spies; they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you!""

[The Scout attempts to manipulate the knife like the Spy, only to cut himself on the finger and drop it]

Scout: ""Ow! No offense.""

Spy: ""If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were not like me."" [The Spy deftly retrieves the knife and flicks it shut, handing it back to the Scout] ""And nothing... nothing like the man loose inside this building.""

Scout: ""What're you? President of his fan club?""

[The Soldier and Heavy chuckle]

[The Spy turns to face the Scout]

Spy: ""No... that would be your mother!""

[The Spy reveals a folder and slaps it down on the table, revealing several compromising photographs of the RED Spy and the Scout's mother]

Scout: [stammers out of shock and disbelief]

Spy: ""Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.""

[[[Right Behind You]] plays]

[The Soldier and Heavy examine the photographs. The Heavy leans over and shows the Soldier one photo in particular]

Soldier: ""Oh!""

[The Scout frantically retrieves the photos as the Spy lights and smokes a cigarillo in the foreground]

Scout: ""Gimme that!""

Spy: ""This Spy has already breached our defenses...""

[Fade to the RED Spy, creeping through the Hydro tunnels. He pauses at a corner, as the camera pulls back to reveal a BLU Level 3 Sentry Gun with its Engineer. He slides an Sapper across the floor, disarming and destroying the Sentry Gun immediately]

Engineer: ""Sentry Down!""

[The BLU Engineer throws his Wrench down and frantically reaches for his Pistol, only to have the Spy shoot him in the head with the Revolver. The dead Engineer crashes through a door and the Spy steps over him and fires at a target off-screen]

[Cut back to the BLU Intelligence Room. The BLU Spy leans over the dead Sniper, gesturing frantically.]

Spy: ""You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!""

[Flashback to the BLU Sniper, now alive and sniping from a dusty attic. The RED Spy creeps up on him and steps on a creaking floorboard, alerting the Sniper, who engages the Spy with the Kukri. A struggle ensues, and the Sniper is ultimately backstabbed]

[Cut back to BLU Intelligence Room]

Spy: ""And worst of all, he could be any one of us...""

[Fade to the RED Spy fighting a BLU Medic, armed with a Bonesaw]

Medic: ""Raus, raus!""

[The Spy breaks the Medic's arm, disarming him. Close-up on the Spy's face as he disguises as the Medic, sans spectacles]

Medic: [gasps] ""Nein...""

[The Spy kills the Medic with a well-placed chop to the throat, knocking off his spectacles, which he catches and wears, completing his disguise]

[Cut back to BLU Intel Room. The BLU Spy looks frantic]

Spy: ""He could be in this very room! He could be you! He could be me! He could even be-""

[The Spy is cut off as his head explodes violently. The camera switches to the Soldier, Shotgun in hand, with a confused Heavy and a panicked Scout]

Scout: ""Whoa, whoa, whoa!""

Heavy: ""Oh!""

Soldier: ""What? It was obvious!"" [The Soldier pumps his Shotgun, discarding the spent shell.] ""He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...""

[The Soldier and Heavy approach the dead Spy, with The Soldier prodding the Spy's foot with his Shotgun]

Soldier: ""Any second now... See? Red! Oh, wait... that's blood.""

[The Scout lingers behind, his expression sinister. He approaches the Soldier and Heavy, retrieving the knife he pocketed earlier, and flicking it open easily. As he approaches, he flickers and melts, revealing himself to be the RED Spy]

Heavy: ""So, we still got problem...""

Soldier: ""Big problem... all right, who's ready to go find this Spy?""

Spy: ""Right behind you.""

[Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays, with the stabbing of the Soldier and Heavy punctuating the beat of the tune.]

[Petite Chou-Fleur plays]

[Fade to the scattered photos of the Scout's mother. The RED Spy retrieves one of them and smiles wistfully]

Spy: ""Ahh... ma petite chou-fleur.""

440,english,True,"I'm reviewing this primarily to review every game in my steam library. So this will have limited value. But I'll do my best. 

TF2 is the foundation of many people's entire selves. It is a game that is fundamentally tied to the fans that have supported it for years on end. It sparked creativity in so many people and has led to some incredible fan works. Some of which being as long and complex as feature films. So how does the game compare to its effects?

It's pretty alright. TF2 is a fun class shooter game that was the early foundation for modern entries like Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, and the like. It is goofy and ridiculous while also being a competent game on top of that. There's a lot of value in creating team comp strats that win you games in fun, niche ways. There are jokes to be had and friends to make throughout your experience playing. It's sort of old feeling, but not so much so that you feel like you're playing a game from the late 2000's. I'm sort of glazing the game because truthfully, it's not entirely my cup of tea. It doesn't need to be though and I respect the hell out of it. 

For new players, I don't know how much I can really recommend this game. It's good fun, but it's got it's issues. The bot issue was made better, but idk if that held since I last heard about it. The player base isn't wholly the same as it once was. You'll get an experience by playing it, but that'll be what you make of it. Just don't expect things to go super ultra smoothly like you're picking up a modern version of this concept. 

Definitely check it out though. For the price of absolutely free, I can't really say no to giving it a shot. Also, the worst that can happen is you hate it and uninstall. This is the foundation for a lot of different things, and if you recognize the game at all or are a returning fan, then you'll have a good time here.",1762068803,137.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Search on your browser of choice ""TF2 wiki: Maps supporting Bots""

Go to game properties and type in -enablefakeip

Go to basic settings then select ""Advanced settings"" from within this menu. Should present you with 2 options: Fast-swapping weapons and Enabling Developer Console. Both are fine.

Tell your friends to do the same.

Now, go in Console,

sv_password (make your own password here)

enter the lobby by picking one of the maps from the TF2 wiki. and typing ""map cp_dustbowl"" [Just an example, dustbowl is a GOATed map that's been around from TFC, so... Other notables include ctf_turbine, pl_badwater, etc. etc.]

tell your friend to do this command in their own dev console: ""Connect (your fake ip); password (Your password)""

BTW the bots can generate nav meshes on maps they have never played before, but these aren't perfect!

You can also try 1v1ing in Arena mode maps if that is what you want. Don't know any?

Players are certainly more competent or aware on average than they were a decade ago, which one may think would lead to better match quality, but they are also more exploitative of the game's poorly designed mechanics and systems, and they speedrun matches so they can get back to the loading screen ASAP. you rarely see players who actually like TF2 for what makes it special and try to achieve mastery of mechanics and instead see a flood of people basically cheesing games to get petty ""victories"" and achieve the fleeting ecstasy that only a subtard could feel upon being told that they ""won""",1759716121,331921.0,True,False,False,9,0,0.545389771461486816

440,english,True,"Team Fortress 2 is a masterpiece that Valve has largely abandoned, yet it refuses to die. Despite experiencing no significant updates, facing a bot crisis, and suffering from balancing issues, you can still hop in and find a surprisingly nice community. Most players are just there to have fun, which is a refreshing contrast to the profound immaturity often displayed in the game.

When you load into a new match, whether casual or community, you meet at least 20 new players. While some are genuinely nice, many are more interested in making connections than actually playing the game. You might even receive a marriage proposal in the chat, often from someone with a name as insufferable as the proposal itself.

The game features nine unique and iconic classes, each offering something for everyone. It’s like a buffet of mayhem! The art style is reminiscent of a comic book, standing the test of time and never looking bad. The Meet the Team videos provide insight into each class's specialties and showcase the game’s goofy tone, while the SFM videos represent a beautiful art form that I hope never disappears. 

I've been playing since 2008 on PS3, and words cannot fathom my love for this game. It has a deep place in my heart, and the late nights I played with friends growing up, hold fond memories. It’s a laid-back game where you can chat and play in the background, sometimes a guilty pleasure, other times a time killer, but always somehow a good time. Despite its flaws, Team Fortress 2 remains a favorite, likely always will be, and may it live forever, continuing to evoke a sense of nostalgia and connection.",1757144778,49928.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.5

But I still find myself incredibly attached and involved. TF2 is the kind of game that doesn’t need updates to live on, and is instead propelled forward by the community around it. This game has a lot of fight in it and an even bigger army of fans behind it. I hope to see it prosper on now and in the far future.

440,english,True,"Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful
sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a
terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful
prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower
for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek
Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can
do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now
Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew
your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast,
back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted.
Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25
pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small.
You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance.
Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy. Five
shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don't let them do it! Next. What do you
got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh,
go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. You
boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I
love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He
can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen house
fly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way!
Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under
arrest. And transport you to designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I
say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you
talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there
with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There
was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends? But I... I don't have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Hey
wait a minute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and me in green fighting machine.
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't
mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you
definitively need some tic-tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've ??? my note!
Just like the time... ...and then I ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of
my but that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one
here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There's no one to derive me. But you got to have
free ... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend
would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... ...really tall? No!
I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really?
-Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I
like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: ""I don't care what nobody thinks of me"" thing. I like
that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like
that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's
amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess,
you don't entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have
in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they
won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can
I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't
how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick
together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only. -Huh, thank you! A,
what are you do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories. And in
the morning... I'm making waffles. Where do I sleep? Outside! Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know, I
don't know you and you don't know me... ... so I guess, outside is best for me. Here I go. Good
night. I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside. Sit by myself outside, I guess. I'm all
alone, there's no one here beside me. -I thought, I told you to stay outside. -I am outside. Well
James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have? It's not... What a lovely bed. -Got
you! I found some cheese. Awful stuff. -Is that you Gordon? -How did you know? Enough! What are
you doing in my house? Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table! Where would we supposed to
put her. The bed's taken. What? I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre! What do I
have to do, to get a little privacy? Oh, no! No, no! What are you doing in my swamp? All right, get
out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go. And hurry up, hurry up. No, no, not there. Not
there! Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them. Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What? We were forced
to come here. -By who? Lord Farquaad. He ??? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do. I know where he is. Does anyone else know where to find him? -Anyone at all? -Me.
-Anyone? Oh pick me, I know! Me, me. Ok, fine. Attention all fairy tale things! Do not get
comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up. In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right
now and get all off my land and back where you came from. You. You're coming with me. All right.
That's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city
adventure. I love it. I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again... What did I say about
singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Well, can I hummer? -All right. That's enough. He's ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man. You monster. I'm not
a monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world. -Now
tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me. I've tried to be fair to you, creatures. Now my patience has
reached its end! -Tell me! Or I'll... -No, no, not the buttons. Not gumdrop buttons. All right! Who's
hiding them? Ok, I'll tell you. -Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man? -The muffin-man.

If you're not that, do yourself a favor and play Marvel Rivals, because I'm sure whoever is reading this hates Overwatch for... uh. Reasons? I'm sure they have their reasons. 

Team Fortress 2 is a very rare instance of being a game that has what I'd like to call a 'flashbulb' version of it because it hasn't gotten a single substantial update since 2017. What you play today is what you'd be playing in 2017, with the only difference being a dwindling player base and a massive influx in cheaters. Unfortunately, the bot crisis was never fixed and if you dare to step foot outside of the cheater-infested Valve servers, you'd be submitting yourself to some of the most heinous online experiences that you'll ever have through community servers. 

Trade servers are dead, Valve servers are infested with bots, community servers are overrun with people that don't play the game. Team Fortress 2 is truly a game that you had to play during the golden age because you didn't know how much the genre could be improved until Overwatch came out and set a new bar.

The Administrator: ""Intruder Alert! A RED Spy is in the base!""

[Signs illuminate on a large security panel: ""Intruder Alert', 'RED Spy' and 'In Base'; pull out to reveal the BLU Soldier watching the board]

Soldier: ""A RED Spy is in the base!?""

[Intruder Alert begins to play. The Soldier reaches from off-screen and pulls a Shotgun off a rack of weapons. Cut to the Soldier dashing down the stairs and through the 2Fort sublevel while saying ""Hut, Hut, Hut!"" with every step he takes]

The Administrator: ""Protect the briefcase!""

Soldier: ""We need to protect the briefcase!""

[Camera pans to reveal the BLU Scout trying to open the code-locked 'Briefcase Room' door]

Scout: ""Yo, a lil' help here!?""

[The Soldier pushes the Scout aside and begins to 'decode' the combination]

Soldier: ""All right, all right, I got it. Stand back son. 1, 1, 1, umm... 1!""

Scout: Let's go, let's go-

[BLU Heavy comes around the corner, Sasha in hand, charging towards the Scout and Soldier]

Heavy: ""INCOMING!""

[Heavy shoulder-barges the door, destroying it. The three of them are sent tumbling and screaming into the Intelligence Room. The Scout reaches the desk to discover the briefcase is perfectly safe]

Scout: [while screaming, he notices the briefcase] ""AAAAAHHHH- Hey, it's still here!""

Heavy: ""-AAAAalright then.""

Spy: ""Ahem.""

[Camera zooms in to reveal the BLU Spy, with the BLU Sniper's corpse over one shoulder]

Spy: ""Gentlemen.""

[Meet the Spy' Title Card]

[Cut back to the Spy, carrying the dead Sniper towards the desk]

Spy: ""I see the briefcase is safe.""

Soldier: ""Safe and sound, mm-hmm.""

Scout: ""Yeah, it is!""

Spy: ""Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?""

[The other three BLUs shake their heads and shrug]

Spy: ""No? Then we still have a problem.""

[He deposits the Sniper's body on the desk, revealing a bloody Knife in his back]

Soldier: ""...and a knife.""

[The Scout approaches and removes the knife]

Scout: ""Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Spies; they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you!""

[The Scout attempts to manipulate the knife like the Spy, only to cut himself on the finger and drop it]

Scout: ""Ow! No offense.""

Spy: ""If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were not like me."" [The Spy deftly retrieves the knife and flicks it shut, handing it back to the Scout] ""And nothing... nothing like the man loose inside this building.""

Scout: ""What're you? President of his fan club?""

[The Soldier and Heavy chuckle]

[The Spy turns to face the Scout]

Spy: ""No... that would be your mother!""

[The Spy reveals a folder and slaps it down on the table, revealing several compromising photographs of the RED Spy and the Scout's mother]

Scout: [stammers out of shock and disbelief]

Spy: ""Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.""

[[[Right Behind You]] plays]

[The Soldier and Heavy examine the photographs. The Heavy leans over and shows the Soldier one photo in particular]

Soldier: ""Oh!""

[The Scout frantically retrieves the photos as the Spy lights and smokes a cigarillo in the foreground]

Scout: ""Gimme that!""

Spy: ""This Spy has already breached our defenses...""

[Fade to the RED Spy, creeping through the Hydro tunnels. He pauses at a corner, as the camera pulls back to reveal a BLU Level 3 Sentry Gun with its Engineer. He slides an Sapper across the floor, disarming and destroying the Sentry Gun immediately]

Engineer: ""Sentry Down!""

[The BLU Engineer throws his Wrench down and frantically reaches for his Pistol, only to have the Spy shoot him in the head with the Revolver. The dead Engineer crashes through a door and the Spy steps over him and fires at a target off-screen]

[Cut back to the BLU Intelligence Room. The BLU Spy leans over the dead Sniper, gesturing frantically.]

Spy: ""You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!""

[Flashback to the BLU Sniper, now alive and sniping from a dusty attic. The RED Spy creeps up on him and steps on a creaking floorboard, alerting the Sniper, who engages the Spy with the Kukri. A struggle ensues, and the Sniper is ultimately backstabbed]

[Cut back to BLU Intelligence Room]

Spy: ""And worst of all, he could be any one of us...""

[Fade to the RED Spy fighting a BLU Medic, armed with a Bonesaw]

Medic: ""Raus, raus!""

[The Spy breaks the Medic's arm, disarming him. Close-up on the Spy's face as he disguises as the Medic, sans spectacles]

Medic: [gasps] ""Nein...""

[The Spy kills the Medic with a well-placed chop to the throat, knocking off his spectacles, which he catches and wears, completing his disguise]

[Cut back to BLU Intel Room. The BLU Spy looks frantic]

Spy: ""He could be in this very room! He could be you! He could be me! He could even be-""

[The Spy is cut off as his head explodes violently. The camera switches to the Soldier, Shotgun in hand, with a confused Heavy and a panicked Scout]

Scout: ""Whoa, whoa, whoa!""

Heavy: ""Oh!""

Soldier: ""What? It was obvious!"" [The Soldier pumps his Shotgun, discarding the spent shell.] ""He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...""

[The Soldier and Heavy approach the dead Spy, with The Soldier prodding the Spy's foot with his Shotgun]

Soldier: ""Any second now... See? Red! Oh, wait... that's blood.""

[The Scout lingers behind, his expression sinister. He approaches the Soldier and Heavy, retrieving the knife he pocketed earlier, and flicking it open easily. As he approaches, he flickers and melts, revealing himself to be the RED Spy]

Heavy: ""So, we still got problem...""

Soldier: ""Big problem... all right, who's ready to go find this Spy?""

Spy: ""Right behind you.""

[Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays, with the stabbing of the Soldier and Heavy punctuating the beat of the tune.]

[Petite Chou-Fleur plays]

[Fade to the scattered photos of the Scout's mother. The RED Spy retrieves one of them and smiles wistfully]

Spy: ""Ahh... ma petite chou-fleur.""

The bot crisis has finally be solved, so casual is fixed (for now). 

Dislike: Updates are anomalies (there's one coming out of the blue in a few months for MvM, but it's 100% community made). There is no real direction for the game going forward outside of maintenance. Only really two seasons now (winter and Summer) which are both 6 months long. Would be nice if we got at least three (Winter, Summer, and Spring). At this stage of the game, crate keys should be a dollar cheaper. Or at least more chances to get a hat/cosmetic as a regular weekly drop.  New class weapons are also never coming now that the game is so old. Old updates were canned (like invasion, or Heavy update). If Valve made TF3, would we even want to move over to it and lose all our stuff?

It is a massive shame Valve no longer seems to game what makes it into the game due to lack of quality control, because this was once a consistently beautiful looking game. So much love has been put into creating a world for these characters, the lore, cinematics, map visual cues.. real shame all that is now burried under this rug made of bright nonsensical cosmetics and terrible update decisions bloated with maps, taunts and cosmetics that frankly just don't fit the game..

But despite all the issues current TF2 has, i think the game offers you more than i had hoped so when i started playing.

440,english,True,"Timeless masterpiece, unfortunately, it's only updated enough for it to be playable and in no fault of the now small development team. 

This game keeps me coming back after so long due to two things:
-It's endlessly customisable and satisfying game play. Dominating the entire server through nothing but skill and manipulating the game's engine to perform wild stunts, outsmarting opponents, has provided me with one of the most addicting game play loops a multiplayer game has ever had.
-The community surrounding it; still alive after almost 2 decades. It may seem toxic at first (as with any multiplayer FPS game), but I have enjoyed so many heartwarming and hilarious moments with random players thousands of miles away that I will probably never see again. 

The humour and inside gags within the player-base stretch beyond the game and into social media. I started watching Team Fortress 2 videos long before I even bought the game. Compilations and fan animations still appear in my YouTube recommended after several-month-long breaks between gaming sessions, as I laugh along with people from 18 years ago to the same stupid jokes.
I hope to remember this as more than a game, but a major part of my younger life. It meant, means and will mean so much to so many people.

I didnt think think this would become an essay lol. 

TL;DR -
Game is cool, people who play it are cool. Pls update Valve",1752277674,64269.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

This game is my childhood, I can't lie it's tough to play sometimes these days with all that's happening on screen, especially in community servers, but you can't deny this community is hardy.

Even if this game was crap, TF2's 'Meet the Team' series would make it a 6/10 on it's own by relation. But it's not so bad, lovely controlled chaos with intermittent blatant homophobia and racism, internet standard.

Suppose I should do a review...
Okay, so this is one of those games where you don't need any level of experience beyond just standard PvP FPS stuff to get into it. However,
-paid content includes having fun, in-game chat*, storing more than a handful of items
-lots and lotsa toxic players, they don't normally interact with people beyond dominating lobbies though
-source(TM)  jank©
Jank includes anything from the unintended demoknight, battle medic and Pootis sub-classes all the way to backstab flings, that one window on pl_frontier, and a lot of weird reasons for getting stuck on things. The game traces its roots back to a HL2 mod and as such has matured over a long time. There's a grand old well of user generated content you can get into for free on a lot of community servers, which is a great way to have fun or play warioware if you don't want to pay for it. Seriously, check out the custom maps people make, it's incredible. 

Game culture you might want to know about: 
-Friendlies: usually seen dancing in groups, crouching with melee weapons or doing other funny shit. Killing them is normally rude, unless the whole server is dancing. At that point, I'd consider it okay to re-queue for something else or start using your tauntkills.
-Pootis: a quasi-friendly species, the Pootis is found in ctf_2Fort and many other gardens of slow gameplay. Though some are un-adorned heavy players, one can easily tell a pootis by their behaviour and colourful, often whimsical plumage. They most typically sport a beanie with tassels and a sandvich in hand, with other colourful garments seen often. They are typically friendlies. If you attack them, they may stop at nothing to kill you in a demeaning way. They may attack first, in which case the winner is whoever tauntkills the other first.
-If someone dies suddenly, with no attacks made, they have used a 'killbind'. It is a common joke. To make your own:
     1- open settings from within the game. From the popup for changing controls, select [Advanced...] -> [enable developer console]
     2- with the console enabled, hit `~ key (top left of keyboard)
     3- don't worry about the code, you're not going to hack anything (probably)
     4- enter this phrase without the quotes: 'bind k kill' and press enter
                         (you can select another key to bind but k is easy to remember and not used by default)
     5- disable the developer console, it's really annoying mid-game. 

*this is a counter-measure to some serious bot issues that have, thankfully, been resolved at the time of writing. Thank you, valve

BUT it has been neglected by valve to a extent that for a good time casual was unplayable because of the aimbots and when the community was tired of valves neglect the got of their butt and actually did something with TF2 and fixed the bot crisis for now. But the reason i love this game so much so much in fact i played during the bot crisis everyday (Because i didn't know Uncletopia severs existed). Was the characters, all 9 classes have funny and memorable lines My favorite voice line from the game is when you dominate a Demoman as Soldier he says ""Scotland is not a real country You are a Englishman with a dress!"" But what really got me to even pick up this game was content creators on Youtube, Im going to list off all the TF2 Youtubers that made me want to play this game , LazyPurple, UncleDane, Big Joey, TheWhatShow , Elmaxo, Great Blue, Jontohil2 , Shork, OrisTv, Itsfeckin raw, Rtgame, Solarlight, soundsmith, WeezyTF2, and last but not least Zenith, (also everyone on the chucklenuts podcast) This game has impacted my life in many ways like most of the Valve titles but Tf2 holds a special place in my Heart.

Had to make him nut cause his balls were blue

He slides in and out my ass like he’s cleaning out gutters

I like his ass cause it’s thicc
He gonna fuck my butt till I shit
And dick is dry so I spit on the tip

Four big guys and they bust on my eyes
They eat my ass, just like apple pie
If they keep fucking me like this I might just die
They pipe my booty till I cry
He lick my dick and the cum start dripping
I took a bite out of his ass it tastes like lemon pepper chicken
He throw me up in the air my booty flipping
He dug his balls in my booty like he's Scotty Pippen
Met the nihha last night
Then I rode his dick like a bike
He’s so thick, he looks like a dyke
But that’s okay cause I think his name Mike
Jordan, he fuck me while recording

440,english,True,"I told myself I would write a review for this game when the time was right. This game has allowed me to meet some pretty incredible—and awful—people. A lot of the game involves mic spam, unfair matchmaking, and crits. But every now and then, you meet some truly amazing people.

As someone who struggled with making friends and social skills, this game has been my home. Over my 10 years of playing, I’ve learned that Team Fortress 2 constantly challenges the phrase, “Now I’ve seen everything.” You’ll always find new experiences, many laughs, and a community that—despite its rot and age—still loves the game.

(Minus the horrid people on the TF2 Emporium. Valve, you really need to address that and do a better job curating.)

I joined this game near the end of its heyday and the beginning of its sunset era. I’ve met friends in real life through this game. I’ve also seen a lot of people move on from it. Real life is important, and the people in it matter. Every once in a while, I check in on people I used to play with years ago. Some are doing just fine; others, not so much. Some are in college, others are getting married, and some have kids now.

That’s why this review, albeit small, really hits home for me. It doesn’t end with updates. The mods, maps, hats, people, weapons, characters, and more all add to the game. TF2 isn’t just a game—it’s an icon.

Thank you to everyone who played this game with me over the years. To the friends who read this that I met in TF2, you’ve given me a timeless memory, and I won’t soon forget you. I look forward to playing with everyone again soon.",1747196771,180645.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

440,english,False,"Oh, Team Fortress 2, you glorious, aging dumpster fire of a game still chugging along like a 2007 jalopy with a “Honk if You Love Hats” bumper sticker. Once a shining beacon of class-based shooters, TF2 has devolved into a bizarre social experiment where toxic players and brain-dead strategies collide in a cacophony of voice chat slurs and rocket-jumping regrets.

Let’s start with the community, because nothing says “welcome” like a 12-year-old moron named ""Piller Croc"" screaming the N-word through a $2 Walmart mic, threatening to kick you to let his friend in, while his teammate ""xX_SniperGod420_Xx"" types “EZ” after missing 17 consecutive headshots. The player base is a toxic stew of tryhards, trolls, and weirdly aggressive newbies who’d rather flame you for picking Engineer on offense or for running a back burner Pyro than, say, actually play the objective.  Oh you wanted to play as a sniper?  You're going to have to run that past ""冰雪Ice snow"" who is playing his preferred class, but takes issue with you doing the same, k thx.

Then there’s the gameplay, where the meta hasn’t evolved since the Bush administration. You’ve got players clinging to strategies so outdated they might as well be written on parchment. “Just stack five Heavies on the payload,” says MedicMain69, with the unshakable confidence of a flat-earther at a NASA convention. Meanwhile, the Spy mains are still trying to pull off the same knife trick they saw in a YouTube montage from 2012, oblivious to the fact that everyone’s got a PhD in paranoid back-checking by now. It’s not just that these players lack imagination it’s that they’re so smug about it. They’ll lecture you on why their 0-12 Scout run was “tactical” while you’re busy capturing the point solo.

Most of the tactics around the weapons were learned from a YouTube video from 10 years ago but the game has since changed, just these morons keep insisting to ""crouch in front of the tank and shoot up with the phlog!"" Without realizing that you can do more damage over time with literally any other flamethrower from the side.  ""bUt mY fAvOrItE tWiTcH StReAmEr sAiD sO!!"" is their only retort.  If they'd only play the game instead of watching someone else play the game...

And don’t get me started on the “geniuses” who think spamming “Need a dispenser here!” while standing in spawn is a personality trait. The confidence-to-competence ratio in TF2 is off the charts. You’ll see a Demoman sticky-trap his own team’s spawn door, wipe the squad, and then have the gall to call you a noob for not “predicting” his galaxy-brain play. It’s like watching a toddler proudly present you with a crayon drawing of a war crime.

Have I told you about the players who are so good they require an entire team of ""expert players"" to win?  Yep.  Sure fire way to tell you're on a quality server is the guy named ""Gregarious"" crying about how his entire team is worthless (except him, of course).  He's the best phlog pyro that ever lived to helplessly watch the bomb be delivered.  You can sense this occurs on every server this ""Greg"" joins.

The game itself? Still fun, in a masochistic, “I guess I’ll play one more round” kind of way. The mechanics are tight, the classes are iconic, and the art style is timeless. But Valve’s neglect has left TF2 feeling like a haunted amusement park: creaky, understaffed, and overrun by gremlins who think they’re running the show. Bots still plague servers, updates are rarer than a polite voice chat, and the hat economy is somehow more stable than crypto.

In short, Team Fortress 2 is a paradox: a masterpiece of game design dragged down by a player base that’s equal parts toxic, stubborn, and dumber than a sack of hammers. If you can stomach the cesspool of humanity and laugh at the absurdity of it all, it’s still worth a spin. Just don’t expect anyone to say “gg” unless it’s dripping with sarcasm. 2/5 stars—one for the game, one for the memes, and zero for the guy who just called me a “filthy casual” while rocket-jumping into his own team’s sentry.",1747111371,143554.0,True,False,False,4,2,0.50079876184463501

Instead of encouraging the individual to host their own servers or join others, Valve chooses to take the bandwidth and discourage community servers by filtering traffic. 
Where then players are greeted by bots, unbalanced teams or 10 minute matches that nobody gets to stay in after. The threat of bots is always alive as long as Valve continues to funnel the majority of tf2's playerbase into their own servers, where they do little to no moderation.

Valve should bring back the ability to select teams, in order to keep games balanced. Valve should also bring back the quickplay system. It kept both Valve servers and dedicated community servers populated. And matches within community servers are allowed to go on for hours, meaning you can play on the same map/gamemode to your heart's content.

Tf2, as a software, was developed by Valve, yes. But its very experience was developed by the community FOR the community. Don't let anyone tell you Valve can replicate it through their servers alone.",1745172330,39303.0,True,False,False,16,2,0.499812453985214233

The vast array of different weapons to choose from for each class makes this one of the most constantly fun class shooters of all time. I used to play overwatch a lot and although there were way more classes to choose from none of them fit exactly how i wanted to play.

the voice acting is amazing. this game alone inspired me to want to become a voice actor. R.I.P. Rick May, fly high you magnificent bastard.

Story is OK, but side content is miserable, usual open world mindless fodder, actual ""missions"" are either buggy, boring, or a mix of both.

The obnoxious cd projekt red launcher adds another hurdle for no reason, and shoves in your face that intel gpus don't work well with it, ""your drivers are out of date"", as I've updated them just before playing, and their link sends you to Nvidia. Embarrassing.

On top of that there is nothing to do in this game outside of driving/fighting while doing missions. There are arcades everywhere, but no games, unless you count the Chrome offline Dinosaur game as a deep/interesting minigame. I found a pool table once that I could interact with and got super excited... only to find out the interaction was just a single time animation. 

Until you get to the DLC content the side content is worse than GTA3 tbh. You just show up at locations and sneak by or kill everyone.

Combat feels good

1091500,english,True,"Writing this review after finally beating the game for the first time on a 335 hour playthrough in which I did essentially everything possible to on a single playthrough and close to maxed all achievements.

I'll start by saying it's rare for me to finish a large, sandbox RPG like this. Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout, sit among the many ""started but never finished"" games that just couldn't hook me long enough to play through a multi-hundred hour game. Cyberpunk did that for me.

I think the reason for that, which was unexpected to me, was not merely the beautiful setting or addictive and face past action; it was the narrative. Installing Cyberpunk for the first time, I was expecting an ""okayish shooter"" to pass the time. Instead, I got a deeply gripping narrative filled with characters I came to care about and consistently dark and soul crushing decisions with real consequences.

Cyberpunk 2077 is the story of V, a girl (or guy) who just wanted to live, but has had that choice taken from her. Its story boils down to the decisions V makes while on a quest to cure herself, while also trying to balance her morality and protect the people she comes to care about along the way. But Cyberpunk isn't a place for happy endings, and it never felt like there was a right or wrong choice, just ones I could live with more than others.

Cyberpunk was a rare and unexpected treat that has absolutely earned its place among my all time favorite games.",1766533253,20134.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,english,False,"I genuinely don’t understand what they did to this game or why. 

I had well over three tone displayed in game (modded sometimes didn’t count playtime). 
I was excited to get into the new DLC with my character, only to learn that it’s essentially impossible. 

They fundamentally changed literally every single system in the game. 
All of them. 

Not like… a little tweak here and there. Fundamentally, every aspect of how the game once worked, is now different. 


Here’s everything I noticed in the 4 hours I forced myself to suffer through it:
-You no longer derive stats from equipment. 
Every gun you pick up will do the same thing the guns you already have do. Maybe it will look a little different, or use a a different ammo… but the damage numbers are identical. 

Same seems to be true of even the legendary weapons. 
Your damage seems derived from your stats, skills, and chrome (cyberware). 

-Clothing no longer provides armor, save for a very select few. 

Every scrap of cloth you get is worthless. Some offer mild bonuses and like… set options… but those bonuses are marginal at best.

All the armor you’re gonna get is gonna come from Chrome.

-Cyberware is now your primary and only mechanism of gear-based progression. 
It determines almost everything you do, and no longer functions the way it used to. 

You are now hard-limited by your physical cap of how much chrome you can have. That seems primarily to be determined by your skills/attributes and character level/rep. 

-you no longer use healing items the same way anymore. It seems like you are given a certain number of heals per fight, and that’s that. Weird design choice. 


I dunno. I can’t figure out who this game is for now.",1766527115,8566.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002

The power scaling needs to be worked out better too, seeing how even on the hardest difficulty youre basically a god at level 20.

All things considered id say its a 3.5/5 stars. The story is pretty lacking for how big the game is, and the power scaling is just ridiculous to a point that the game becomes very trivial early on.

1091500,english,True,"I got kind of addicted to this game right away. I bought it finally for the first time about 14 days ago, I've already put in 90 hours. Besides being unhealthy, that should tell you something about the quality of the game. I started my character on a whim when I had a break from work, said I'd just do the character creation. Picked the corpo lifepath. Right away, I was kind of hooked. Walking around my office, trying to figure out the relations between all of my superiors, I had no idea how deep this rabbit hole went. I thought Jenkins and Abernathy would be people I would need to know, people who would be with me for the entire game. By the time I got to the six month training montage with Jackie, I was seriously excited. And the next day when I finally had the time to sit down and play for 6 to 8 uninterrupted hours and did the Heist mission, holy crap. 

This game is incredible. It has its flaws, but if you love open world games, first person shooters, deep character customization, roleplaying games, good characters, good story, freedom within missions to complete them however you want to, devs that reward careful planning and scouting, but also dont punish you for running in guns blazing and gorilla arms swinging... you'll love Cyberpunk 2077. The world alone is worth the price of entry. It's just a stunningly beautiful world. If you're on the fence, buy it. I highly doubt you'll regret it. 

I put off my purchase for four years just to make sure all the bugs and kinks were ironed out. And although I'll still get run over by an invisible car every once in a while, or see a physics bug make a car go flying across the city, these moments are few and far between, and simply  add to the dangerous charm of Night City.",1766512309,5440.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,english,True,"[h1]A successful dystopian adventure[/h1]

This game does the cyberpunk genre justice. You move through a city driven by corruption and greed, ruled by wealthy mega-corporations. The dystopia feels real because it builds on experiences we recognize from our own time, just without regulation or control. The whole city is packed with ads on every corner: weapons, gambling, sex.

The top earners in the corporations act and think just as morally questionable as the criminal organizations underground, which gives the hopeless dystopian vibe a lot of credibility. Everything is loud, flashy, and broken in one way or another. It’s a world where nobody cares about you and you shouldn’t expect any empathy. People are exploited and used for maximum profit.

The setting is very coherent, and the characters feel believable in their actions and attitudes regarding the reality they live in. The gameplay is solid, but it’s a real shame that a game with such a strong focus on customization doesn’t offer a third-person view. The soundtrack is phenomenal and adds a lot to the atmosphere.

Many side quests can be approached in different ways depending on V’s abilities, and some side characters have surprisingly deep storylines that can really hit you. And Night City doesn’t hand out happy endings out of goodwill.

Driving doesn’t feel particularly satisfying, but on foot the game plays quite well. There are also lots of small details you can discover while exploring that have little or nothing to do with the main story, yet contribute a ton to the setting and overall atmosphere.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a sprawling open‑world RPG where you wander, shoot, hack, flirt, and occasionally get shot while looking fabulous in leggings with neon spikes. Once notorious for being a buggy mess at launch, years of patches and expansions have turned it into a very positive experience loved by a huge playerbase — with lots of story, choices, and post‑launch improvements still drawing crowds every night. 

Pros:

Deep Night City with tons to do and explore 🌆 

Strong story & memorable characters (Phantom Liberty adds even more) 🧠 

Still huge, still popular — even years later with a very positive Steam rating 📊 

Cons:

Not perfect — bugs and odd behaviors still crop up sometimes 🪲 

RPG mechanics and some systems can feel a bit uneven depending on playstyle 

Verdict:
From disaster at launch to beloved cyberpunk RPG, this is now one of the most talked‑about open‑world games out there. Recommended if you like story‑driven RPGs and neon‑soaked chaos — especially on sale. 🎮",1766484546,3192.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The detailed world-building in Night City is unparalleled, with intricate narratives and complex characters that kept me hooked from start to finish. The freedom to explore and customize your experience is truly remarkable, and the modding community has only expanded the game’s potential, making it even more enjoyable.

What sets Cyberpunk 2077 apart is its blend of deep storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and a dynamic, living world. It’s a game that rewards exploration and creativity, and it’s easy to see why it’s become one of my all-time favorites.

yes i wiped the cache, yes i re-verified the integrity of the files, yes i clean re-installed it.
nothing works!
i contacted the devs, they replied with telling me to try all of the steps i listed above when i was clear in my ticket that i had already tried everything.

I waited until the 2.0 update and the Phantom Liberty DLC dropped to dive into Night City, and I can honestly say it was worth the wait. This is, without a doubt, one of the best single-player RPG experiences I've ever had. The game has achieved a level of polish and immersion that few titles can match.

The Story & Characters: The narrative is incredibly compelling, mature, and emotionally resonant. V's journey is an emotional rollercoaster, elevated by brilliant performances, especially Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand. The side quests are where the game truly excels; they are often better written than most other games' main stories, filled with depth, moral ambiguity, and memorable characters like Judy.

The World: Night City itself is a visual and atmospheric marvel. Every neon-lit street corner, towering skyscraper, and gritty alley feels alive and meticulously detailed. Driving around with the amazing soundtrack playing while the rain reflects off the puddles is an experience in itself.

Gameplay & Combat: The combat is fluid, fast-paced, and incredibly satisfying. The reworked skill trees and cyberware system offer a huge amount of flexibility, letting you become an unstoppable netrunner, a chrome-plated brawler, or a stealthy assassin. The choices you make genuinely impact the world and how missions play out, adding significant replayability, that is until you leave Hanako waiting at Embers until our Sun will end its life by expanding into a red giant, engulfing inner planets like Earth, then shedding its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind a dense, Earth-sized stellar core called a white dwarf that slowly cools and fades over trillions of years. 


CD Projekt Red has delivered on the game's original promise, transforming a rocky launch into a genuine triumph. If you held off because of the initial reviews, do yourself a favor and pick it up now. This is a must-play experience.",1766455911,312.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

The world feels alive, chooms: corpos scheming, street thugs hustling, and fixers dropping gigs like hot data shards.

The combat? Preem. Whether you’re blasting gonks, slicing with monowires, or quickhacking enemies into flatline mode, it feels slick once you’re chromed up. The story hits hard too—full of moral gray zones and moments that make you stop and think, like a real braindance.

And the achievements? Absolute nice to grind (expect for some endings ) but nevertheless nice to spend time on them—pure nova. Each one feels like scoring serious eddies, rewarding you for exploring every dark alley and wild build Night City has to offer.

Sure, it had some rough patches back in the day, but now it runs way smoother and feels like the game it was always meant to be. If you’re into deep stories, open-world chaos, and that high-tech low-life aesthetic, this one’s worth the jack-in.

1091500,english,True,"Yes but with huge caveats.

One, some of the dialogue is off (it's usually the blue side questions that sometimes seem unaccounted for).

Two, some of the main stories feel truncated. Others don't. 

These first two complaints can be reasonably defended by the size of the world and story they were trying to tell. Given the immense scope of the game, they aren't particularly damning.

But the game being janky as hell years after release (and after claims that 2.0 polished the game) is really inexcusable. I honestly think Red bit off more than they can chew with worldbuilding, but whatever. Let's get specific.

The cars and driving generally is just chaotic. I mean, personally, I wish devs would just stop putting cars in games until you can reasonably drive them without fishtailing all over the place. BUT maybe I'm just bad at driving.

BUT even if I am bad at driving, the autopilot justifies my complaint even more because even it can't drive well. First time I pressed autopilot the vehicle literally turned left and plowed into a wall. It consistently did this. It also consistently just ran into the back of cars. And at one point there was a car pile up that the game's engine clearly didn't know how to resolve, so it blew all the cars up. One car fell right next to me, upside down, the people inside looking deadpan (but not dead).

It breaks immersion.

And I wish that was all that broke immersion. I tried several times to do stealth and the game said ""no thanks."" And it wasn't my fault, either. One time I put down a body I just knocked out. No one was in the room. No cameras. No nothing. Suddenly everyone in the building gets alerted. Apparently this is a glitch where if a body is moved into a wall, the game engine freaks out and pushes it out. But this can sometimes be interpreted by the engine as making a loud noise like a gunshot. So screw me.

I shouldn't have to fight the NPCs and the engine.

The engine couldn't figure out which UI overlay I was in several times. For instance, there was one time when I could only see a conversation when I used by cyber optics.

People walking through walls. Bodies buried under objects, observable only by the loot sign. So on and so forth.

These things break immersion, and a game like Cyberpunk 2077 relies heavily on immersion and tonality (it's literally why they chose the first-person view and not the third-person view).

The mechanics are sometimes dubious. I had a hard time choosing what guns I wanted to run. SMGs and pistols use the same ammo. Apparently pistols do more headshot damage, and SMGs spray more bullets. But I could never figure out why I'd really choose one over the other. I think you could reasonably run through the game with one gun (probably a pistol) and never bother with any of the other guns, so why bother having so many types?

And the mechanics sometimes worked in weird ways. One time I wanted to merely incapacitate people in a building. There's ammo for this. Pax ammo makes all your shots non-lethal. So I equipped on a single shot weapon, the smart sniper rifle. Good, yeah? Can't go wrong. One high-damage bullet and they all go to sleep.

Nope. Apparently with a high-damage shot, the ""gore"" mechanic registers with the engine before the ""pax"" mechanic. So if you do a shit-ton of damage (like you'd do with a headshot from a sniper), you blow their head off no matter what. This wasn't explained and ruined the quest.

It's not just that the mechanic isn't explained, it's that the conflict between these divergent mechanics (gore vs pax) seems stupid. If I choose pax ammo, that is a very intentional choice as a player. I very clearly want to be non-lethal. So depriving me of that just because of how the gore mechanic works seems counter-intuitive to good gameplay.

And, honestly, lots of things feel ""lazy."" During two quests, bodies, people, and cars disappeared as I was walking along. This is aggressive clearing by the engine, freeing up resources for whatever scene comes next.

A lot of games use gentle clearing, removing these assets to free up resources when you, the player, aren't looking. This preserves immersion.

But this engine used aggressive clearing. In one case, I was in a room that was just before a big boss fight. I walked up to some characters and initiated dialogue and the room cleared right as the conversation started. This isn't a coding issue; it's a staging issue. The assets should've been cleared not when the conversation started but when I moved to the next room and the door closed behind me. Instead, the devs just wrote a code to free the resources up as fast as possible, not bothering to keep immersion intact.

And again, immersion is paramount to this style of game.

Defenders say the aggressive clearing is needed because the game is so resource heavy. I find this doubtful because, again, it's a staging issue, not a coding issue. If you know a quest is coming, put reasonable measures in place to keep the clearing hidden. Put in an extra room. A dialogue that stops me from moving. Something.

The story is good, though. Phantom Liberty is definitely the highlight. But overall, the reason it gets a thumbs up is because I found it enjoyable overall, even if a bit annoying.

Beyond the wonderful and deeply immersive gameplay, what truly elevates it is the philosophical core. The game doesn’t just show a futuristic city; it explores where humanity might be heading. Corporations, AI, the Blackwall, transhumanism, Soulkiller — all of it ties into unsettling questions about identity, consciousness, and what it really means to be human.

The idea of copying a mind, losing the self, or existing as something almost human creates a genuine existential tension that sticks with you long after you stop playing. Night City feels alive, oppressive, beautiful, and tragic all at once.

The main story is a bit short, side “Gig” missions can feel repetitive, and progression caps too early, but these issues don’t outweigh the experience.

Overall, a very strong and immersive game that I absolutely recommend.",1766397122,3382.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5
1091500,english,True,"Absolutely masterful.  Whatever issues may have plagued this game on launch - as of 2025 (going into 2026) - software here is spotless.  The story and [i]game[/i] underneath shine as brightly as I imagine was intended from the get-go.

I didn't rightly [i]know[/i] what I was getting into here.  I have no prior experience with CDPR games, so the writing took me by surprise.  If I had to expect anything, it would have been another Skyrim - a long list of checkboxes to tick and a rote, tired gameplay loop that gets boring as quickly as you reach the end of it, padded out by bullet sponge enemies or simply making you [i]walk farther.[/i]  A bunch of faceless, soulless PG-13 robots that exist to push you along to the next theme park ride.  But that's not at all what we've got here, not by a long shot.

I look at this, look at the hours I've put in here, in what feels like such a small amount of time, and I do not consider one minute of that time wasted.  Of course, there were issues, but they were so infrequent that experiencing the issues themselves stood out to me.  The fact that any occurred at all made me realize how seldom they happened.  There is no 'filler' here.  Everything that exists does so for a purpose, and of the time spent just going from A to B, there was always something fun to do in between, whether that was some kind of side-thing, or just the movement itself.  Everything was done fantastically.  Of the issues I had throughout my time with this game, all of them were either forgotten or resolved themselves before the end.

Truly the only issue that hasn't been fixed is that there isn't [i]more[/i] to some of the narratives, but nothing feels like it got the MGSV treatment.  Nothing here is half-finished or cut short, the game's lore doesn't just exist stuffed away in audio or text logs - though there are plenty of the latter if you like reading.  Some things just end on a cliffhanger.  Things you're never meant to know, maybe.

This game isn't the kind you can make a sequel to, I don't think.  At least not for another decade or so, give or take some kind of narrative epiphany.

The story was written by people who understand how people speak, and did not pull punches for the sake of pleasing either the player themselves or the PC in-universe.  There [i]are[/i] cases where you have to make decisions and you cannot do everything you can possibly want in one playthrough.  There are decisions with consequences that will affect how you play, and more importantly, how you [i]feel[/i].  You can savescum of course, but the only one you're cheating is yourself.  Robbing yourself of the experience you've just invested hours into seeing through.  This is not a game for the guy who wants to save everyone.  There's no all-seeing god looking over you to lower your score at the end for killing people instead of knocking them out.  There's just you, the world, and your conscience.

The topics covered in this game's story, among other things it holds, have always been extremely interesting to me in particular.  There are so many parallels here to things I've personally dealt with in my life, things I've already had to consider, problems I've solved or thought I had solved, now staring me right back in the face, in a way that seems as real as any sort of digital ""reality C"" can possibly ever be.  It may as well be real, with how it f-cks with my head.  I guess that's just art, isn't it?

This game made me change as a person, for the better.  Sounds dramatic, but that's the truth.  Through all the sci-fi bullsh-t, I see bits of myself in this thing.  I have walked away with new, perception-altering experiences tucked away somewhere in my brain, to inform my behavior down the line, am I to ever find my way into these situations again.

Maybe now I'll put together what being alive means.  I've got the pieces right in front of me - Disco, NITW, and the rest from my time in meatspace.  Maybe this was the last one.",1766395509,4033.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

Granted, most of the large issues such as crashes (Most of the time) or overall surface presentation have been resolved in due part to patches. However, I question whether or not this approach to game design is going to work out for studios when they can't even out develop a game from a decade ago or more. There are multiple arguments or conversations to be had about why the game shipped in such a state for the initial release, but it doesn't help everything has to be reworked and tacked on due to poor planning. Such additions don't feel natural personally and very awkward during a playthrough. 

I can at least praise the concept/art/music aspects of the game or even the general plot of the story, but interest just falls off for both areas so quickly after Act I. It would at least hold up in some regard if it played like an RPG, but a lot of times you are forced into doing whatever the scenario wants you to do.

1091500,english,True,"Truly awesome game, just beat it for the first time but feel like I only scratched the surface. So many different ways to go right up until the very end. The game lets you play the way you want most of the time, except for the (arguably) forced stealth missions. But stealth in this game is typically more forgiving than other games where stealth missions feel like a chore.

The game looks great, though may take some tinkering with graphics settings depending on your setup (I was on AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, RTX 4070 and 32GB DDR5 RAM, frame gen got me to a consistent 150-160 fps on high settings iirc). The game also sounds great and stuff like vehicles, guns and voices sound great. The main character male voice sounds like a major douchebag, which may or may not be your thing. I haven't heard the female MC voice, but many seem to prefer her.

Characters are where this game brought me back to the days of New Vegas. Through all the game's bullshit bugs and lack of elegance at times, the story, world and characters kept me coming back for more. I plan to come back to the game to complete it with different endings, paths, etc.

Overall, great game and I definitely recommend it for people looking for a fun RPG with plenty of content that can potentially last you months. It may seem a bit overwhelming with all the NPCs calling you so much and with how big the world is. But take the dive and you won't regret it.",1766361012,1342.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

No cutscene outside the endings, all story and interactions and rendered in game and happen seamlessly between gameplay and it's incredible in how revolutionary it is. The characters are so in depth and believable and it's so interesting to dive into them and understand their personalities and viewpoints. I am so incredibly attached to the characters in this game, Jackie, Panam, Judy, Victor, Johnny, Rogue, Mitch, Claire, River, Misty, Goro, Reed, Alex, So Mi and so many more. I love them all and I can only hope we can get even more content around existing characters in other Cyperpunk instalments.

Until now. Man, what a comeback. What a STORY. I played 80% of the game in vanilla 2.3, and THEN I modded it and WOW. It's like an entirely different game both times. There's a ton of depth, a ton of different ways to play. Stealth? Done. Shoot em' up? Done. Cars? Weapons? Almost unending variations, then mods will add even more if you wish. Every time I turn down an alleyway I haven't explored, I find something new to do. 

The story progresses at a rate that gives you a chance to relish in a feeling or a mood, but still moves along fast enough that you can spend an hour each evening and feel like you accomplished something.

Just buy it if you haven't tried it, and if you like it as much as I did, there's an expansion that added almost an entirely new main story worth of content.

1091500,english,True,"I'll start by saying that I'm not the type of person to play through the same game twice, very rarely do I even buy the same game for multiple platforms. As of writing this, I'm playing through Cyberpunk 2077 for the fifth time across Xbox and Steam. It is that good.

The gameplay and customization is great. You really can go at most scenarios however you wish, be it stealth, guns blazing, turning enemies on each other, or even charging in with a plastic meat stick. There's a solid perk system that allows you to create some interesting, highly specialized builds.

The story is well written and entertaining, even the side missions and filler tasks have their own little stories that occasionally tie into the overall plot. I have found myself actually getting lost reading logs and listening to dialogues just to see some of those webs that the writers at CDPR created.

The setting and visuals are amazing. There's a reason this game has been used as a benchmark over the last five years, but beyond that, it truly is something to see the neon filled, futuristic dystopia that is Night City.

1091500,english,True,"Controls are awkward, do wish in settings you could remap controller keybinding.  Game assumes I'm using mouse, but only using keyboard/touchpad.  

And slight pauses, like in conversation, game hangs after you respond, makes a bit awkward.  I'm assuming this is because I've got a budget gaming laptop.

Other than that, this game is immersive, incredible graphics, has style, flair, personality, darn good storylines, easy to get lost in it.  I never played Grand Theft Auto, so this is 1st time playing a game this gritty.  My current player, studly dude wearing increasingly more girly makeup, and plan is to have him swap genders once he makes enough money for a sex change operation.  

Currently, I think what cracks me up the most...  I'm a stealth, patient player.  Can wait aeons, calmly, for enemy to make a mistake, then snipe them from afar.  So hunkering down behind a defense, in shadow, while enemies are yelling at me from afar calling me ****, all sorts of taunting, like being on grade school playground.  Makes me LOL literally.

Being able to pull out my gun and shoot somebody in the face who'd been domestically abusive, shoving women around, is quite cathartic.  

The level of detail is impressive.  Like, scenery, billboards, advertisements, urban design, bars, characters, so much depth, attention to detail.

EDIT:  it does the thing i hate.  you spend so much time building a character, getting invested, then the game just randomly kills that character, forces you to spend an unnecessarily long amount of time stuck between an endless series of cinematic sequences, then forced to do restricted activities, frustrating, as an underpowered character you don't care about cuz the game killed the character you were invested in.

still a good game.  i'm mentioning this in case this is the kind of things that bugs anybody else.  god, it's like warframe's new war quest all over again.",1766281591,1331.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,english,True,"After following this game's hype train from its 2013 trailer to launch, I guess my unfilitered dog-shit opinion is warranted. Unless you've been completely offline for half a decade, you'll know that this game's debut was one of the most controversial and damaging game launches seen up to that date. Fast forward 5 years and you'll see many praising this game as ""one of the greatest comebacks ever bro!"" thanks to constant patches that were necessary to keep CDPR's reputation from sinking to the ocean floor, and an excellent anime launched nearly two years after the base game. I would never call Cyberpunk a ""bad game"" by any means, it's just if you ever stop to look at it in context, you'll see the broken promises, lost potential, the voids left behind by story rewrites, and an ultimately hollow feeling world.

Since Cyberpunk 2077's identity at launch became more known for its bugs than anything else, other pressing issues were quickly eclipsed behind NPCs walking through walls, cops spawning out of thin air to punish your crimes, and enemies t-posing while using the sandevistan. However gamebreaking (and hilarious), because the bugs and glitches that held the publicity spotlight were getting fixed, people began to forget the fact that the game was a mere shell of what was promised over the course of the 2010s.

I would say that this is especially true after the anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, came out in 2022 and pumped new life and a new fanbase into the game. Most everyone who jumped in after watching the pop-culture phenomenon anime got to experience a completely different game than those at launch. Many new and returning players quickly began to praise it as a complete comeback akin to No Man's Sky. Ironically, Cyberpunk completely swept the ""Labor of Love"" award from No Man's Sky that year at the Steam Awards based on its newfound popularity, which I, and many others at the time, would say was mainly thanks to the popularity boost by the anime. However, many players who had been playing since launch were rather confused by CDPR winning the award, since all they were doing as ""Labor"" was fixing bugs and reversing asinine gameplay choices that should have been ironed out before delivery. They weren't even adding content to the game at that point. Effectively, Studio Trigger carried the corpse of Cyberpunk across the finish line, and CDPR got a crown for it. 

I wholeheartedly believe that CDPR does not catch enough flak for their broken promises and false advertising leading up to the game's launch. This game continues to advertise itself as an RPG, and the actual commercial advertising leading up to the game's launch promised a deep RPG experience akin to the tabletop game. Each of the unique lifepaths you chose for your V were going to have vastly different consequences on the gameplay depending on what you chose. Instead all you got is a flavorful 20 minute section at the beginning of the game according to your lifepath before your character flows into the same overarching story regardless of choice. 

Fallout 4 style branching dialogue runs the show with ""Yes"" (Corpo) ""Yes"" (Nice) ""Yes"" (Snarky) ""No"" (Mean) that ultimately changes nothing for the most part. Sometimes dialogue options can lead to extra bonuses if you choose the lifepath option, such as calming a hacker down with the Corpo option to where she gives you some extra eddies, but that's about it. The only time your choices will actually have an impact on the game is during the end. You will choose your ending and that's it, that's pretty much all the agency that you have. Outside of that, the story of your V will be the same as anyone else's. Even the way you build your character with upgrade points does not really matter since you are granted enough points to build an effective jack-of-all trades. And you can always just respec your character if you feel like your build does not benefit you. If you look at Cyberpunk as an action game with a couple RPG elements, it's a fantastic at what it does, but going off what it was advertised as: Cyberpunk a completely lackluster RPG.

One of the more nitpicky issues I have with Cyberpunk is the game's style and fashion. You might be ready to say ""But Woomy, Cyberpunk is all about style over substance!"" and I would completely agree with you. I would actually argue that base game Cyberpunk has a completely lacking in style for a cyberpunk setting, especially for something that takes place in the flavorful and stylish Cyberpunk universe itself. The base game's clothing options look more like what would be depicted by a stereotypical millennial in San Francisco who thought that mashing the styles of bandits from Borderlands with the fashion choices of the average level 1000 in GTA online would make for the perfect depiction of Cyberpunk's available style and fashion. During your gameplay, you'll find plenty of cheetah print fedoras, leather pants, rusty respirators, and worn out looking military surplus clothes, but nothing that really screams ""high-tech, low-life"" or ""cyberpunk"". If you want to argue with me ""Well the chaotic nature of Cyberpunk is its style!"" please just look at the ads leading up to the game's launch, and then look at the database of clothing options offered in the game. Simply just look at the stylistic differences between the style of the 2013 announcement trailer VS what was delivered in the base game in 2020. Beyond that, the styles that CDPR advertised in their ""Style vs Substance"" advertisement made before the game's launch are not even offered in the base game, making it another complete false promise. You can see them start to get touched upon in the game's DLC, Phantom Liberty, but even there, the list is cut too short for what should have been. It's rather pitiful variety for a game that takes place in a universe that's about people desperate to look, feel, and be unique in a world wrought with nihilistic consumerism. You can still tell that the game's amount and variety of clothing options were designed to fill the game's loot pool when it was running off of the horrid armor/clothing stats system that hindered the game at launch by forcing people to run around in underwear and netrunner headsets for the sake of stats. Now, the stats are gone, but the lacking fashion choices remain.

Ultimately, I would say Cyberpunk did not even begin to shine until its DLC, Phantom Liberty, came out. It could be said that wherever Cyberpunk fell flat in polish, character agency, style, and story, Phantom Liberty addressed it and fixed it within its own complete package and amazing self-contained story. It honestly feels jarring going from Phantom Liberty and back to the comparatively unpolished base game. Ultimately, Phantom Liberty left me wanting more, even when I knew I could not ever have more.

All in all, if you are going to buy Cyberpunk, please remember that it is ultimately not an RPG where your choices matter. It's an action game with a few RPG elements and a solid story that lacks polish literally everywhere besides the beginning, and the end. It's one of those games where if you ever stop to really look at it, you can still see and feel so much of the lost potential and broken promises around every corner. I can recommend the game with what it currently offers, but I can only recommend it if it's on sale alongside Phantom Liberty, as I feel like that is the real Cyberpunk 2077 experience.

That's why I stopped playing before, because I didn't have time to waste. Alas here I am writing this review instead of playing. 

TLDR. It's okay. Melee is fun. Guns are unique and boring the same. Feel pretty good to shoot, especially as you level up and fine tune. But you'll quickly discover each playthrough/character is very specific. You use SMG on this guy. You use swords on this guy. You hack with this girl. Top all that off with the fact you can only respec your character once. Why? So I'm forced to play the awful story missions, again? 

The bugs are out of control. The crime system is still incredibly lame. Driving vehicles is, again, okay. This isn't an RPG. You can't do anything and be anyone. You are V, the person who will run the same boring mission and die the same way. Again. And again.

1091500,english,True,"Story:
Probably the best story in a RPG open-world game. A lot of twist and turns, engaging. None of the take this go there type of quest, each quest is waiting to suprise you in every turn. Some of the best character written as well, each of them feels unique and almsot actually alive. Hands down best endings in a RPG, none of them feels out of place, all of them logically make sense and feel like its something a real human can choose. And the Phantom Liberty DLC is what every DLC in a RPG should be like.

World:
Developers did a wonderful job crafting the world of cyberpunk, I will say it is the most immersive experience I personally have ever played in a -first/third person RPG. From the colour palet, intricate use of light and shadows between streets, to the ambient sounds, cyberpunk is a world that truly draw you in (or make you feel uncomfortable cause of how horrible life in NC is). 

Balance/different play-style:
The game used to be quite unbalanced, meaning certain play-style is significantly more rewarding than others in every difficulty. With the patches given with Phantom Liberty, I can say the skill tree is quite balanced, meaning you can use every play-style in every difficulty and be effective. Granted in the hardest difficulty there are certain play-styles that are easier to be effective, but other ways of playing works too. So you won't feel like you have to choose a particular way to play the game just because that is easier.

Bugs:
Like any game, this game has bugs. None of them game breaking. The npc T-posing and vehicles spawn out of nowhere bugs from the early days are gone. 

Mods:
There are so many mods, you don't need any of them to make the game playable, but there are some very good mods that can cater to the kind of experience you prefer in cyberpunk, and make the game even more immersive than it already is. I personaly recommend the Nova city mods, make the lighting in the game much more realistic and in turn, makes NC's different districts looks even more distinct than it already is.

1091500,english,True,"Cyerpunk had a rough start, as we all know. It released as a shell of empty promises and ambitions that the developers had for the game but couldn't or wouldn't be able to implement in time for release.

CDPR redeemed themselves over the years by fixing this game, and righting the ship. Right now, it is a masterpiece, with an incredibly good story and realized near future dystopian world that is straight out of the genre bests like Blade Runner, The Matrix and Akira. It wears it's influences on it's sleeve but it stands on it's own.

I truly think it might be CDPR's best game now, even after the rocky start. Phantom Liberty injected such life into this game, as well as the 2.0 (and subsequent) updates that overhauled the game systems, RPG elements and progression to be just flat out better. 

The best thing about this game is the story has meaningful choices to make. It has a somewhat open-ended world but a strong, character driven narrative that doesn't pull it's punches. There are consequences to your actions and several endings that reflect that, and your relationships with certain characters can definitely change depending on what you decide to do. I love this and I wish more games had meaningful story moments like this.

Gameplay has been so much improved from it's release that it doesn't even resemble it's original build. Everything is just so much more fun and streamlined (for the better) now in the latest updates that I feel like different builds and playstyles really stand out. 

I highly recommend it to everyone, except I strongly suggest you have a decent computer to run this. This game is playable on older hardware but you're doing yourself a disservice by not being able to use Ray Tracing and some newer gen tech (like Frame Generation) to take advantage of how great this game can look and play. I upgraded in the middle of my third playthrough and was blown away at what I was missing out on.

Don't be a gonk, play Cyberpunk.

This game does not revolutionize story-writing, gameplay, cinematography, open-world, RPG systems, and many other elements it contains, but it certainly excels in each one of them, providing a product of life-changing quality. Its story is amongst the best ever written, in general. 
The game is not without flaws, as nothing is, but they're so minor, they turn bleak when compared with everything else that's being presented on the table. Yes, the police system is still a bit shallow, yes occasional bugs still appear, although the game has been fixed in a major scale; yes you still cannot romance Takemura, but all of that falls apart under the weight of its positives.

1091500,english,True,"I finally caved and bought Cyberpunk 2077 about a month ago. I'd been avoiding it since the 2020 launch disaster, but choom... I regret waiting this long.Night City is straight-up intoxicating. I started as a streetkid netrunner, and I'm already 42 hours deep with no signs of stopping. The main story hooked me hard—Johnny Silverhand in my head is equal parts annoying and iconic (Keanu Reeves kills it), and the Heist mission had my heart pounding. But the real magic? The side content. Every gig feels like its own little cyberpunk short story. The Panam quests out in the Badlands are peak—riding with the Aldecaldos, that sunset convoy scene? Chef's kiss. Judy's storyline hit me in the feels too; CDPR really knows how to write romance that doesn't feel forced.Gameplay is addictive as hell. Quickhacking enemies from across the street while chugging a NiCola is god-tier fun. Swapped to a gorilla arms/monowire build for a bit and now I'm ripping doors off cars and slicing through gangs like butter. Driving finally feels good (thank you, patches), and the gunplay has serious weight. Graphics on my RTX 3080 with path tracing? Night City's rain-soaked streets look unreal—neon reflections everywhere, crowds that actually feel alive.Phantom Liberty is next on my list—heard Dogtown and Idris Elba are worth it alone. Only complaint so far: I wish there were more apartment customization options, but that's minor.If you're still sleeping on this in 2025, wake up.

1091500,english,True,"I’ve been watching Cyberpunk 2077 from a distance for nearly five years, following its patches and improvements without playing it. In 2025, I’m finally jumping in so this review reflects the game as it exists today, not the problems at launch.

At its best, Cyberpunk 2077 shines in its hand-crafted spaces and curated missions. Clubs, bars, and districts like Japantown or Corpo Plaza feel dense, intentional, and visually exceptional. When the game narrows its focus to authored content, it works extremely well.

Where it still struggles is the open world. Traversal is slow and unrewarding, vehicle handling is painful, and the game compensates by flooding the map with fast-travel points which is a clear admission that moving through Night City isn’t very fun. The streets between major locations often feel like filler rather than meaningful gameplay space.

Random encounters like NCPD alerts, cyberpsycho sightings, and gang activity all lack depth and consequence. Over time, they blur together, encouraging a blunt “kill-on-sight” playstyle rather than supporting role-playing. 

That said, the game is absolutely still worth playing and buying. I’ve been borderline obsessed with it for the last two weeks, which hasn’t happened to me with a game in a long time. The cyberpunk aesthetic, lore, and curiosity about Night City carried me deep into the experience. The game also works surprisingly well as a “turn your brain off and go loud” RPG. I’ve been playing my character like a full cyberpsycho no stealth, killing everyone on sight and it feels oddly aligned with how the game is designed.

I can easily see myself replaying it later with a stealth-focused build to explore a different side of the systems. Even with its flaws, Cyberpunk 2077 in 2025 is a compelling, addictive game especially if the world and genre already speak to you.",1766248928,1788.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Pros:
-Story of both the DLC and Base game has insane depth and is rich in lore.
-Gameplay is extensive and engaging, from hacking, shooting, slashing, worth multiple runthroughs.
-The world is vast and dripping in detail. Nothing feels unfinished and truly pushes the limits of an open world experience.
-Visuals are insane..

Cons
-Street NPCs sometimes feel empty. However, cyberpunk does it better than most other open world games.
-Tutorial can feel quite long and there is a learning curve, but once finished you will be helplessly immeresed.

This game is the greatest available in the genre of open worlds and cyberpunk.

1091500,english,True,"Completing Cyberpunk was a powerful experience. I want to share my thoughts while the emotions are still fresh.
First of all, Night City is not just a set; it’s a living organism. And the characters make it live. Jackie Wells has become a real bro for me. His attachment to his mother and sincere love for Misty make his image human and worldly. His vitality, ambition and sincerity caught on without trying to appear as someone else. His loss is felt acutely, not just the death of a loyal friend, but the loss of a sense of security. The city suddenly becomes empty when the only person who believed in you without any hidden motives disappears.

Special thanks to the developers for Judy. Stunningly written character with a solid character, behind whose external harshness hides an aching soul. Her strong independence and anarchist spirit combine with an inability to cope with emotional problems and a tendency towards self-destruction. Despair, sabotage and emotional problems seem very real, not just a perfect option of romance, which makes her journey more impressive. Great empathy caused the similarity of this character with me, forcing to engage in self-analysis. Not just an admiration for the character, but a chance to better understand yourself. It serves as a kind of mirror reflecting my inner conflicts, fears and desires. It shows that you can be both strong and vulnerable, idealistic and realistic, that you can fight injustice while seeking inner peace. Her story is a reminder that even in the darkest world you can find light and hope, and it’s normal to open, even if it’s scary.

The ending of Arasaka is remembered for a long time, dark and psychologically difficult. In exchange for the promise of life you give up your freedom and dignity. In this ending you understand that for Arasaka you are not a hero or even an ally, but a valuable asset or just a lab rat. Friends from a past life either distance themselves, or look at you with pity.
The space station scene where V endlessly solving the Rubik’s Cube is a brilliant way to convey mental decay. You repeat it again and again, but it does not bring satisfaction. It is a symbol that the V's mind is damaged, and Arasaka simply calibrates the remnants of your personality. When V in rage or despair disassembles the cube and finds a red devil inside, this is the moment of truth. It’s the realization that there is nothing human inside you anymore, only corporate code. You survived, but the price of this life was so high that life itself lost its meaning.

One of the drawbacks for me is the lack of a canonical end. I appreciate when there is a clear conclusion in the narrative, where everything is wrapped up and understood. Not when you have the option to select a favorable outcome for yourself. It's preferable to have one clear conclusion. Even if it leads to disappointment.

This game is definitely worth getting lost in.",1766232153,9779.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Now, 5 years later, and with the Phantom Liberty DLC, I thought: let's give it another go. Did not regret. I can't describe how pristine and alive this world feels. Mind you, I've never enjoyed a game more on replay than the first playthrough, but this time it's definitely more fun. It's immersive, the story is good, just doing your own thing in Night City feels good, naturally even, and there's so much to do that does not feel like a grind or repetitive at all.

1091500,english,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 is the kind of game that boots up and immediately asks: “What if capitalism, chrome, and bad decisions had a really good soundtrack?”

Why It’s Actually Incredible Now:
Night City is one of the most immersive open worlds ever made. It feels alive, loud, dirty, and dangerous.
The story hits hard. Characters are memorable, messy, and painfully human.
Combat is flexible: guns, hacking, blades, stealth, or full cyber-psycho blender mode.
The game looks insane. Like “stop and stare at puddles” insane.

Things You Should Know Before Plugging In:
This is a story-first RPG. If you skip dialogue, you’re missing the best part.
Builds matter. Random perks = sad V. Plan ahead.
Driving is better than launch but still… let’s say “stylish chaos.”
Bugs are mostly gone, but Night City still believes in character.

Pro Tips for New Runners:
Don’t rush the main story. Side quests are where the soul lives.
Read shards and messages — the worldbuilding is hidden everywhere.
Invest in cyberware early. Flesh is temporary, chrome is forever.

Emotional damage is unavoidable. Save often.

Final Verdict:
Cyberpunk 2077 went from cautionary tale to redemption arc done right. It’s immersive, stylish, emotional, and genuinely memorable. Not perfect — but bold, ambitious, and finally delivering on its promise.

1091500,english,True,"The coolest videogame city. I sometimes wish I lived in Night City. I played this in 2024, 4 years after release, and only remember a bug in the prologue where npcs were stuck t-posing in a cutscene montage. Hopefully this game served as a lesson to CDPR. Surely they made serious internal changes to their marketing team because what it is now is a great game in its own right, thanks to the developers who had to clean up their mess (also shoutout to Mike Pondsmith).

The combat is the most fun I've had in a long time. Enemy camps offer versatility (long sightlines for sniping, hacking opportunities, secret stealth routes) and I often changed combat methods during fights. The grind for clearing out locations did not feel tedious at all. The rpg elements include character creation and combat playstyle. The only choices you make are how you want to deal side quests and the ending for the main story. Another thing is, the game has an awkward rhythm since the prologue is lengthy and the main questline is very short comparatively.

I'm not always invested in videogame plots, but V's story ended up working for me emotionally. There are also a handful of memorable side quests where the stories fit perfectly in the bleak cyberpunk setting, my favorite being Sinnerman. The DLC doubles down and gives an even more bitter story with Songbird and Reed.

As for negatives, I would've liked having some more compelling side characters (Misty and Panem were all I cared about in the main game). Keanu's voice acting was ok, Grimes should not have been allowed to voice anything. There are a bunch of megacorps established the Cyberpunk 2077 universe but this game mainly features only one, Arasaka. There was a side quest that seemed like it was starting a plotline dealing with another megacorp called Militech but it went nowhere, which was disappointing.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a neon-soaked, morally ambiguous playground where you can customize your implants, drive ridiculously fast cars, and somehow survive a city that seems determined to kill you in at least three creative ways per minute.

The world of Night City is breathtaking — dense, vibrant, and packed with stories waiting to unfold. The characters are memorable, the quests are often hilarious or heartbreaking, and the main story is engaging enough to make you care about a bunch of people who are probably going to get cybered anyway.

Combat is slick, hacking feels satisfying, and the driving physics are… well, let’s say fun in a destructive way. The bugs exist, sure, but sometimes they’re so ridiculous you can’t help but laugh — like when a NPC phases through a wall while screaming existentially. Classic Cyberpunk.

If you enjoy open-world RPGs, absurd cybernetic enhancements, and a city that refuses to play nice, Cyberpunk 2077 delivers a wild, unforgettable experience.

That's what I was told before starting this game for the first time. I didn't think much of it but after advancing through the main story I began to understand what this actually means. Sure you can be the main character, a legend of the Afterlife, Corpo scum or just a regular guy trying to stay alive but no matter what you do, this city will put you to your knees in the end. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is much more than just a game, it is something that you can be part of. You can be stranded in the middle of the badlands with no human in sight but then you spot a car off the road and decide to look what has happened, upon arrival you see a NCPD officer covering up his tracks after killing someone they weren't meant to off. Upon getting too close you get shot and have to make a decision. It's you or them! After helping yourself with staying alive you can uncover the whole situation. The officer just wanted to feed her family and the payout for the gig was too good to pass on. You look down on the ground, her lifeless body right infront of you and you start to realize that this city doesn't need you. It breathes and goes on no matter if you're there or not.

I just can't help myself getting immersed in these kind of situations. Daily biz that shows you the dreadful reality of your life in this city. Barganing with someone you are meant to flatline just for them to tell you that they were screwed over by some corpos and it's not their fault, really let's you think about what you're doing.
In other games i just get the quest, fulfill the requests, maybe listen to the dialouge as to why this was sooo important to the quest giver and then move on.
In Cyberpunk 2077 I indulge in the jobs and gigs given to me. Letting a fixer only have a few gigs available and unlocking more once you earned their trust and proven your worth really lets you feel like you have a connection to the other characters, They aren't just NPCs, they are your Employer, your fellow merc and sometimes your choom.

Never have I ever felt so much about an NPC dying as I did in this game. It felt real in a way. You learned so much about them over the course of the story that it really hits you when they are suddenly gone and you can see the pain in their buddies faces. The first time I finished an ending and the credits rolled I just sat there and thought about everything that had just happened. For the first time in a game I intentionally let the credits finish rolling and didn't even try to skip them. The calls of all your chooms and fixers, after you completed the main quest hit right where they need to and I started to really feel sorry for all of them. Because no matter what fun you had with them, no matter how close your were and how deeply you cared about them, in the end ""Night City always wins""

This is not supposed to be a review, it is a love letter to the creators and the characters in the story they created. With almost 300 hours on a single save i have yet to experience everything this game has to offer and i'm looking forward to the sudden thought of wanting to indulge in this world again.

It was a preem experience and no matter what Night city throws at you, I always strive to be a Legend again!

1091500,english,False,"TLDR; I picked the game up on sale for $20. I could have spent that on a loaded Chipotle burrito and produced a more satisfying pile of shit. 

Once you get past the unique backstory prologue (which takes just enough time to pass the refund threshold, for some crazy reason /s) the writing becomes boring, predictable, and weak. There are no stakes to the game at all, they gloss over/montage away the only interesting part of the story (getting a foothold as a Merc after your prologue), and then there is a huge cast of random people calling you constantly that you supposedly met and formed tight bonds with in the part THEY SKIPPED. All of the expository parts of the story are all tell, and no show, with only one real visceral moment at the end of the first heist. However that moment is fully robbed of any and all interest and stakes, because you literally have never met or heard of the people involved until the 5 minutes before things actually happen. 

And then there is the completely false promise of ""impactful decisions that ripple into the fabric of the story"". There are approximately three choices you make that actually change anything about the story, and one of them is what gender you make your protagonist (spoiler alert: it just changes which two people you can romance. That's right. 4 options, and two are blocked dependent on what body type you pick). 

""You have two weeks to live!"" - you can sleep for months of in-game time and nothing bad happens. 

""You are an integral part of this power struggle!"" - All of the people involved in the power struggle, even those that die by your hand, would have everything that happened to them, happen, regardless of if you are there. 

No stakes. No interest. No impact. No advocacy. Not a worthwhile story.

The combat is mid at best, boring at worst. Character customization does almost nothing impactful for combat aside from unlocking movement options that are unreliable and repetitive. Particularly good at headshots? Too bad, they straight up barely matter because... ummm, pain inhibitors? Combat is trying to give power fantasy while also offering little more for difficulty scaling than increasing hp pools and damage mitigation like this is 2008 WoW. Out of combat, talent builds are more or less just for finding shortcuts in missions and side jobs that are gated behind 'tech ability X/20' and similar random skill gates. 

Dialog is frustrating as well. The game prides itself on not having many cutscenes after the initial exposition montage, but that means that the flow of conversation and dialog is chopped and screwed depending on if your character model is standing the right distance away and facing the correct direction from the NPCs that are supposed to talk next. You are constantly waiting on NPCs to start saying their next line so you can proceed with walking slowly behind them from one location to the next, so you can turn around and go back to where the conversation started so you can actually start the mission. The dialog itself is littered with the jargon of the source material, which is easy enough to pick up as you play, but it feels more forced than natural, and does nothing to try to ease the player into it. I've played for almost 60 hours, and I could not tell you the difference between 'Choom' and 'Gonk' if you put a comically large gun to my head. 

And then there's the launcher. Why. Why. WHY does every single game demand a developer-controlled launcher that does nothing but advertise DLC and other products that, if I am going to buy them, I will get from Steam anyway? Just frustrating. You know what everyone loves about GTA? Not the launcher. 

I have scoured this game for redeeming qualities. I am still working on finishing all side quests and gigs searching for anything to make me feel like I didn't waste cash on this lauded game. But frankly if I could go back in time and stop myself from buying this game, I would tell myself the truth: Cyberpunk 2077 is just Watch Dogs (2014) with a layer of spackle and ray tracing on it. 

Don't bother.

1091500,english,True,"I feel it has to be said - the game ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ is this era’s very own ‘The Wire’.
I realise this may seem a strange thing to say at first, as ‘The Wire’ was a different medium, a television series, set in the real world, at the same approximate dates as it was made, while Cyberpunk 2077 is a CRPG set, not only in a sci-fi future, but an actual parallel timeline to our own.  But this is where the big, important differences stop.
When the HBO television series ‘The Wire’ came out, it blew audiences away with the depth, scope, breadth, and sheer profoundness, in storytelling, quality of acting, use of the tools of the medium, and, if that wasn’t enough, people’s very perceptions of what the limits of the medium used to tell the story were.  The rules of how deep a story could go, how big it could be, how relevant and important to our time and society something made within such a medium could get.
So, when I compare it to Cyberpunk 2077 on those criteria, I cannot find two examples closer.  This game took the very concept of a story told via computerised gameplay, and utterly revolutionised how deep, important, and relevant to our current social issues that story could be.  It blew players, including myself away, as we found ourselves submerged in a world so utterly real and compelling, with such complex characters, deep, rabbithole subplots, perfect voice acting, and mind-blowing atmosphere, that there was no way of leaving that place the same as when we went in.  And it did so with the kind of brilliant, intelligent, and engaging gameplay that perfectly completes anything achieved in this medium.
If you haven’t tried this game, whether you’re interested in the medium as a whole or not, you should play this game.  It is too important to miss.
Tell your friends, tell your neighbours, tell your family, tell your Gran, who constantly complains about ‘young people’ and ‘violent video games’ and ‘millenials being a problem’ for whatever reason.

1091500,english,True,"A Grand Theft Auto, Blade Runner, DeusEx, The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell, Shadow Warrior, mashup; that's the feeling I have while playing Cyberpunk.  It's futuristic nature and grand scale add to the allure.  With all the shiny glitz and pomp the story and music really drive the addiction for me.  The arc, takes you where you've never been, introduces you to people who become as close to family as you can have in a game, and all that, pulls you in and won't let go.  

The skill tree is unique.  It's the way in the game to build your character meaningfully and level up.  The interesting aspect of it is, you can't balance across all skills, you have to focus on specifics.  That makes all the difference.  Handguns in this game are wild, but paired with your own cyber implants, it goes wild.  Smart weapons are fun, hacking them is funner!  

Night City is vast.  It's fun to explore.  While exploring, the radio creates an ambiance that's almost soothing.  I rarely find myself fast traveling anywhere as a result.

This game has been reviewed many many times, so it's impossible to add anything unique here.  I will say however, whether this game intentionally did this or not, it instills a sense of loneliness.  Everywhere you go in the game, you're surrounded by people but usually alone.  When you connect with another in the story-line, they always leave or die.  Again, I don't know if this was intentional, but it's a feeling that follows you everywhere in the game, and it adds weight to everything you do, every decision you make, and every happy, or otherwise, event.

This game still has bugs, and they are often noticeable, but for all it's flaws, after having played for some time, I personally feel as though this has created an entirely new genre of game-play that will be mimicked for many years to come.",1766073327,4466.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002

Cyberpunk 2077 is more than just a game to me; it is an experience that pulls me into a world full of emotion, chaos, and freedom. From the first moment I entered Night City, I felt connected to its atmosphere, characters, and story. The neon lights, futuristic technology, and deep choices make the game feel alive and unforgettable.

What makes Cyberpunk 2077 even more special is how it brings my friends and me together. My friends Cr0w, Smokey, and Tokyo all loved the game as much as I did. We spent hours talking about the storyline, our different choices, and our favorite characters. Each of us experienced the game in a unique way, yet we all shared the same excitement and passion for Night City.

The game also taught me how powerful storytelling in video games can be. Every mission feels meaningful, and the choices you make shape who you become in the game. Playing Cyberpunk 2077 with my friends made the experience even better, turning it into something we all remember and enjoy together.

It's a painfully mediocre game with great scope. A bad product of a good studio, which results in a decent game. 
I would recommend to play this game but do not bother if you have something else on your list.
Several years after a miserable launch of the game and release of dlc, some bugs are still not fixed. It is very playable but far from flawless.
Visually stunning with possibilities to parkour around the city.
Fight mechanics are interesting to explore but not that fun to use throughout the game. You become very strong very fast and the enemies are not that well-deisgned to provide much challenge. The game does not let you change your build more than once so it also limits fun when you get bored of your build.
Lots of characters feel flat. Lots of story lines felt unpolished or butchered in production.
Lots of side quest are locked to the progress of other side/main quests and sometimes you have to wait for hours until the quest becomes active again or you just miss the trigger that you cannot possibly know about and essentially waste a lots of time to be left on a cliffhanger.

The graphics are simply unreachable for any other game—light-years ahead, especially if you use mods. Nothing comes close.

The city is breathtaking, and even after hundreds of hours I’m still discovering locked doors and secret places I’ve never seen before.

It’s true the game isn’t perfect (perfection doesn’t exist), but thanks to the enthusiasm of a huge modding community, if you’re patient you’ll find the mods that fit you, making your Cyberpunk experience unique and personal.

If the game is still so popular and so heavily modded, it’s because of how the developers turned around a product that launched in a disastrous state and made it the masterpiece it is now.

It tolerates you — briefly.

You arrive as V, thinking you’ll make it big.
Money, chrome, reputation.
Night City hears that and immediately schedules your emotional collapse.

Every street is neon, every alley is danger, and every NPC looks like they know something you don’t.
The city breathes, glitches, lies, and somehow still feels alive enough to judge you.

Then there’s Judy.
Quiet, emotional, and carrying more unresolved feelings than the entire city combined.
Her story isn’t loud — it just sits with you, heavy, reminding you that Night City doesn’t just break bodies, it breaks hearts too.

Combat is chaos with style.
Guns blazing, hacks flying, mantis blades out — all while your minimap politely suggests routes you will absolutely ignore.
When things go wrong, they go wrong fast… and usually in slow motion.

And of course, Johnny Silverhand.
A walking midlife crisis with a guitar and too many opinions.
He lives in your head, insults your choices, and somehow becomes the most honest voice in the room.

The story isn’t about saving the world.
It’s about surviving it — long enough to decide who you actually are in a city that wants you replaceable.

• Installed chrome → Lost a piece of myself.
• Trusted Night City → Night City laughed.
• Still chasing legends → Because quitting isn’t an option here.

now heres my experience just in case. ive read other reviews and concerns about the game. personally i didnt have any problems with it like bugs or anything but i get that if its super laggy and keeps crashing you wouldnt wanna play. 

tbh i think to fully enjoy the game and be in a good place you really need time, like you cant just spawn and already have a sandevistan, unfortunately. its more of a slow game like any other similar games where you can speedrun just for the sake of finishing it but you wouldnt unlock everything. i think games like ghost of tsushima/ yotei are quite similar. and at the beginning it may seem boring to some but like thats to get you into the world and story more than anything, so quitting right after the ""prologue"" would be a bit sad. id say you need at least 5-10 hours on it to somehow get into the game.

btw some choices DO matter for quests and endings, maybe not as much as you would think but it still does. and to me the choices make more your personal character and how you want it to be.

for the storyline you either hate it or love it, really depends on what youre into and eve4n so you can never bve sure if youll like one or the other story. i started playing cuz there was a lot of hype and to me it was worth it! and honestly you could play just for keanu reeves cuz his character is great

1091500,english,True,"While Cyberpunk 2077 came out in a half-baked rush state, it's undeniably a fairly polished game now and definitely worth your time if not for one playthrough. Before the long form review, I'll say I've played both the main game and Phantom Liberty twice, of those I played 2/3 lifepaths; however I still have yet to complete all endings, all sidequests, and the nomad lifepath. This means that there's still a lot of side content I never finished due to burnout with the game.

So the long review? Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed but good game that takes the hallmarks of games like GTA and attempts to put a coat of Cyberpunk paint on it, while this does mean the gameplay is fairly strong and CDPR's standard build/playstyle flexibility exists, gameplay can get stale fast in longer sessions; however this is generally made up for by great voice-acting, good to excellent environmental storytelling, and a semi-compelling main narrative. Overall I had fun with my time but definitely not a game that's endlessly replayable or repeatable. 8.5/10

1091500,english,False,"It’s the end of 2025. Most of my friends played this game by this point, and all of them sung serenades for it. “The DLC just made this game goated.” And so, I thought it’s finally time for me to give it a try. Here are my thoughts…

The game is beautiful. The city is finally living and breathing, and works mostly like clockwork. By the point I got to the DLC though, I started experiencing some major stuttering when many NPCs were present on screen, but I’m happy to write this off as suboptimal hardware. Interestingly, the stutters continued even outside of the DLC area, where they previously didn’t occur — not sure why this is. Otherwise, I had just 2–3 crashes over the playthrough. Considering how disastrous the technical state was at launch — a massive improvement. Other impressive things include: the ambience, atmosphere, sound design, environment, and everything else having to do with the world. Outstanding.

Story — wouldn’t call it amazing 10/10 content, but it’s solid enough. What’s noteworthy is that the overarching narrative didn’t stand out nearly as much as some little moments and details, either in main or side missions. These really shined through (e.g. Kerry’s reaction to you playing guitar at his house — my God, that was so cool). This is what really helped with immersion and with keeping my interest — even if I didn’t care much about the story at times, I was still curious about certain interactions characters might have with each other.

Speaking of characters — the writing is, again, mostly solid. 
For me there was a caveat — I didn’t really manage to connect with the majority of them. I did say I enjoyed interactions between characters, but I don't mean the characters themselves. That is with exception of Jackie, having started as Corpo, Reed, and, surprisingly, Brendan (what the hell right?). Many of the characters I didn't hate, but that's not a great achievement. Johnny especially — I was mostly annoyed with him at all stages of the game, which sucks, because he’s the foremost character. The legendary Johnny Silverhand, no more than an angsty teenager. Songbird likewise — the game kept telling me I should care for her... but I just failed to. Judy's quest I straight up skipped — the point of her character flew over my head entirely. Think I maybe understand what the writers were going for: it’s supposed to be a city where everyone’s out for themselves, so you aren’t necessarily meant to like most of the people in it. It’s similar to the show Euphoria in this sense (although on a lesser scale), and there, this point is also by design. If so, I can live with this, even if it's not my cup of tea.

Keep in mind — THIS (all the above) is what you are going to be playing the game for. It’s not GTA, it’s not Skyrim/Fallout, or any of the other AAA RPGs. More notes on why I found it so — below.

Gameplay — I haven’t played with the “magic” system, which I heard was fun, but still — on normal difficulty you are literally just cruising through everything. I’d suggest playing on harder difficulty, but there isn’t an enemy variety to speak of to justify making them bullet sponges. If you’re satisfied with the combat, then maybe that’s OK; personally, I wasn’t entirely.

Here comes the sad part — I really thought that, as my friends suggested, post-DLC, all or most of the initially promised features/fixes would be added. No. From minor things like wall-running, which still isn’t there, to major stuff like police AI still being dumb as hell, driving sucking ass, plentiful and engaging side content like in Witcher 3 being sadly absent, to name a few. For the latter point here, I mean specifically quests such as the meditating monk (either single mission or very short questlines) — there weren’t many such quests, and most of them were a chore to complete. Gigs I also found less entertaining than contracts in the Witcher. I have to stress that this isn't just me being salty about the broken promises. These genuinely felt like core parts of the game were seriously undercooked, even after 5 years of updates.

All of this breaks immersion significantly, but could be forgiven if gameplay and narrative were in tune. Witcher had the same problem, by the way. However, in Witcher it was borderline negligible; here it’s way worse. The game starts, they say you’re on a timer. Mentally, you want to get the important stuff out of the way and then return to side content. Then the game just ends upon completing the final mission — you need to reload a save afterwards. As such, you need to complete every side objective within the span and context of the main story.

So you’re telling me that I have two weeks left to live, and then I can just wait half a year in my room for certain events to take place, finish the story, and then perish at the exact moment it's convenient for the plot?

I have to say that CDPR makes great games, but this is the greatest sin they commit many times — gameplay and narrative just don’t mesh with each other. This also ties into a previous comment — this isn’t a sandbox RPG into which you could/should sink 1000s of hours, The game ends where it ends. However, many design and marketing choices point to it being such. This created an uncomfortable dissonance in my mind as a player.

TLDR:
Didn’t mean for the review to get this long, but I’ll leave it at this: Cyberpunk has its good moments, and it has its bad moments.

To compare it to a movie again (sadly, that’s the best analogy I can muster for now) — if it was a 2-hour-long one, I’d say, “I’m glad I watched it,” and wouldn’t return to it in the future. Here I can say exactly the same thing… but it was 120 hours long.

It’s good, but I don’t think it’s good enough for what it's trying to be.",1765901960,7131.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I played through the entire game at launch in 2020. Back then, with all the bugs and awful optimization, the only thing I could really praise was the story - and even that felt hard to appreciate through all the crashes.

Cyberpunk 2077 is now a legit 10/10. After years of patches and polish, this is finally the game we were supposed to get. The story is still incredible - dark, heavy, with choices that actually made me sit and think. The characters feel real and stay with you long after you finish. This is ""mature"" in the best way - not just edgy violence and sex, but genuinely thoughtful storytelling about life, death, and what it means to be human.

And Phantom Liberty? Absolute banger. Seriously one of the best expansions I've ever played.

I've done 100% completion now. Not a single regret about any hour I spent in Night City. If you skipped this at launch like most people, now's your chance. CDPR really pulled off the comeback.

The game did suffer a lot from early release bugs and issues but these have mostly been ironed out and new features added.

After playing KCD2, Expedition 33 and Elden ring in the same year, my bar was really high, and Cyberpunk passed it with no problems.

The writing for both main storyline and side quests is really good, make you care about the setting and the people you meet throughout Night City. Just to get slapped in the face by the dark reality of this hellhole.

Game is either mid lenght or long, depending how much side stuff you want to do. Which is very welcome after having to spend 120 hours to beat Elden Ring.

Optimization is great, my rig is nothing to wow at, with an RTX 3050 and a 10 year old CPU. Im running constant 60fps on mid-high settings and it still looks great.

One of GOAT beautiful open world games, even in 2025 superb graphics, story, world around feels so alive! 


IN MORE DETAIL:

I'm taking my time with this game and yet to finish it but I would recommend this game even at full price however you do have the option to wait and get it at a huge discount sometimes, which are a STEAL. If you love OPEN WORLD games THIS one is a must have. I mean in what other game can you pick up d1ldo from a gayclub and sneak up onto gangsters from behind and beat them unconscious and put their body into a refrigerator while Keanu Reaves (who's a terrorist living in your head) judges your every move and decision?? 10/10

1091500,english,True,"For almost 7 years, I waited for this game. My excitement started from the early trailers, gameplay demos, all the way to the iconic trailer with Keanu Reeves. It launched in 2020 in a terrible performance state, which made me hold off on buying it back then. But I was confident that after waiting nearly 5 more years, with countless fixes, updates, and patches, the Cyberpunk 2077 I had been longing for would finally be playable smooth, without major issues, and with minimal bugs.

We start by choosing our life path: Nomad, Streetkid, or Corpo. Honestly, I was curious about all three, but I preferred Nomad because it felt the most unique to me. Then we head to Night City to become a higher class, more intimidating mercenary. As for the story, I have zero complaints. I loved the flow from beginning to end: plenty of plot twists, jokes, and sharp satire woven throughout. The only disappointment was that the three life paths only differ in the prologue. I had hoped for much deeper differences, something that would encourage multiple playthroughs. Still, I absolutely loved the story that puts you in the shoes of a dying mercenary constantly accompanied by Johnny Silverhand. The missions offer multiple approaches usually stealth or direct combat, like most games. What really stands out (classic CDPR strength) is the dialogue feels like a movie. A single conversation can easily last 30–60 minutes, deepening both the story and the Cyberpunk world itself. The portrayal of massive corporations with overwhelming power is excellent make you really feel like an ordinary citizen who can’t possibly stand up to what the corpos control.

The world itself is absolute cinema. Night City feels incredibly real and beautiful. Every detail is there: huge corporations, restaurants, brothels, bars, gangs, prisons, and countless small touches scattered everywhere. Weather cycles are varied and gorgeous, like morning, afternoon, night, rain, thick Blade Runner style fog everything is rendered stunningly.

Unfortunately, activities are limited to main quests and side quests. The good news is there are tons of side quests, and they’re very varied not just “kill this, kill that.” Some are silly, some are heavy on dialogue and uncovering secrets. The main story missions are delivered brilliantly; everything is told in detail and clearly if you pay attention to the conversations. Dialogue choices feel meaningful (though there aren’t tons of them), and they do affect the story. Skipping side content has consequences, including on the endings. What I missed was small, low stakes activities to slow down the pace things like eating at restaurants or doing silly random stuff. Because everything is tied to quests, the pace stays fast the whole time, which can make you tired more easily.

V’s cyberware, weapons, and skill trees are great. I love how detailed the cyberware system is you can build exactly what you want, and it has a huge impact on both combat and stealth. The skill tree influences gameplay too, though the options for truly changing how you play are somewhat limited. Weapon variety isn’t massive, but the rarity tiers and four main categories give each gun a distinct feel like rifles, SMGs, melee weapons, and ones integrated with your cyberware. Early game combat and stealth felt pretty rough, but once you upgrade, combat becomes extremely satisfying and deadly while still feeling well-balanced against enemies. The only letdown is the stealth takedown animations—they’re bad and there’s basically only one type.

Graphics don’t need much explanation: this is one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. The immersive, terrifying future city is depicted gorgeously. From the lavish, neon reflected heart of Night City to districts like Kabuki and Santo Domingo with their own distinct vibes, to the rundown, chaotic outskirts everything is portrayed incredibly well.

Vehicles were awful at launch, driving felt terrible. But once you progress, earn money, and buy proper cars or bikes, driving becomes enjoyable. My only complaint is that navigation would be better with arrows on the road rather than just the minimap it’s hard to drive while constantly glancing up.

Overall, I’m extremely satisfied with Cyberpunk 2077 after waiting 7 years for it. The story, gameplay, world, and atmosphere are all fantastic. I’m glad I waited longer so I could play a mostly fixed version without bugs or major issues, I sank almost 70 hours into it, often playing 4 hours a day and losing track of time. I love all the little details: fast travel via metro, clothing and weapon shops, driving around listening to the radio stations (many songs are original and all of them are great). My only regrets are that the main story feels shorter compared to a heavy narrative game like The Witcher 3, and so much content was clearly cut, things like the nano wire hacking, wall climbing with mantis blades, and many features shown in early demos that never made it to the final game. It really feels like the rushed launch prevented the game from reaching its full potential. Still, I’m not fully satisfied yet. I’m still hungry for more Cyberpunk content, which is why I’m so excited to play the Phantom Liberty DLC.

I’m also currently finishing the prequel anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.

And I’m already incredibly excited for the sequel, that I hope it brings tons of surprises and all the content they couldn’t include in this one.

1091500,english,True,"I played this game at release for about 10 hours and was really disappointed. I uninstalled and never played it again until now. What I just played ends up somewhere on my top 20 all time! I can't believe how good this game ended up being. 

The main quest is good, That's all a main quest needs to do. it doesn't shit the bed and ruin everything else. The side content blew my mind. I couldn't believe how engaged I was in the writing behind a tiny NCPD scanner quest on occasion; quests that would feel like radiant, automatically-generated content in other (lesser) games. Gigs seemed like mini-quests as well and yet they were really well written and I can't think of a single one right now that I didn't like. 

The real stars of this game are: 1.Night City itself and 2. The characters. Graphics are never a primary focus for me, but in this case, they really bring the world to life. This is definitely the best looking game I've ever played. I never skipped a single ride in the passengers seat because I just wanted to look out the window and take in the city. There are games with an art style that I appreciate more, but I'd have to really think about it to give anything more credit than this. 

I have a lot of problems with the game. They just get overshadowed by the things I loved. First and foremost, the atrocious release can never fully be forgiven. We've all heard all of those arguments. I don't need to rehash them here. But it was messed up. I don't feel cheated all these years later anymore, but imagine if I bought it on the previous gen consoles. Next, I think this game is horrible at teaching you how everything works. I think the dialogue is great except when they are trying to be cool. Johnny's dialogue has a lot of stuff that just feels silly. I'm not talking about writing generally, I'm talking about style and syntax here. There's also conceptual complexity in the stories background that leaves me a little bewildered. I didn't enjoy the combat until I got a decent sandestivan (sp?). I wish I could have forgone netrunning earlier and just player with slow-mo start to finish. I loved the cars but I felt like all that effort was kinda wasted by the end of my time with the game. There was not enough to do with your car collection. The last one might be a bit controversial, I felt like Phantom Liberty was a step down in quality for me. The whole James Bond spy thriller thing was great, breathtaking even at times. But it still felt like a modest downgrade with regard to the universal themes, genre tropes, atmosphere of the base game. 

I finished a near complete playthrough. I got all of the endings, all missions (that I know of), all gigs, almost every NCPD scanner blip etc. and it never got old. I am even now sad to uninstall the game. I'm really going to miss this place and these people. I haven't felt that since Fallout: New Vegas. I'm not exaggerating when I say, I'm 100% confidant that I could start the game over right now and play it to completion and my opinions wouldn't change. I'm 150 hours in (lots of AFK has my playtime way higher but the in-game timer says 160). That's mental. 

I love it! I'll definitely come back in a few years. This is something special folks. It really challenges my capacity to stay mad at CDPR. Hmm...still won't buy their next release when it comes out though. They have to do a bit more penance for me.",1765855159,17180.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

When Cyberpunk 2077 first launched, it was a disaster. No sugarcoating it.
But today? It’s a completely different game — and honestly one of the best open-world RPG experiences you can play right now.

Night City finally feels alive. The lighting, the reflections, the atmosphere… sometimes I just stop and stare at the world. The soundtrack is insane too — it keeps you in that perfect cyberpunk mood.

✔️ [h1] What I Liked [/h1]

Combat 2.0 is amazing – melee, hacking, guns… every build feels unique.

Perks actually matter now – every point changes how you play.

Incredible story and characters – some missions stay in your head for days.

Much better optimization – runs smoothly on my setup without issues.

❌ [h1] What Could Be Better  [/h1]

Still has some funny bugs here and there — NPCs walking through doors or cars falling from the sky. Night City things.

The police system is improved but still feels a bit teleport-happy.

Endgame can feel a bit empty if you already finished the main and side content.

✔️  [h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]

Cyberpunk 2077 finally became the game it was supposed to be.
If you skipped it before — now is the perfect time.
If you played it at launch — this feels like playing a brand-new game.

[h3]  Highly recommended. Night City awaits.  [/h3] ✨",1765838952,2110.0,True,True,False,0,0,0.5

I had never played a CDProjectRed game before, so have no fanboy memories of the witcher etc etc. 

But Cyberpunk absolutely blew me away with every minute of gameplay.
The world, the combat, the music, the driving, the missions, the sheer amount of content.  

Were there small bugs and glitches? Sure. Did I care? No. Because the rest of the experience genuinely blew my mind so much that I belived for 95% of my playtime - I was a merc in night city. 

I guess one of my biggest 'fears' of this game was my belief that they would use Keanu as a 'star attraction' -  but his character and his story are written so well, that he feels like his own solid identity.

Anyways - If a rich story, great open world with lots of unique missions, stupid amounts of replayability , fantastic voice acting and animations, absolutely sick and FUN to play unique builds interests you, get this game.  After the first five hours, you'll be hooked.

1091500,english,True,"I beat this game quite a while back and having nearly put 100 hours into this game as of today, I couldn't go without writing my review. 

I'll start by saying this game is great. Before playing this game I saw all of the reviews about the story being out of this world and all that, but if I'm totally honest, the story was very slow for me to get into personally. That's not to say it wasn't great, as I did enjoy it overall. The opening of the game is fantastic but I found myself going in and out of interest throughout. Its VERY dialogue heavy, so if you're someone who doesn't have the time and patience to watch the long cutscenes in between the gameplay, then this game may not be for you. But if you're into story based games and are willing to put the time in, then it is worth it. 

The gameplay is one of the strongest things about this game, but it doesn't hold your hand in main and side missions, which is cool for the most part, as your not tied down to complete them in a specific way and your free to find solutions on your own, most of the time.. This was a breath of fresh air! 

I didn't play the game at its release, so I can only judge it by how its been in recent times, and I will say there are the odd few bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking. 

There's actually SOOO much content in this game, to the point where its mind blowing to be honest.. I don't think there's many games out there that can compete with Cyberpunk in terms of just the sheer amount of content! 

As I said this was a slow burner for me, and I think the main reason for this was the characters and voice acting. I just didn't feel invested in a lot of the characters and found the main character boring as heck, but I decided to stick with it despite this and once I got to the Phantom Liberty DLC, it was almost like something clicked and I was back in. 

One thing I will say that this game nails, is its atmosphere in Night City.. Honestly there's only a few games that can even compare to Cyberpunk in that department.. Its right up there with RDR2 in terms of immersiveness and realism and that's probably the biggest compliment that I can give it!

Overall I did enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone, although it may not be for everyone. I really hope they decide to do a sequel to this game as I'm with those who say this game is highly underrated. Its clear that a lot of time and effort went into creating this game so it deserves all the praise  that it gets.

In conclusion: If you go into this game expecting it to be this flawless masterpiece from start to finish, then you may be a bit disappointed. But, if you go into it with an open mind, give it some time and just try to enjoy it for what it is, then I do think you'll end up having a great time with this game!",1765798661,5786.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,english,False,"I had heard that the bugs with this game were fixed, but that was not the case for me. Visual glitches where people, objects, and cars clip into each other or suddenly respawn are extremely frequent. Dead bodies are especially glitch-prone, although at least they're sometimes funny. I had one outright freeze requiring a force kill and restart.

The many NPCs roaming the world are very stiff, and their interactions unnatural. This applies to cars driving as well. The world does not feel rich and full of things to find as you explore, it feels hollow. Ultimately it is not immersive and comes off as a mediocre video game, not a living world.

The gameplay is pretty standard fare FPS stuff. Moving around just feels too janky for melee combat to be satisfying, despite their focus on making it a viable strategy. Jumping over things and leaping toward enemies just doesn't work very well. The only interesting thing here is the hacking aspect, which they did do a good job with.

The menus, which you will need to be interacting with all the time, are a pain on controller. They seem to have simply taken the mouse-based menus and done a poor job of adapting them for a controller. Often you'll need to be simply navigating the menu by controlling a virtual mouse pointer with your thumbstick. This was very surprising and disappointing, making good controller-based menus is table stakes for a game this big.

The story is the only interesting thing about this game, but it moves far too slowly. After an awesome intro, it slows to a crawl and gets way more boring, just dangling the promise of something interesting in front of you to keep you going, while drip feeding little hints of what cool thing might be in the future.

Doing sidequests before main is OP, Once you get the hang of it, pretty much everything's OP. Side quests are fully animated and voiced, even with boobies and some cush, so 18+, I guess :) Side activities are reasonably fleshed out, providing at least some call/chat logs for context. ""Living world"" is oversold tho, because approaching any activity/quest from afar you can see everybody just in place and waiting for your arrival to start the act. Could've triggered it on sight at least, but... at least they are not T-posing.

I haven't finished through the story because of so much thing to do.

Bought both the game and DLC at sale, and it feels like it's not a complete game without it.

World building is amazing, night city is what i imagine the dystopian future looks like.
Story is heavy, top quality voice acting, and i love that it include real actors (HEll yeah JOHN WICK).
The animation of some of the weapon is chef kiss, and its the stylish fpp/fps game i've ever seen when you can kill enemies with blink of an eye or use time dilation cyberware and be a speed freak :D (or be a walking tank and most chromed out choomba)
Skill building is not that depth but its ok, kinda of like the witcher 3 skill building that rely on perks.
The only thing that i dont like is the lack of NG+, i hope it will be implemented someday so i can play for more when im actually finished the game (with all MY HARD EARNED ITEMS).

Despite all the rough buggy launch that i heard, now that its version 2.31 i only experience a few bugs left (flipping and self driving random cars, fell in the bottom of the map, kerenzikov not activating, opened warehouse but no interior rendered, clipping through building, etc) but its not consistent and only happened at random, so its not very gamebreaking.

I remember that when it first came out, in addition to the high hopes, it also caused disappointment because the compatibility was quite poor and the game had many, many bugs. The latter still occurs sometimes, but I must say they've polished the game up considerably.
It's a huge experience to walk and drive the streets of Night City (the autodrive feature is my favorite in particular, as I can drink my coffee in real life while it runs lol).

Night City is alive. Too alive. Every pedestrian has a full backstory, a trauma, and a reason to walk directly into your car at 200 km/h.

The graphics? Insane. My GPU aged 5 years in 10 minutes. Ray tracing so realistic I could see my own bad life decisions reflected in puddles.

The story hits hard. One minute you’re saving the city, the next you’re questioning free will, capitalism, and why Keanu Reeves lives rent-free in your brain telling you to commit crimes.

Bugs? Sure. Sometimes NPCs T-pose to assert dominance. Cars spawn inside other cars. But honestly… that just makes it more cyberpunk.

Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t just a game.
It’s a beautiful, glitchy, existential crisis simulator where style matters more than morals and everyone needs therapy.

Pros:
+ Good main story and side quests (sometimes)
+ Nice voiceover
+ Huge city with a lot of secrets

Cons:
- Inventory is the same mess as in The Witcher 3, hard to find anything, hard to navigate, no persistent filters, no bulk actions
- Battle gameplay is kinda average, in most cases it's just 2-click combat or plain shooter with not a lot of possibilities
- Game physics behaves super weird sometimes, stuff jumps and explodes when you loot something, bodies of enemies lie on walls or in the air, etc.
- Parkour is also totally random; sometimes a character can parkour, sometimes stops, and can't do anything, and it's not fluent in any way.
- Enemies are super aimy, can easily target me moving behind a wall. Also, sometimes they start spamming with grenades (grenades are so not needed and unnecessary in this game IMO).

1091500,english,True,"This isn't a power fantasy. It's not supposed to make you feel like a badass hero who saves the city. If you went in expecting that, you fundamentally misunderstood what the game is trying to do. CP2077 is a 60+ hour meditation on what it feels like to literally lose yourself in a world that was built to grind you into paste.

**Your body is not your own.**

The first-person perspective isn't just a design choice. It's the entire point. You're locked inside V's skull, and from minute one, that body is a problem you're trying to solve. On one hand, you're installing chrome; turning yourself into a modular meat machine, subject to market logic. You're not ""upgrading."" You're commodifying your own flesh. On the other hand, the Relic is killing you from the inside. Your body is simultaneously a DIY project and a terminal diagnosis. You are, at all times, a dying animal trying to pretend you're a immortal god.

**Night City is not a playground.**

The open world isn't freedom. It's a cage designed to look like freedom. Every icon on that map? That's not content. That's a shift. You're doing gig work. Literally. The game takes the structure of a modern open-world game (all those map markers, all those side hustles) and reveals it for what it actually is: late-capitalist piecework. You are a precarious laborer in a precarious world, and the ""choice"" you have is which fixer to bleed for today. The constant flood of calls, ads, and notifications aren't immersion-breaking; they're the point. You're never alone. You're always being sold to, called on, managed.

And yet you're not alone in another way, too. You meet people. Judy, Panam, Takemura. You form actual connections. You have conversations in dim apartments and on rooftops at dawn. You fall in love, maybe. You find a community. But here's the trap: those connections can't save you. They can't change the structure. The system doesn't care that you have people who love you. The Relic is still killing you. The gigs still come. The city still runs on your body. You're surrounded by genuine human connection in a world built to atomize and consume you, and that makes the alienation worse, not better. You're lonely *and* not lonely at the same time, and neither state offers escape.

**Johnny Silverhand is the ghost of a dead revolution.**

The Relic isn't just a plot device. It's a hostile takeover of your consciousness by a failed radical. Johnny represents every angry kid who thought you could burn it all down and start over. He tried. He lost. And now he's a tumor in your brain, forcing you to reckon with the fact that all the old ways of fighting back are dead. He's the political unconscious of the setting; the corpse of 20th-century rebellion haunting a 21st-century graveyard. The conflict between V and Johnny isn't a buddy comedy. It's two incompatible ideologies fighting a war on the battlefield of a single, dying brain.

**""Becoming a legend"" means destroying yourself.**

The game keeps telling you to become a legend of Night City, and everyone acts like that's the goal. But look at what that actually means. Johnny's a legend. He's dead, and he lost. David Martinez from Edgerunners? Legend. Dead. Legends in Night City aren't people who won. They're people who burned so bright they couldn't be ignored on their way out. The game is offering you a choice between surviving as a nobody or dying as somebody. And here's the kicker: the survival endings feel hollow. The ""good"" endings are the ones where you go out swinging. This isn't about accumulation or victory. It's about sovereign self-destruction; choosing the terms of your own end in a world that wants to choose them for you.

**The combat system is a lie you tell yourself.**

And here's where it gets really interesting. The gameplay loop lets you become an absolute monster. Sandevistan time-dilation, gorilla arms, mantis blades, reflex tuning; you can build V into a one-person apocalypse. The combat feels incredible. You feel unstoppable. And that is the *point* of the dissonance.

The game lets you feel like a god in a body that's rotting from the inside. Every upgrade, every perk, every piece of chrome makes you better at solving problems that don't matter. You're getting stronger in a system that's already killed you. It's the perfect mirror of consumer culture: here, have this power, this product, this upgrade. Ignore that it changes nothing about the structure that's killing you. The progression system is a coping mechanism. You're playing a power fantasy inside a tragedy, and the tragedy wins.

But then, and this is crucial, the game lets you *use* that power for something that matters. The ""blaze of glory"" ending is where all that mechanical mastery finally means something. You've spent 60 hours building the perfect killing machine, and now you get to spend it all on one last, doomed, beautiful act of defiance. The gameplay power isn't there to let you win. It's there so you can choose *how* you lose. That's what makes it a legend. Not that you survived. That you got to decide what your death looked like.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not here to make you feel good. It's here to make you feel *something*; specifically, what it's like to be a person in a world that has mechanized, monetized, and moduleized every aspect of existence, including your own body and mind. It's a game about trying to find meaning in a system designed to extract value and then discard you.",1765689307,206.0,True,False,False,2,0,0.519999980926513672

1091500,english,True,"This game is incredible. I got it on sale for just over 20 dollars and I'm glad that I waited a few years to pick it up because the stability of the game is basically perfect. I've only noticed about 3-4 collision/AI glitches in the 30 hours that I've played so far and none of them interfered with progress on the story.
Pros: 
Highly customizable character builds
Wide variety of weapons and consumables
Every attribute shines at some point during gameplay
All of the side missions that you could think of
strong mod support
Cons:
Some dialogue options feel redundant and many 'choices' won't affect story
cybernetic upgrades don't affect appearance. I want to be MADE OF CHROME GODDAMMIT
all of the side missions fill up your journal and it becomes overwhelming to keep track of all of them
keyboard controls are a bit odd and may need adjusting

I saw I saw corps strip farmers of water ... and eventually of land. Saw them transform Night City into a machine fueled by people's crushed spirits, broken dreams and emptied pockets. Corps've long controlled our lives, taken lots... and now they're after our souls! V, I've declared war not because capitalism's a thorn in my side or outta nostalgia for an America gone by. This war's a people's war against a system that's spiralled outta our control. It's a war against the fuckin' forces of entropy, understand? Do whatever it takes to stop 'em, defeat 'em, gut 'em. If I gotta kill, I'll kill. If I need your body, I'll fuckin' take it! Fuckin' hell ... You still don't see it. But you will one day

Empty wallets and im fucking starved
Empty pockets and im fucking goin hard
Empty wallets and im doin 100 in a track car
Empty pockets and im still working hard

Blazing off fumes
But everyday i still go hard
Runnin off fumes but im standin after
Every fucking fall

Takin shit from the broke thinkin that they worth more
Just a title to a job

Cut em open
Lets see
The color they
Bleed
Raw

Crack em in the jaw
Bills ain't covered by that job
Send em off in a siren
And now they worth a part of a car

Empty wallets and im fucking starved
Empty pockets and i still go far
Still i say fuck the law, fuck the job
Fuck the rich that live to rob
Fuck the weak that cower instead of mob
Fuck the week

Same fucking job

Empty pockets and im fucking goin hard
Empty wallets and im doin 100 in a track car

Slave to a game
Rather break than play some
Fuckin odds
When a fucked system fails i hit restart
When the odds are against I stand tall
When i face thousands i stand strong
When i know im one i know i got the power of gods
When imma righteous, motherfucker
I know that right always beats wrong
Where lies lived long the truth will kill the wrong

- It's like GTA in the near alternate future.
- The level of immersion pushes forward the open world RPG genre. 
- Action was great, many ways to get things done leaving this game have an incredible amount of content in a single release, and the work continues with the expansions, fan mods, etc.
- Visuals are great, not much else to say these days for that. If on PC there's a lot of flexibility as you get up the hardware scale.
- This review is after 2.3, I played the update before and thought it was great too. 
- The story was enjoyable but went by too quickly! Or I wish it was longer, your choice. To new players interested I'd say if you want a really good experience you could spread out finishing all of the main missions and secondary missions.

Now, don't get decieved by Steam saying, I'd only have 5 hours in this game, because I don't. I've been playing this game since Version 1.1, if not 1.0, and finished the entire game, including the DLC. In total, I have around 100 hours, most of that on GOG.

But to my opinion on the game. Do I enjoy it? Yes, I do. Is it amazing, has barely any bugs now and runs great? Absolutely not.

It's a good game. It's unique, does things no other game does and I enjoy it because of that. It's far from amazing, though, and still doesn't even remotely live up to the promises CDPR made before release. But it doesn't need to, it's fine as it is. You can do stupid builds (I built a nearly invincable V, that does way more damage than he should) and I love it for that. It has a ton of completely useless, yet very interesting features, which I'm really a fan of.

It does have a ton of bugs. Some funny, like cars randomly exploding, losing all doors and wheels or NPCs casually walking over things they shouldn't be able to walk over (like cars or walls), but some are really annoying or even game breaking. I'm pretty sure there's also a memory leak somewhere in there, which I ran into a few days ago. Additionally, the game has a few issues with the AMD GPU driver ever since CDPR released the 2.3 update, leading to a ton of micro stuttering and issues with path tracing. That's annoying as heck, and if you enable path tracing even game breaking. What doesn't help is, that the FSR 3 implementation is probably the worst out of any game. It's horrible. FSR 2 is fine (FSR 2 is just old), but FSR 3 is not. So on a Steam Deck, if FSR 2 is too low quality for you, then I'd recommend getting Decky and installing Optiscaler through that, making it possible to use the leaked (by AMD themselves) version of FSR 4. And weirdly enough, on my PC, I feel like the game had less issues on version 1.1 than since 2.0. Despite my PC getting a lot more powerful and the game getting a lot of updates since then. Or perhaps the game has more issues on more powerful PCs?

The performance is... Fine. It's not bad, especially on lower end hardware (like the Steam Deck) the game runs actually surprisingly well, but on higher end hardware the game seems to not scale as well as I would expect. The DLC also has some performance issues, meaning it will struggle on lower end devices, like the Steam Deck and the Switch 2, even though the main game runs fine.

I really hope, that Cyberpunk 2077 2 (or whatever they'll call it) will have less bugs and better performance. And that they'll bring AMD FSR Redstone to both this game and it's sequel.",1765647349,300.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,english,True,"I first played Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5. I came back again. And now here I am on PC for my third playthrough, willingly returning to Night City like it didn’t already ruin me emotionally twice.

Cyberpunk’s comeback story is real. What was once rough around the edges is now one of the most immersive RPG experiences you can play. The world is dense, atmospheric, and dripping with style — Night City isn’t just a map, it’s a place that pulls you in and refuses to let go.

The storytelling is where the game truly shines. Characters feel human, flawed, and painfully memorable. You don’t just complete quests — you get invested in them. Some side missions hit harder than main storylines in other games, and Johnny Silverhand remains one of the best “problematic roommates” in gaming history.

Combat feels tight and flexible, especially on PC. Whether you’re going full netrunner, guns-blazing merc, or stealthy cyber-assassin, the systems finally work together the way they always should have. Driving feels better, movement feels smoother, and everything just clicks now.

Visually, Cyberpunk 2077 on PC is unreal. Neon reflections, rain-soaked streets, detailed interiors — it’s one of those games where you stop mid-mission just to look around. The soundtrack is elite too, perfectly matching the tone whether you’re cruising the city or spiraling into existential dread.

Final verdict:
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A redemption arc done right.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game, and does many world building aspects better than I have ever seen in any other game. The city and its citizens, in particular, are a level of immersive I have never seen before. Truly well done. However, narratively, the devs have clearly decided on the favored ending and make it incredibly apparent to the player how wrong they are if they don't choose it. They have also left in both silly and game breaking bugs that are incredibly easy to catch, with even Bethesda doing better in some aspects.

-CD Projekt Red have really managed to breathe a new level of life into the city environment that I have never seen before. I strongly recommend ignoring getting a car until after you leave the first area. It really is impressive and immersive when walking around.

-They have done a good job in making the permanent companion character grow on you over time. Their attitude progression towards V, the player character, appears natural, and I went from disliking them to caring about them at the end of the game.

-Much of the main story and side quests are well designed. Even the equivalent of fetch and radiant quests manage to have a level of variety not seen from other developers. It was quite enjoyable playing through them.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-The devs are not truly offering the player a choice in how V, the player character, views the world. Having played through all the endings, it is extremely clear that only the companion NPC vendetta choice is truly supported by the devs. They have made it so that any other endings V takes result in him being either neutral or hyper critical of the results, even when the outcomes are almost entirely as desired. This also applies to the DLC endings.

-The friendship/ intimacy paths were not done well in this game. One NPC's path is clearly more fleshed out and based in actual relational development norms, but almost all require suspension of disbelief in how they progress. It was extremely jarring in one path that was at a ""we (literally) met yesterday to do a gig together (the friendship NPC being forced to participate) and succeeded and are relaxing/ light celebrating while waiting"" to suddenly ""hey, I wanna be close and touch you.""

-The devs are also providing unrealistic amounts of support to Bethesda's past position that large open world games are inherently buggy. It becomes obvious how bad the situation is when your character surviving an encounter depends on the game mechanics actually working, being most apparent in an ending called (no spoilers unless you search for details on Google yourself) ""(Don't) Fear the Reaper"". In it, you realize how unacceptably broken and unreliable the detailed mechanics are. It is clear that the devs could (and I would argue, should) have spent time resolving this issue.

-There are bugs in many of the endings, with some being potentially game breaking. An example is one involving an NPC driving the player to a destination (no other choice here). In this ending, the NPC pathing can be utterly broken merely by the NPC driving mechanics the devs have built into the game. I realized this once the NPC took me to Pacifica when I was supposed to be taken to North Oak (opposite ends of the map).

-They have bugs even Bethesda has resolved years ago, such as objects freaking out when you turn away from them. Turning back will show them launching into walls, the ground, and the sky.

[b]The Annoying:[/b]
-Why make the vehicle speed so obviously wrong, CD Projekt Red? It is incredibly noticeable how wrong it is. Just divide all the numbers by roughly 2 and be done with it. This complaint only matters because so many other ""realistic"" aspect are well polished enough that it jarringly stands out.",1765591547,10961.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

havent bought the dlc yet, probably will soon, but i can tell that this game has a lot of replayability (for the skill trees (i wasted my reset lol) and choices). overall just in love with this game. although i am a little upset that i have to buy the dlc to finish the achievements (i am a bit of an achievement hunter) 

This game is essentially all-in-one. prefer story games? it's got story and rpg/ make your own choice elements similar to games like mass effect. play games for the action/gameplay? there are so many different play-styles available and so much to customise to your liking. 

i will admit that this game can feel a little tedious at times (even coming from someone who can replay almost any game countless times) but those are easily countered by the highs that this game has. really makes you feel like you are a part of nigt city. just writing this review cause i can though, there's nothing a youtube video cant show better.

1091500,english,True,"I have so much to say about this game.

This writing is excellent, and it gets even better in Phantom Liberty. A beautiful story with well written, charismatic characters. The city feels alive, very well-designed and (often) beautiful to see. The gameplay and gunplay are fun, also thanks to the pumping soundtrack during fighting sequences, which is very good.

However, I do have to say that there was a lot of misleading/pumped-up marketing leading to the release of this game. It has been promoted as if it was going to be this extraordinary, game-changer RPG game, but the game didn't end up being any of that.

One of the things I found mostly jarring, is that the main story felt disappointingly short. When I saw the ""point of no return"" pop-up show, I had a funny facial expression because I really did not think I was nearly close to the end of the main story. I really feel like a lot of the game content should've been part of the main story. At least the Rogue, Panam and Judy arcs.

Even after 5 years from its release and multiple game patches, I experienced a lot of technical bugs, many of which really worsened the enjoyment and immersion of the game. One of them is Claire driving through the whole city and going crazy at the end of the first The Beast in Me mission when choosing to get back to the garage with Claire. I encountered other game and quest-breaking bugs like this.

Cyberpsychos appear on the game map at all times — this means V technically already knows where each one of them is located. This doesn't make much sense. If there were really 17 cyberpsychos in the city all at once free for days, I think the city would've already been burned to the ground. Would've been much better if Regina simply called her whenever she was close to a cyberpsycho. If V went away instead of defeating it, Regina would call V disappointed and angry since her research would be negatively impacted. The way the mission has been implemented in the game just feels faulty.

Characters are allowed to call you during missions, which can be very bothersome and can disrupt conversations, cause confusion and not being able to listen to mission conversations.

Interactions with Panam when the player is Female V can get very sappy, which feels very unfitting and weird since Panam is straight. I understand that there's a thin line between just looking at two big friends and two friends who look like they're into each other — but it clearly goes over it, and it feels like we're just living the exact same Panam you'd experience with Male V, except there's no kissing or sex scene.

UI is nice, but some of the beta concepts objectively looked better.

The game shows a ""Skip"" prompt on the bottom right when having conversations with characters. You can disable this from the main menu in the Interface section, and I've had it disabled since the first 10 minutes of the game, but it appears that the prompt still shows up in a couple of situations (I've seen it pop up when talking to Lizzy Wizzy for the first time).

The first hour of Phantom Liberty seemed incredibly unstable. Arriving at the Dogtown border - flatline. A few minutes into Dogtown — Flatline. Middle of fighting the Chimera - flatline. I've gotten more crashes in one single hour than I had in my entire playthrough.

I've played the game in Italian and the work that has been done on the localization is simply superb. Probably THE best localization work that has ever been done on a videogame, up there with The Last of Us games. I've listened to other voice over languages such as English, German, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese, and it really seems like CDPR invested a lot into localization in other languages, which is something awesome. Being able to experience the story, the characters, and being able to listen to all sorts of NPC conversations in my native language truly enhanced the immersion of the game for me. Everything has been localized meticulously, with attention to detail, and every small interaction feels natural.

The facial animations with JALI technology help the immersion and voice over even more, with naturally moving lips based on the dialogue audio. However, I have to say that, more often than not, facial animations would have this sudden switch to a different expression in 1 frame, with no interpolation, which feels very jarring.

Overall, I cannot say that I don't recommend this game. The technical bugs can be very frustrating, but other than that, there's a beautiful game. It's clear that a lot of love has been put into it. The story, the characters, how alive and living the city feels, a lot of things are very well-built in this game.

1091500,english,True,"[h1]First Impressions[/h1]
I wasn’t sure about Cyberpunk 33 at first. I tested it through other means before buying it, played about 30 hours on one save, dropped it, then came back later and did another 40 hours on a new run. After all that, I finally bought the full Ultimate Edition. Now I’m 40+ hours into the legit version and basically addicted.

I doubted the game early on, but the more I played, the more it hit me how good it actually is.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]World and Atmosphere[/h1]
The world is insanely well-built. It feels alive in a way most games don’t even get close to. Night City actually has weight, personality, and emotion behind it.

Whenever “I Really Want to Stay At Your House” comes on the radio, it just hits straight in the chest. The game nails the vibe. The city feels full and alive. It’s the kind of world you just exist in, not rush through.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Combat and Gameplay[/h1]
Combat feels solid. Guns, movement, abilities – everything clicks. It’s fast, responsive, and actually fun to experiment with.

Driving is way better than I expected. Vehicles feel grounded now instead of stiff or floaty, and cruising through the city at night is honestly one of my favorite things about the game.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story is on another level. The writing, the characters, the emotional punches – I’m almost done with the main story again and on the DLC path now, and it still hits just as hard as the first time.
They wrote something real here. It sticks.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]From Disaster to Greatness[/h1]
Yeah, everyone knows the game had a brutal launch. But they fixed it. Completely. The devs turned it into something genuinely great. It went from a joke to one of the best RPG experiences in years.

They rebuilt this thing into a monster of a game. Respect where it’s due.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Cyberpunk 33 is worth buying, worth playing, and worth finishing. The world, the story, the atmosphere – everything just comes together. I can recommend it easily to anyone who wants a powerful story in a world that actually feels alive.

1091500,english,True,I waited for this game to come out for years. At first it was rough.... unpolished. I decided to let them work on it and I would come back. Well I did that and a couple years later I am not disappointed. They have done a fantastic job! I am completely immersed in the game. There are some good sex scenes but I wish there was more interaction with your romance partner. I do like that you can hang out and you actually interact like you are a couple but I'd like to be able to get down on the spot if I want and it be INTERACTIVE ( I hope CD Project Red sees this ). I say go all the way or not at all on that subject. Overall though I am very happy with this game and recommend it. Panam is my girl and she is Hot and fun ;).

1091500,english,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 2.31 is like slapping a Band-Aid on a glitching robot dog and telling it to go fetch a grenade launcher—but somehow it works better now. Night City still feels like the lovechild of Blade Runner and a malfunctioning toaster, but at least your car won’t get stuck at red lights anymore (unless it’s being dramatic), because AutoDrive finally learned the difference between “stop” and “GOOOO.” 
SteamDB

Thanks to this update, your ride will now overtake traffic, ignore semantically annoying signals, and generally behave like your ex who never respected boundaries—minus the emotional trauma. 
Bo3

Photographers will rejoice that Photo Mode is less hostile now. NPC collision is disabled (translation: you can smash granny into a car hood and finally get that avant-garde shot for Instagram), and pretty much all poses now work for everyone. 
SteamDB

Plot holes? Mostly fixed. Quest bugs that once made your game laugh and crash are now politely ignored. It’s basically Night City saying: “Look, we still hate your saves, but we’ve learned to behave… some of the time.” 
SteamDB

And yes, you can finally turn off that obnoxious vignette effect that made you feel like you were constantly staring out of someone’s eyeballs. 
Reddit

But let’s be honest: Cyberpunk’s real personality is its bugs. If a cyber-waifu doesn’t spontaneously bail for Mars or your car doesn’t do a spontaneous barrel roll in traffic at least once per session, did you even play? (Answer: yes––but you’re doing it wrong.)

In short, Patch 2.31 feels like the game waking up with coffee and deodorant: slightly more polite, marginally less suicidal, still absolutely chaotic. Night City won’t change—but it might stop trying to murder your vehicle.",1765496214,7919.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.497084558010101318

Combat is divided into conventional gunplay, which is fine; melee combat, which is weightless and uninteresting; and quickhacks, which are useless for 50% of the game and blatantly overpowered and boring for the other 50%. 

The world has nothing to do but engage in repetitive combat encounters, side quests and main story missions are all variations of combat and stealth encounters with no interesting mix-ups to the gameplay. The writing feels like the first draft of a 9th grade edgelord's fanfiction, and all of the characters so painfully dull it actually became a chore to suffer through their cutscenes.

The sound of the same 20 ads cycling round and round has given me mild ptsd. If you loot a building for 10 minutes or more.. with a tv in it! You'll want to just leave the loot behind.

There is a possibility that there is a perk that makes them automatic or skip the actual hacking sequence.... not sure, but it wasn't the skill tree I built, which is making for a miserable experience after 250 hours.

One of the most worthwhile games to play, not only because of its diverse gameplay with many character customization options, but also because of the music that evokes a certain feeling in the player, especially the song ""I really want to stay at your house."" The NPCs in the game interact with the player in a way that's not typical of other games. The Phantom Liberty DLC expansion clearly shows the difference between Night City and Dogtown. Some parts of the Edgerunner movie are also recreated in the game, such as ""David's Jacket"" and ""Guts, Rebecca Shotgun."" These are items you can obtain in the game thanks to scenes from the movie, which makes the characters even more important. Furthermore, the game's six endings offer players a multi-layered emotional experience.

1091500,english,True,"I never thought I'd play this game. I remember when it came out and it was a laggy, buggy mess. But, time passed, five years passed, and the game was 65% off. I decided to give it a try.

I ended up enjoying it a lot.

The story follows V, a mercenary for hire in Night City (essentially a futuristic Los Angeles). Your character's background (Nomad, Street Kid, Corpo) influences the start of the story and gives some dialogue options. I chose Nomad, the other two seemed kind of generic. From there, you are given story missions to complete and optional gigs from fixers (quest-givers), and other side jobs. The story at first is just okay. The biggest problem is it goes all over the place. There are so many story missions that left me scratching my head, not sure why I was doing this, and sometimes outright bored. Things get a lot more interesting in the 2nd and 3rd acts of the game. There is some overlap with the story of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i], which surprised me It gets pretty depressing from that point, there aren't real happy endings in this game. It reminds me a bit of  I also bought the ""Phantom Liberty"" DLC, which adds onto the base game. It also gets pretty depressing  The story in that is compelling and is a lot easier to follow. I recommend buying it if you care about story in games. It adds several new missions too which is nice.

Your stats points affect how you approach missions, of which there are many. Many are your standard ""kill x"" and ""retrieve _"" but there is a lot more than that, I was surprised by the variety. I decided to pour my points into body (health), tech ability (cybernetics and armor), and reflexes (blades). There is also a skill tree connected to each ability, granting unique powers. I unlocked the ability to finish, instantly kill, low HP enemies with my blades, granting a temporary movement boost, deflect enemy bullets with my katanas, leap at enemies, and dash through midair. I also invested in cybernetics to increase my defense, HP, and crit chance. In the end I ended up being a cyber shinobi tank, 600 HP, taking bullets like they were rubber, and slicing through enemies like butter. This was very fun to say the least. There are other options available, you can specialize in blunt weapons like clubs, and hacking or stealth. The latter I didn't do because I'm too impatient. There are many other gameplay features, too many to name, like racing, hiring a prostitute, and romancing characters. There are two romance options per gender, a gay and a straight option. The gay characters hint at their sexuality in dialogue, but only barely, which is pretty annoying. I ended up romancing Kerry, who decided not to leave Night City with V, because his music career was more important. Fuck him for that. He's dead to me.

My main problems with this game, besides the story being weak at times, is the games' performance. Every time I would go to the map to track a fast travel point and a mission, I would get a massive lag spike for several seconds. The game also crashed and froze several times. After I completed the game, it asked about returning to a previous save with something special waiting for me. I said yes and then it crashed. That felt supremely ironic. This could be a problem with my PC but it runs  [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] without issues, so I'm not sure. Sometimes missions also didn't spawn, and I had to reload a previous save, which was annoying. If you have a lower end device, then you're likely to run into problems. I also wished romances had a bigger effect on the story, after you romance a character they'll sometimes message you about coming to your place, where you have a date night. V went on a date with Kerry every time he asked and he still wouldn't leave the city with him, so again fuck him.

[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is no master piece, but it's come a long way since it's release, and is a really good game. If anything I mentioned sounds interesting, I recommend buying the game. Just keep the caveats about the story and game performance in mind.

1091500,english,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an great game. The city is diverse and feels real. The characters and organizations in the game are realistic and all are likeable in their own way. Driving cars, shooting, and running around all feel good and are very fun to just do without a purpose.

The story is great too. It has it's moments, some more memorable than others, but the characters and plot are all very cool and immersive. The twists and emotional moments are all touching and will stick with you.

But the game has some bugs. Most bugs that still exist aren't very bad, but they are noticeable and take you out of it sometimes. Like when the bartender at the Afterlife pours a drink, and the drink floats in the air rather than staying in her hand. To me it's not a dealbreaker, but bugs like that shouldn't be there after five years of being out.

Cyberpunk 2077's performance is notoriously bad. It's basically the new Crysis. On my 7900xtx and 9800x3d I played at 4k medium settings and I think it hovered around 70-80 FPS. This is without graphics mods or performance mods.

The draw distance in this game can't be changed. And it's a problem. Building details, street marks, foliage, rocks, all of that kind of detail noticeable pops in and out as you drive. Sometimes it's not so bad, but when you notice it, you really notice it.

Overall the game is great. It has some graphics hiccups but I think the story and gameplay make up for it. Maybe getting it on sale would be best since it's an older game and has some unfixed problems though.",1765421734,3542.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1091500,english,True,"a game so good i can't bring myself to end the playthrough. i am too attached. 

for its faults there is nothing like it. no piece of video game media has ever made me feel the way cyberpunk has: nothing has made me think like it does about life, about friendships, about an innumerable (at least for the purposes of this short text) amount of abstract social and philosophical ideas. every part of night city is festering and screaming to be ripped from the roots but this (due to my fault) awkwardly-phrased proverbial tree has grown to be a whole city which is all that's holding up these poor million of souls. what are you but an insect in the bark? the world doesn't care or do anything for you, in fact it hates you for having needs, you are at best beneficial in a symbiotic sense to it with your continuing capability to consume. the game teaches you human life here is worth nothing- but instead of leaving it there utterly nihilistically like a lot of stories do, it shows you the importance of personal relationships and friendship and discovering the inherent worth of others and yourself, no matter how fucked and complicated it all is we're still capable of the same base contact and that cannot be taken away so easily, which i thought was beautiful. there is NO winning and you should STOP trying to win, there are things around you worth living for but any attempt to go on an upward trajectory will forever be on a greased incline. every story you come across is shaking you violently to stop kidding yourself.

all in all what terrific science fiction it is. i think the best in the genre that's been made on the medium so far.
shooting people is pretty fun too.

please, if you are buying this and starting a first playthrough, trust me and choose the corpo-lifepath. it gives you the most emotional stake in all of the story, especially in the first and third acts. female V's acting comes off a bit easier to interpret in the way you'd like -- no hate intended to male V's actor, he also does a fantastic job but I felt as if some of his line delivery had more of a preconceived harder set feeling superimposed on it in comparison with female V's who's less angularly pointed(?) delivery felt easier to project my own reading onto, though I may also just be relating to woman protagonists more in general. 

avoid spoilers, take your time in conversation and zero plenty gonks :--)) i maxed out my dash, got my double jump and zipped across roofs, over heads and cars and through the air blasting everyones face off with a shotgun as they all spun around too late to get a shot in. good fucking fun!

PS another reason i haven't finished my playthrough is because the endings are all a bit shit (could be worse though, just unsatisfying!) but you don't need to worry about that yet <33",1765419378,7224.0,True,False,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666
1091500,english,True,"Wow! It's been 5 whole years since this game came out. I've beat this game many times and have since started playing with mods (296 mods are active on my game) and I still can't get enough. I hop to other games, join friends, try out new ones, but I always come back to Cyberpunk 2077. There are always new things that I haven't done in my previous hundreds of hours in the game that I somehow missed. I'll probably be playing this game in 2077 when I'm 85 years old. 

If somehow you haven't played Cyberpunk in the 5 years it's been out, do yourself a favor and buy it (It's currently on sale for $20.99. what do you have to lose?)

The Cyberpunk world became something truly important for me, even with all the bugs, even if it couldn't make me cry, but this game became such an important piece of my life.

I played almost daily and that's the reason i regret going to the Embers.

I felt like there is still time, one more gig here, another mission there and that is still will be time to finish the game, but i rushed it — went to the Hanako and finished the main story. And after the ending, even when i'm back to the NC — it's no longer the same city.

1245620,english,False,"I will never understand the Souls-like genre. Everybody seems to love it. I get recommended these games multiple times a year and yet every time I try one, it feels like the same experience all over again.

When Dark Souls 1 and 2 were still a novelty I actually UNDERSTOOD the appeal. “The point is that it doesn’t handhold you” great. That made sense at the time. But this genre has been run into the ground. Over and over it’s the same setting, the same tone, the same ""mythic past"" or ""bleak dark future"" where the bloodied, tarnished, vanquished whatever must fight Eli the All-Mighty Executioner to prove their worth. It’s creatively stagnant.

What really loses me is the design philosophy. What skill is actually being tested when you’re ambushed constantly, die, respawn and then simply remember where the traps are? That isn’t ""skill"" it’s memorisation. By that logic Far Cry 3 is a Souls-like because you die once, then know where the pirates are next time and sneak up on them. Maybe I just don't GET it.

The genre is also an oxymoron. Souls-likes are constantly framed as niche, hardcore experiences, yet they are massively popular. They sell millions, dominate charts and dozens of them release every MONTH. That isn’t niche. The appeal often seems less about fun or creativity and more about being able to say “I did it or something.”

I’m not here to trash THIS specific game. Elden Ring is clearly well-made and crafted by the original architects of the genre. But Souls-like games have been mythologised to such an extreme degree that they can never realistically deliver what people claim they do. They don’t meaningfully prove skill, they don’t offer an especially interesting challenge and for me, they’re rarely fun.

It’s just not my cup of tea. I'll keep it in my library to play on rainy days.

1245620,english,True,"Ah.. Elden Ring. Seni incelemek, İstanbul’a benziyor. Biraz tatlı, biraz acı. Biraz emin, biraz değil. Üzümlü kekim mi diyeyim, kabusum mu? Karar vermem güç.

Evet, üstte belirttiğim gibi. Zor, bir o kadar da güzel bir oyun. Yoran, bir o kadar da haz veren bir oyun. İstanbul misali. 

Elden ring her şeyden önce muazzam dövüş mekanikleri olan, mükemmel atmosferi bulunan, zorlayıcı, etkileyici bir oyun diyerek başlamak isterim. Gaming dünyasının olmazsa olmazı gibi bir oyun bu. Soulslike’ı sevdirecek boyutlarda başarılı. Fakat öyle bir sıkıntısı var ki, siz sormayın ben söylemeyeyim. 

Oyunda bir mod kurulumu yardımıyla duo oynayabiliyorsunuz. Fakat bunun bir dezavantajı olacak. Eğer duo’ysanız, sürekli oyun dünyanızın raid yemesine hazır olun. Bu raidler o kadar saçma, o kadar aptalca ki, tüm oyunun güzelliğini gölgeliyor adeta. 

Anlamlandıramadığım bir şekilde pvpsi her daim laglı. 10000 megabit internete de sahip olsan, vuruşlar hep laglı bir şekilde rakibe gidiyor. Vurduğun halde canını azaltamıyorsun. İşin PvP kısmında dodge sisteminde sıkıntı var. 

Daha da garibi, bu raid esnasında gerçekleşen PvP düellosunun, hiçbir şekilde adil olmayışı. Gelen kişi itemsel ve level olarak sizden çok da güçlü oluyor. Bundan da saçması, siz bir boss fight’ının ortasında raid yiyorsunuz ve eksik pot’la oynamanız gerekiyor. Sırf bu sebeple oyuna dislike atasım var, ama bunu yapmadım. Çünkü bu, haksızlık ve duygularımla hareket ederek yaptığım bir puanlama olurdu.

Alınız efendim. İndirimde kaçırmayınız bu oyunu. Alıp da bir gün oynarım bea diyerek de almayınız. Hemen indirip başlayınız. Pişman olacağınızı sanmıyorum.

I play it on a laptop not meant for gaming and so there was the added difficulty of a pretty bad pc port which has very slow input lag and control drift, in addition to stuttering and whatnot, but enemies and bosses are mostly doable as long as they are predictable. Once I got a controller, everything became much easier due to more responsive controls and whatnot, even on this potato laptop.

Some critiques:
1. Some of the level and arena designs are quite poor in that they present difficulties unrelated to the game mechanics but are purely technical such as giant bosses in tiny arenas which lead to cameras constantly clipping into the walls and the boss itself
2. These poor design issues combine with poor controls to create situations where you are really fighting against your own PC and camera rather than the boss itself, which can be a challenge in itself but not the enjoyable point of this game.

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring is likely one of, if not, the best games I've ever played. The spectacle, the feeling of victory - the grandiose of it all truly feels like a once in a lifetime experience. I fear I will never play a game as marvelous as ELDEN RING.

Elden Ring is a beautiful, yet cruel game that rewards persistence and grit; the stunning world you enter is violent, unforgiving, and harsh... Yet the player persists. The sense of accomplishment that comes when you finally conquer a challenge you'd been stuck on, or finally clear a dungeon/castle is something I've never experienced in a game before. 

Elden Ring is the definition of a legendary journey. You will face overbearing hardship across the wide, open world that is The Lands Between, with each of its distinct regions posing different challenges.

In Caelid, you'll be challenged by vast amounts of dragons and putrid, rotten creatures. Liurnia of the Lakes will have you battling mages and spirits, while the Mountaintops face you with snowy trolls and giant crows. Each region is distinctly difficult - and the vastness of the open world poses a new challenge at every turn.

The vastness of The Lands Between is complimented greatly by the diverse array of challenges presented all throughout. In each crevice, you'll find catacombs to conquer, a hidden boss, or an NPC you've never seen. The world of Elden Ring is full of things to see - each testing your persistence and skill.

Elden Ring is without a doubt, a MASTERPIECE - not because it is forgiving, but precisely the opposite. Elden Ring is a test of determination and persistence; completion is proof of struggle - and I love a good challenge.",1766413297,12111.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I liked Sekiro and Bloodborne and to a lesser extent DS1, 2 and 3, but I just found this to be dragged out way too much, be way to focused on making specific builds and so much essential stuff being hid around the massive world. It was just too much and not explained in any way. 

Often losing track of what you were supposed to do when sidetracked by some dungeon, and often you find yourself in areas that you are way underleveled for. Last part was especially aggregios to me, because the game felt more like a mmorpg grind rather than a souls-experience. Also, a ton of essential stuff is hidden in dungeons or other maps that are theoretically ""optional"".

At the end, I just wanted the game to be over so I could call it a day and not feel like I wasted my money, but that is more on me and my stubbornness I guess. Felt relief to be done with the bosses more so than accomplishment like I did with other entries. Especially because some had cutscenes you had to skip every time, some had annoying walk-backs, and others had annoying, tedious first phases. 

I understand why people like it. But I personally found it way too much, given the typical amount of repetition you need to do in order to progress a boss.

1245620,english,True,"I love this game so much in so many ways, but at times it's a very love hate relationship. Going into it, I felt the game was overhyped, and even several hours hours in, I still felt that way and was close to dropping it. Then something clicked, and I can wholeheartedly say that yes, this game does deserve the hype, and I cannot recommend it enough.

This was my first FromSoftware game, and I do not think I will be playing another, not because this one was unenjoyable but just because I'd like to keep this as the standard of soulslike I got to experience, and the open world Elden Ring offers, from my understanding, isn't offered in the other games. In many moments, Elden Ring felt like the perfect game, however it does have its flaws, so I guess it isn't a perfect game? I feel the first playthrough of this game is something that you'll never quite be able to capture the feeling of again, in all the right ways. 

The game’s lore is deep, but its story is not told through a traditional main storyline narrative. Instead, the player needs to put together pieces gathered through NPC dialogue, world exploration (environmental details), and item descriptions. Additionally, there is no quest log, and little guidance on where to go or what to do next. Even after completing my first playthrough, I still did not have a solid understanding of the story, and most of what I know now came from external sources. However, that's not to say I wasn't picking up what the game was putting down. Interestingly, when I replayed the opening cutscene in New Game+, it felt completely new because of how much I had learned during my first playthrough. The more you understand the world, the more rewarding exploration and side content become. However, you are probably not playing Elden Ring for its story, but for its gameplay and challenge. 
In my opinion, the world is the game’s greatest achievement. It is massive, detailed, and genuinely feels alive. The art direction is stunning, with a wide range of distinct regions, and for the first time since games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and CD Projekt RED titles, I felt truly immersed again. There is a constant urge to want to keep exploring and see what the world has to offer.

However, the beauty of the world comes with a steep initial hurdle. The lack of direction makes it easy to spend hours exploring without feeling like you have made any real progress. My first 10 hours were spent wandering aimlessly, and that nearly made me quit. It was only after following guides to understand where to go and how to build my character that the game opened up. Once it did, exploration became far more satisfying, though I still frequently looked things up, from build optimization to hidden bosses. 
The combat and boss fights are what the game is best known for, and overall, they deliver. The game offers strong build variety through weapons, spells, talismans, and skills, and most playstyles are viable. You can also respec your character's skill points later on, which allows for experimentation. While the game is challenging, I do not think it is as punishing as its reputation suggests. Most bosses took me fewer than 10 attempts, and if something felt impossible, there was always the option to explore more, level up, and return stronger. In that sense, the player has some control over the game’s difficulty.

That said, the combat is not without issues. There is a noticeable difficulty spike in certain late game areas where even regular enemies deal excessive damage. Some encounters feel unfair rather than challenging, with stun locking enemies or poorly designed bosses. Many large bosses suffer from awkward hitboxes or fights that revolve around chasing them for extended periods, which is simply not enjoyable. Unfortunately, even the final boss falls into this category. Enemy aggression also became a constant annoyance, with enemies chasing far beyond what feels reasonable. 
Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the base game enough to buy the DLC at full price. Visually, it lives up to the base game’s world design, but the difficulty is noticeably higher, and exploration feels tense rather than rewarding. Many of the combat issues present in the base game are amplified here, and the frustration often outweighed the enjoyment.

The DLC bosses are not difficult in a satisfying or engaging way, but instead feel frustrating and exhausting. Difficulty and challenge do not automatically translate to good boss design or enjoyment. Rather than feeling creative or well-paced, they often rely on constant aggression, excessive attack chains, oversized AOEs, and very limited openings. It felt like Many encounters came down to dodging insanely well only to be rewarded with like two seconds to retaliate, which quickly becomes draining.

To be clear, I beat the main bosses in the DLC and then more, which I feel is important to say given how often criticism is dismissed on the basis of skill. If this style of design works for you, then that is completely valid, but for me, it made many fights feel more annoying than challenging. While the DLC does include one of my favorite bosses in any game I have played, Rellana, the overall boss design direction was disappointing.

I would only recommend the DLC to players who truly loved the base game and want to experience everything it has to offer. If not, I would say skip the DLC, leave it at the base game.",1766276568,6994.0,True,False,False,0,1,0.5
1245620,english,False,"Early game is fun but I'm just not into the world or exploring. I have played a lot of open world games and loved them especially with mods but this is just too open and aimless for a fromsoft game.

Sad to say it, I want to like this game but It's just really dull.

 I wanted to buy DS3 but it wasnt on sale so I bought this instead since everyone rates it so highly. Honestly very very very average experience, I think if you have not played many open world games/RPGs or fromsofts previous titles you'll probably like this but just know this game is not a masterpiece and the people saying that are genuinely clueless as in they have not touched a good RPG in their life hence they see this as ""10/10.""

1245620,english,False,"My review for this game is a mix review i will not be turning on comments i am not here to debate with people that the is good or not or what experience that they had i really don't care about other people's opinions you want to debate with other people about if the game is good or not you make a review about the game and turn on comments and debate with other on your own time. I am only here to tell my own experience with the game to warn or if someone want to buy the game for the first time. 

My experience with the game is ok before the game was on for sale I ended up spending the $80 bucks on the game and it was not worth the money for an early birthday/christmas gift the leveling in the game is very different unless you're a person that has played soul games before the way you level up is weird You level up by in-game currency that is called runes you can get these by killing minions or bosses or side bosses and you don't level up by discovering new areas or completing other npc quests some do give you stuff but not for leveling I even had to look up videos for npc quests because the game does not tell you if you are not done with npc quests and had to spoil the game just to figure out where to go for the next step. As for character you do get to pick characters that has good staring stats but not as good as you would think. To do basic or maximum damage is between 50 or 60 or 80 by the time you do invest in your points for your skill progression the more it will cost you meaning the more that you invest the more it will cost just to level up one skill. As for bosses combat it just feels wonky sometimes when you dodge some of the hits from the bosses still manages get you even though you dodged at the right moment this even goes for side bosses as well. Overall I found this game to be overhyped and no one really wants to go in Pacific details about the game. The game does have New game Plus so if you want to play the storyline again without restarting a whole new character you can and yes you can also play with your friends even if you start a new game plus but my rating for the game is a 3 out of 10 In my eyes it was just too overhyped even for 2025 and going on 2026.

If you think that the game is worth getting on sale to buy that is clearly up to you I cannot really speak for everyone else's experience but my own even then I wish I would have just spent my money on a different game in my opinion",1766258156,11843.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

It's frustrating and I'm saying that in a good way since it's pushing you to learn to dodge better, to manage your flasks better, to approach the boss with different strat etc. It has beautiful areas where the structures and/or the flora looks fantastic, and also PUTRID areas... where there are creepy freaky monsters waiting to ambush you and slice and dice you! It has great map as well, with lots of different areas and each one is unique in its own way!! The bosses are also amazingly designed with each one being very different from other ones. There are no two alike bosses which helps keep the game fresh and fun. The variety of weapons and armor is so much as well which really helps in above said ""different strat"" finding. Respecing your character is also easy so you can switch you playstyle almost whenever you want!

Because I think everyone else reading this, will most likely love this game. You still might be like me and hate it despite your best efforts. I actually wish I hadn't bought it or put so much time into it.

I've logged 60h+ because of a friend of mine who is a huge fan, convinced me to play co-op. So he held my hand and helped me (basically carried me) for the whole adventure.

- While the game is overall showcasing beautiful landscapes and epic scale, I can't get past the ""dated"" look it has in terms of noisiness in detail, the dirty textures, the illogical structures  and somewhat empty flat barren lands of nothing. I can't really get behind the generic look of some of the maidens or some of the un-describable monsters. That isn't to say there aren't pretty areas or characters, but it felt hugely inconsistent to me.
- I didn't feel like I experienced much of a story, or narrative elements beyond a few cutscenes, and obscure dialogues sprinkled across hours of gameplay. I am also the kind of player who needs a journal/quest log of some kind, to understand or remember what I've found, what I'm doing... and how any of that matters.
- The inventory, dialogue prompts, consumable/equipment switching all felt really clunky and badly designed to me. Like why do you'd have to make sure to talk to an NPC 6-8 times in a row to make sure you exhausted all topics with them to receive a reward... the only way to know ?? Another player who did it before...
- I kind of got the idea of the combat where you want to be meticulous and not button spammy... but I swear my weapon went through the enemies more than half of the time, and yet I'd go flying if they so much as looked at me funny.
- Quests and object unlocks and secrets and ridiculous platforming that all seem to be tied to ""you just had to know, be incredibly stubborn/curious or did it by accident by playing this as if you were a game tester"" Spending literally 20 minutes scaling a wall that doesn't look climbable, all to drop down somewhere to pick up one rare item that you wouldn't even know was there....

So....... even after 60h... I didn't like the game. I was not having fun and as much as I wanted to join my friend in his enthusiasm for FromSoftware games... I kept finding more things against it...

Here is my opinion on ELDEN RING.

Pros:

1. The Great Katana, especially with Cold infusion and Chilling Mist
2. The lore
3. The cutscenes (+the voice acting)
4. A few of the bosses like Messmer or Mohg
5. Some of the scenery

Cons:

1. The open world feels useless and way too big.
2. You need to grind materials/runes for everything.
3. Bosses are spammed and copy-pasted across the world, besides they just feel unfair, delaying their attacks too much and being way too fast in their attack outcome.
4. Bosses like Promised Consort or Malenia aren’t hard, they’re just overwhelming in their animations (I can’t see sh*t in that 2nd phase) and the sheer amount of attacks they throw at you.
5. Torrent dies everywhere, anytime. 
6. The camera just sucks, especially in fights with big bosses.
7. Invaders are either other casuals you beat in just a few seconds (20%) or some toxic little sh*theads, who can only win with their skilless twink gear (80%).

1245620,english,True,"Rise, Tarnished… and prepare to die. A lot.

Elden Ring is epic on a grand scale. Ridiculous in the best way possible.

This game feels like David vs. Goliath on drugs — and somehow that makes perfect sense once you’re playing it. Every fight feels stacked against you, every victory feels earned, and every boss defeat is satisfying. Period.

This game is so good.
This game is so beautiful.
This is one of the best open-world games ever made. Period.

Elden Ring is the kind of game where I can finish a playthrough, put it down for months — even a year — and come back like no time has passed. It always pulls you back in because the world, the combat, and the freedom are just that good.

There’s more than one way to play, and none of them feel wrong. Strength builds, magic builds, faith, dex, weird hybrid nonsense — it all works if you commit. The game respects your choices and then immediately tests them.

You will die. A lot.
Sometimes to a boss.
Sometimes to a random enemy you underestimated.
Sometimes because gravity remembered you exist.
And yet, every time you see YOU DIED, you just think, “Alright… one more try.”

Every time you beat a boss, it feels earned. Not handed to you. Not cheap. Earned. Period.

If I had to give a complaint, it’s honestly this:
I wish there were more bosses to fight.

That’s it.

Honestly, I could say so much about this game — the lore, the story, what’s really going on beneath the surface, the characters, the world, all of it. But no matter what I say, it wouldn’t truly do this game justice.

This game is simply that good.
Just play it.

1245620,english,False,"Disclaimer: For most people, I actually would recommend the game. But, for me personally, the more time passes the more flaws I see in the game, and my ultimate opinion on it is that it contains an all-time great game, but also a lot of junk that was never a problem in FromSoft's older titles.

Obviously the visual art is masterful. Obviously the music is some of the best ever to grace a video game. Obviously getting a big stick to beat your enemies' asses with while you roll around like a madman is awesome. Obviously the spectacle and beauty of the environments and bosses are breathtaking. All of these things can also be said about every previous soulsborne game.

Unfortunately, this game also contains a humongous map that is honestly exhausting to explore, and frequently that exploration rewards you with discovering a copy-pasted mine/cave that probably has some loot at the end that you will never use. The huge map also spreads its scant cast of NPCs further out than ever before, taking an obtuse and mysterious NPC quest system present in Dark Souls and stretching it to the point of being literally impossible for me to keep track of. You will run into NPCs that you haven't seen in 10 or 20 hours, and without a guide, how am I possibly supposed to remember what they said to me last time and know how to progress their storylines? It's just, ""Huh, there is that weird guy I met like 2 IRL weeks ago. He looks cool, but what is he even doing again?"" Simply put, the game is too big and too long for me, it just gets tiring and cumbersome, I seriously just wanted it to be over by the time I was 75% of the way through.

I'm also not a fan of a lot of the boss fights. It takes a problem that started in Dark Souls 3 and cranks it up even further, which is the design idea of, ""If we just put a bonfire right outside the boss arena, we can make it a 3-phase clusterjam with movement cancelling and 69 different attacks for the player to memorize, and it won't matter if the player dies 20+ times because they can immediately retry!"" Too me, this is so much less fun than the classic Dark Souls 1/2 challenge of battling your way through a gauntlet of enemies and traps and then fighting a challenging, but not overloaded boss as the cherry on top. It used to feel like a boss fight was your opportunity to prove that you have mastered an area and are ready to move on. In Elden Ring, a lot of boss fights feel like a tacked-on reflex and memorization challenge that is separate from the challenge of the area itself.

While I can appreciate that FromSoft tried going bigger and grander, I ultimately feel like they lost some of the old magic along the way, and Elden Ring ended up being annoying and fatiguing in a way that their previous titles never were for me. What a shame, as this is clearly their biggest hit, so I guess I'm in the minority. I can squint and see a 10/10 life-changing game in it, but ultimately the size and length of the game, some of the ridiculously complex bosses, and the copy-pasted open world elements distract from the solid core and drag the experience down. I can confidently say I won't be replaying this game, unlike Dark Souls 1 and 2, Bloodborne, and Armored Core 6, which all sound very enticing to return to.",1766082668,6316.0,True,False,False,120,5,0.630298495292663574

“What’s that in the distance?” (worst mistake of my life) Elden Ring’s open world is basically a trap. You see something cool far away, ride Torrent towards it, and suddenly you’re fighting a boss you were definitely not supposed to meet yet. And somehow… that’s the fun. No markers screaming at you, no hand-holding — just curiosity, punishment, and eventually triumph.

Git Gud, But Fair. Yes, it’s hard. Yes, you will die. A lot.
But every death feels like your fault. Every boss — from Margit teaching you humility, to Malenia reminding you that she has never known defeat — exists to test your patience, not waste your time. When you finally win, the dopamine hit is unreal.

Elden Ring doesn’t tell you its story. It dares you to discover it.
Godfrey’s exile, Marika’s defiance, Radahn holding back the stars while rotting, Ranni’s long game… the lore is deep, tragic, and beautifully fragmented. If you enjoy piecing together stories from item descriptions at 3 AM, this game will ruin you (in the best way).

Art Direction That Carries the Game The moment the soundtrack swells during a boss fight, you feel it. From Limgrave’s calm despair to Leyndell’s golden decay, the world tells its own story without saying a word.

There were quite alot of things I really enjoyed in this release to be quite frank, and completing this game felt like I had just impregnated 5 women at a beach bar in the Phillipines; Incredibly satisfied and also kind of empty inside. Elden Ring isn't really about the story in my books, or the end goal, it is about the journey and also surprisingly your choices although small do have consequences and weight. I will have to say I do recommend this game. 

When I started it, I dispised the lack of hand holding and still think that they should give you as the player a bit more direction due to the fact I just relied on youtube tutorials to be completely honest. But this game has grown on me since starting it. It definitely felt like a journey, albeit a miserable one that I admitedly just used god mode nearing the end but either way I did kind of enjoy it. 

Do i recommend it at full price? , not really, Also do I think this is the Skyrim killer everyone told me it was? , No it was some kind of strange masochism simulator that felt like it had its plot or lack of it torn out of some crappy anime with some of the hilariously cheesy lines from the bosses.

I'd trade my entire rune collection just to feel that moment again—stepping out of the cave into Limgrave for the first time, seeing the Erdtree pierce the sky in golden light, the magnificent open world of the Lands Between stretching before my mortal eyes, watching that tree sentinel patrol below while the wind whispers ""you're gonna die here, several times.""

You have yet to discover the beautiful, fascinating and rich lore of all the Gods, Demigods, Cosmic Entities, Dragons, Foul Beasts and Pathetic Sorts. Every castle, catacomb, and creepy village tells a story if you're patient enough to read it. The worldbuilding is chef's kiss—cryptic, layered, and haunting. Dog ahead.

The gameplay is buttery smooth once you stop panic rolling. Every victory feels earned. Every defeat teaches you something (usually ""don't get greedy""). Would gladly get destroyed by CHAD MALENIA again, but not that VIRGIN ERDTREE AVATAR.

1245620,english,True,"Completed the game.  Level 168, ~160 hours spent.  Overall a brilliant game, I think perhaps one of the few games in which I’ve spent over 150 hours (perhaps only the second one on steam after cyberpunk 2077).    

Hardest bosses fought (in that order) - 
- Elden beast + radagon 
- General Radahn.  
- Malenia 

Also, ended up clicking on the blue summon sign and got Ranni’s ending lol. At first, it felt so anti-climatic, I mean I fought the elden beast for over a dozen times and then this ending ? But, after reading the lore, I feel this was perhaps one of the best endings.

Pros:
- The game has a brilliant core gameplay loop that pulled me in and kept me engaged through out.
- The art / graphics is truly amazing.  Every region feels different.  The palaces are designed beautifully  and they do feel like grand palaces !
- Some of the NPC’s and their side quests are interesting too.
- The world has a nice lore that kept me glued (just like the prev from soft game - blood borne).  I kept reading the flavor text on every item to understand more.
- The open world is brilliantly crafted with enough checkpoints and stuff to do to not feel frustrated / bored.

Cons:
- As with other from soft games, there’s little explanation of whats going on and very little assistance in terms of quests / where to go next etc.
- Enemy variety is not that great.  Many enemies repeat in stronger versions in the later areas.
- Boss fights are a hit and a miss
- Catacombs / caves have the same environments repeated with similar enemies over and over.  It got really boring towards the end.
- Weapon switching became a headache as you need smithing stones to level up (irrespective of your level/attributes) and in the early-mid game, you cannot really experiment much (until you find the bell bearings).

Might do another play through some day with more points in INT/ARC attributes which I never really got to explore.

Definitely in my top 10 of all time. 9/10 from my end :)",1765986918,9605.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Elden Ring

The Magnum Opus: A Dream Combination of Open World & Souls

🌍 A Match Made in Heaven
First and foremost, this is the game I have always dreamed of. Merging the tension of Souls-game combat with the freedom of a vast Open World was a stroke of genius. The sense of exploration, the scale of the map, and the freedom to go anywhere are simply unmatched. It was pure joy.

⚔️ The Combat: A Love-Hate Relationship
To be honest, I initially hated the boss patterns. From a pure melee perspective, the game relies heavily on unnatural delayed attacks and excessive combos (which I despise). It felt like the developers were trying too hard to catch veterans off-guard.

👻 The Solution: Embrace the ""Spirit Ashes""
However, the Spirit Ash (Summon) system changed everything. At first, I thought using summons was ""cheating."" I was wrong. The game is designed around them. When I accepted the Spirit Ashes as a core tool—just like my weapon or shield—the ""unfair"" bosses became manageable and fun puzzle pieces. Don't let your pride stop you. Summon your Mimic Tear, and you will conquer this world.

⚖️ The Verdict
The Greatest of All Time (GOAT). Despite my complaints about the delayed attacks, the sheer scale and ambition of this game overshadow everything else. It is an adventure you must experience.",1765983421,16028.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Speaking of the port, this thing runs way more fluid and better on a 30 FPS Playstation than in a modern Workstation PC. Horrendous port for computer experience!

The game also uses your full screen resolution and aspect ratio and introduces black bars to force an intended and completely frustrating game experience. 
The lack of support for Ultra-Wide aspect ratios and the never fixed washed up and constantly fluctuating HDR implementation is a thing you are forced to deal with. 

The requests for options by the customer to fix the issues are completely neglected by the developer!

1245620,english,True,"After around 500 hours across multiple platforms, I can confidently say that Elden Ring is one of the most extraordinary games I have ever played.

I earned the Platinum Trophy on both PS4 and PS5, reached > NG+7, and even started the DLC on NG+7 (don't you dare). Now, after building my own PC, I bought the game again on Steam – and somehow, it still feels fresh.

Every single time I start a new playthrough, despite knowing the map fairly well, I get that same feeling of genuine discovery. There is always the sense that I might stumble upon something I have never seen before – and every now and then, that’s actually true. Very few games manage to do this anymore.

In my opinion, Elden Ring succeeds where much of the modern industry fails. To give a small comparison: when Hogwarts Legacy released, I was disappointed by how every ""event"" on the map was immediately visible. Exploration quickly became repetitive. Outside of exploring Hogwarts itself, much of the world felt like filler.

Elden Ring takes the opposite approach. You are given a vast, unlockable map – but no minimap, only a compass. You don’t know what lies at a location. You might see what looks like a cave, a lake, a ruin, or a distant structure – that’s it. You go there, explore it, and accept whatever awaits you. The game doesn’t hold your hand, and that’s precisely why it works. The old Game Boy games – like Pokémon Red and Blue – didn't do it either. They rewarded you for trial and error.

Elden Ring is difficult, no question, but it rewards perseverance. While it doesn’t rely on the tightly interwoven level design of Dark Souls or Bloodborne, its open-world structure doesn’t weaken the experience – in fact, it strengthens it. The world, the soundtrack, the atmosphere: everything feels cohesive and unmistakably true to the FromSoftware formula.

That constant sense of tension, exploring unknown territory, getting ambushed, briefly fearing the loss of your runes; it all creates a level of immersion and excitement that keeps you pushing forward.

And then there’s the sheer variety of builds. Whether you want to become a powerful mage or fully embrace the Berserk vibe by wielding the iconic Guts-inspired greatsword – the choice is entirely yours. That freedom, depth and love for details is a huge part of what makes the game so special.

Another aspect I absolutely love is how the lore is not directly told. Instead of long cutscenes or exposition dumps, the story is hidden in item descriptions, environmental details, and subtle NPC dialogue. The game largely leaves you alone – and that's exactly what makes it so compelling. If you want to understand the world, you have to actively dig into it, piece things together yourself, and willingly fall down the rabbit hole. And if you don’t fully grasp something, the passionate community and lore-focused fanbase become an essential part of the experience.

In my opinion, Elden Ring will influence the gaming industry for at least the next decade or two. For me personally, it will remain one of the greatest games ever made – if not the greatest.",1765937798,467.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

1245620,english,True,"I genuinely love this game. My journey into Souls like games started with Dark Souls 3 to impress a guy, but I forgot about him and fell in love with the Souls like series itself. From there I moved on to Nioh 2, Dark Souls 1, and eventually the golden ticket Elden Ring.

What makes Elden Ring fun for me is the freedom in building your character. One second I'm running a pure strength build with dual colossel hammers, and the next I’m using a faith build blowing bubbles from a giant trumpet (yes, you read that right). The variety encourages experimentation and keeps the gameplay feeling fresh no matter how many hours you put in.

The characters and storyline are another standout. The world feels rich, emotionally engaging (catch me crying at war counselor Iji), and out of the six possible endings there are two that really stuck with me. 

Overall, Elden Ring is a game I’d easily recommend to anyone willing to dive into a challenging experience.

And I can honestly say that the open world nature of Elden Ring is it's greatest weakness. Vast expanses of landscape dotted with enemies scattered about that you can just bypass because you're on a HorseGoat. Sure...you can run into that boss far too early and really struggle and feel accomplished by beating it early, but more often than not I ran into bosses that were complete and utter pushovers. The dungeons would be the best part of this game if not for the high level of copy paste in each one. And Story? What story. Digging through obscure and obtuse item descriptions and NPCs that can be encountered in any order piece together...something?

There's nothing I hate more than weak hooks and half-assed introductions. It's the most essential part of any medium, especially games you spend $60 for. I spent more time in the Character Creation screen than I did actually playing the game and in the end I had to yiff some sliders I found online because making a character that doesn't look like Gollumina requires a Masters Degree. All of that just to find out that the game is just boring.

[h3]Keyboard and Mouse[/h3]
Unacceptable.

""Just use a controller,"" they say while they wipe the drool from their mouth and load up another asinine take in the chamber. Put it to your dome and keep it to yourself. It was goddamn 2022 when this game came out not 2015 and this is a billion dollar company. There are indie games with better ports long before the astroturfed virus killed less than 0.01% of the population. There is absolutely no excuse for this shit.

I'm not an unreasonable man however. I can look past major flaws as I am one myself but keep the flaws coming and there will be nothing of value left.

[h3]Enemies[/h3]
I believe this is simply a genre incompatibility issue. I never played classic Dark Souls games as I preferred more iconic classics like Line Rider and 5 Minutes to Keep Yourself Safe. If I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure and got trick-shotted by Kuromi holding mid in de_dust2 I wouldn't be surprised because I never played that genre before. I'd just assume that's how the game is like and decide it's not for me.

That's how I feel about this game. I kept trying to attack seemingly less dangerous NPC but the only thing I could kill was a bird and some cattle because they didn't fight back and died instantly. All the actual enemies would kill you within two hits. Again, maybe it's just how the genre is like. Seems interesting and I guess a certain kind of player might actually like that kind of gameplay but it's just not for me.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
[b]If you're wondering if you should get this game, don't.[/b]
Anyone who would actually enjoy this game would have already decided to purchase it because they know what they're getting into. If you've attempted Dark Souls and didn't find it appealing, this game won't be any more appealing. It looks more appealing than Dark Souls but it still plays like Dark Souls nonetheless and that series isn't even fun at all.

The combat is janky as all hell. The in combat controls are relatively terrible, like hit the arrow keys to switch weapons, but also need you hands on WASD and your mouse. Even on controller combat did not feel good, hold circle to run but you need to use triggers to attack but also hold down left trigger to shield or prep your skill/bow arrow. Want to quick heal mid combat? You're going to need to hit like 5 different buttons to find it in the inventory, equip it, the whole time you're dodging the enemies and then if you use it at the wrong time the enemy will hit you and negate any of the healing you just did. Ghost of Tsushima came out 2 years before and had far better combat than this game and still managed to be challenging and rewarding. Being purposefully obstreperous to create ""skill"" is not good design IMO.

The menu and controls are absolutely terrible. Q/E to move forward and backwards? I know its a fromsoft game, but there is no reason to make simple things like crafting and changing equipment obtuse for no reason. When I am using a controller the game is still telling me only the keyboard keybinds. So figure it out by experimentation or entering the crappy menus to look at the controls every 30 seconds until you memorize it. Why is it that other games will show you the proper controls for what you're using but in this game they can't have that simple QOL, purposefully obtuse design strikes again.

The open world is not great. I guess a lot of people enjoyed running around this area, but to me it feels empty and lifeless. A little bandit camp here, a few wolves or crab monsters there. Or better yet, follow a cool path around the mountainside. Guess what, it goes nowhere, now walk all the way back out. Your reward for beating this area, you get a white dot to interact with that gives you some recipe book that you immediately forget about.

Story? What is that? Just go explore.

I gave it the old college try and at no point in the few hours I played did I think ""man this is really fun I want to keep doing this."" Just doesn't have anything to keep me wanting to playing: no engrossing story, no enjoyable gameplay, just a barren open world to explore.

And it's absolutely gorgeous to look at! Apparently there were issues with performance on PC when it first came out, but either they've fixed that since then or it works better on Linux than Windows. Or I've just been lucky lol. It has run flawlessly for me so far. This is probably one of my all time favorite games. It's not perfect, however. There are some balancing issues, especially in the late game. As with all FromSoft games, there are sometimes issues with checkpoint placement and enemy placement. I really wish they would fix that. Checkpoints are a lot better here than in previous games, but they can still be an issue occasionally. Regardless, this game is amazing, and it's absolutely worth buying and playing from start to finish.

+ Big world where it is fun that different people progress in different areas. It seemed less linear than Dark Souls in some areas and more linear in some.
But the player option if he is stuck in one place to just explore somewhere else feels very good.
+ There is Levelling and Leveling spots which is a good part of auto-balancing and making the game easier.
+ The game has intense moments but also a lot of low-risk taking-in-the-vista moments, with nice weather effects and light. And the game needs it! This part felt a bit like Shadow of the Colossus just roaming around. So while it is a hard game, the balance of stress is much better than many other ""hard"" games
+ The world feeling is again gothic solemn dark souls-y which is distinct popular and kind of meme-y in a good way
+ Stakes of Marika remove long runbacks to boss rooms often

- It is hard and frustrating mechanics in some bosses, and the input-reading boss waiting for your attack or healing to time his attacks punishingly feels a bit bad.
- Malenia was too hard but is optional and a friend helped me!
- you can easily miss questlines and lock yourself out of questlines without using guides

The combat is great, but the bosses are overly aggressive and are clearly designed with Spirit Ashes in mind. They hit hard, give you little to no breathing room, and have huge health pools. Without summons and soul grinding this game is probably the hardest Soulsborne game. But the summons trivialize everything and make many bosses  easily beatable within 5-6 tries. They failed to strike a balance. 

The open world is just bad. Plain and simple. It's dead, lifeless, hollow, and every synonym of these words. It was fun to explore for the first few hours, but it gets really boring real fast. There is just so much repetitiveness (reskinned bosses, reskinned catacombs, ruins, caves, etc.) that it made me stop exploring and just rush through the game so I can move on to other games I wanted to play.

The storytelling is From's weakest area, yet they decided to create an even deeper lore, make it even more cryptic compared to the other games, and combined it with a HUGE open world so the story and lore are even harder to understand. 

The level design is still good though. I'll give the game at least that.

1245620,english,False,"Feels like I'm one of the few people who didn't really enjoy this game. Sure it's pretty, there are a lot of things from the game that will pull on the heart strings etc etc. But everything feels clunky, Playing on keyboard and mouse feels terrible. I mean who makes shift jump and space sprint? Yes you can change it but they bundled dodging together with sprinting so if you want to dodge you'd have to hit shift which is awkward so I felt forced to keep it to default. 

They throw a lot of things at you even as a long term souls fan I felt myself overwhelmed with all the new items abilities. They added crafting and grinding for resources and a bunch of other things that feel really out of place for a game like this. 

Yes I know this isn't dark souls 4 it's Elden ring, but it feels like dark souls with a different name then downgraded in a lot of ways added a bunch of clutter and messed up the controls. 

The fan base is rabid if you criticize the game even slightly they attack you saying ""git gud, you're just bad, the game is so easy just use magic or summons"" etc. Yes just don't play the way you want to play which was the whole point of the souls games (no set in stone classes) just ""only play magic and summons if you're struggling. Also if you play magic you're trash!"" Makes no sense to be forced into one play style because of poorly designed game mechanics, enemies designs and enemy placement.

While the game is undeniably beautiful it's hard to enjoy it when you keep getting lost, frustrated, and dying to everything because you're not supposed to go that way yet because you're under leveled. Even when you do go the way you're supposed to it feels like you're going the wrong way because they throw so much stuff at you that kills you instantly. They set up road blocks that make it hard to run past on horse which tells the player ""You're not supposed to go here yet"" even though that is where you're supposed to go.

Yes, dark souls 1 had something similar to this with the skeletons outside of fire link or the ghosts if you took the elevator down. The big difference is the game isn't open world so it made sense. ""I went this way and seemed way to hard, I went this way also too hard, let me go the only other way oh hey I can beat these hollows this must be the right way"" You felt like you can make good progress and know where you're going. It didn't hold your hand but also guided you in a way that felt natural. You could see you were making progress and getting to the next bone felt great. In this game they feel like they are everywhere where you don't need them and no where to be found in areas you do need them. You don't feel like you're ever making progress, the only thing in your mind is ""Am I even going the right way yet?""

 There is a faint way the game shows you where to go but I hate having to constantly check my map to make sure I'm going the right way being chased everywhere because even when you do go the right way you'll just get killed instantly by 20 ranged units shooting you across the map and almost never miss their shots.

There are a lot of enemies that just spam super powerful attacks that leave 0 opening for counter attacks. If you're lucky you'll get one hit in (but the trade off is he took out 95% of your health)

You can't turn off messages on the ground from other players, You might be thinking ""Well you couldn't do that in the other dark souls and it wasn't that bad."" Well unlike past dark souls games (like 1 and 3 since those are ones I've played for many hours) almost every square inch of land in certain areas are just covered in messages and 99% of the time it's spam unhelpful messages. They put them on top of levers in front of doors you want to open and of course the message pops up and not the thing you want to use. 

The only way to avoid this IS TO GO OFFLINE. Yes you read that right you have to GO OFFLINE to not have this happen. I guess they couldn't be bothered to add a toggle for messages. So if you don't want to see a glowing annoying message (which by the way the messages can easily be mistaken for items on the ground from a distance since they use similar if not the same glow) you have to disable PVP and summoning/getting summoned. Yes just turn off a major part of what fromsoft's games are known for just to not be flooded with idiots spamming random messages every two feet.

TLDR - The game overall isn't terrible. You'll either really love it or really hate it and I hated it.",1765628372,1304.0,True,False,False,1,1,0.458333343267440796

1245620,english,False,"Elden Ring is visually extraordinary and mechanically restrictive.

The world, lore, and environmental storytelling are exceptional. The art team and narrative contributors deserve praise.

Unfortunately, the core gameplay philosophy prioritizes punishment over expression. Boss design often enforces rigid behavior, discouraging experimentation and turning mastery into memorization.

I finished the game, but the final hours felt like endurance rather than engagement. Challenge should elevate the player, not domesticate them.

1245620,english,True,"Base game: Plenty of areas to explore, beautiful and rich in lore that ties well with DLC content. 

DLC: Map can be a little sparse and spread out in some areas. Even if there isn't anything to do, the empty area can be quite picturesque. Boss fights are significantly more challenging and interesting than the bosses in the base game.

Summary: This game is a must-have even if you do not intend on playing it much. This is one of those games perfect for playing in an apocalypse when you have way too much time to kill. Base game + DLC for the full experience. Replayability is excellent. The pricing on this game is extremely reasonable when compared against other games in the same price range. You will get your money's worth by purchasing this game because it is a 1000+ hour game.

Cons: Can be repetitive after you've 100%'d the game and have several completed runs under your belt. A lot of the game is traveling/running but the map is easy enough to navigate after gaining familiarity. Can seem like a difficult game at first but difficulty goes down with more hours spent playing the game. You may need to purchase a controller to enjoy the game because playing the game on keyboard and mouse feels weird.

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece—an extraordinary blend of breathtaking open-world design, stunning visual artistry, and deeply immersive storytelling. From the moment you set foot in the Lands Between, the sheer beauty of the world pulls you in. Every region feels handcrafted with love and imagination, from rolling golden fields and eerie swamps to haunting ruins and towering castles. Exploration never feels forced; the world quietly invites you to wander, discover, and get lost in its atmospheric charm.

The story, though subtle and mysterious, is absolutely fabulous. It unfolds like a grand myth, revealing itself piece by piece through encounters, item descriptions, and the world’s own history. The narrative invites curiosity and rewards attention, creating a sense of wonder rare in modern games. It’s a tale that sticks with you long after the final boss is defeated.

Elden Ring’s versatile playstyle is one of its greatest strengths. Whether you prefer brute strength, magic, stealth, archery, or a blend of everything, the game gives you the freedom to craft your own identity. Every weapon, spell, and build feels meaningful, and the flexibility ensures that no two players share the same journey. The combat is challenging yet fair, delivering some of the most exhilarating moments in gaming.

In every way, Elden Ring excels. It’s a game that celebrates exploration, creativity, and storytelling—an unforgettable experience that sets a new standard for open-world RPGs.

1245620,english,True,"As a veteran of previous Soulslikes like Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I went in expecting pure punishment—and while it delivers in spots, it felt noticeably more approachable for me. After 100+ hours, I'd rate it a solid 9.5/10. 

It's not just a Souls game; it's a revolutionary open-world RPG. Let's break it down, spoiler-free! First, the world of the Lands Between is breathtaking and brutally immersive. It's a seamless open world where you can gallop on Torrent (your spectral steed) across vast landscapes, from golden plains to poisoned swamps and towering castles. Sites of Grace act as checkpoints, and here's the game-changer: you can often just run past enemies to reach the next one. 

No more dying 50 times to a single pack—explore freely, level up, and come back stronger. That said, forts, castles, and legacy dungeons hit like classic Souls levels: tight corridors, ambushes, and boss gates that demand precision. It's the perfect balance—freedom with teeth. Combat remains FromSoftware's gold standard: weighty, deliberate, and oh-so-rewarding. I focused on a Strength/Dexterity build with heavy Endurance and Vigor investment for survivability.

Early game, my Curved Greatsword was a beast—ripping through foes with slashing combos that felt unstoppable. But late-game? You adapt or die. Pierce weapons shine against armored behemoths, and status buildup becomes king. I leaned into frost and blood procs on glaives and polearms—freezing enemies to slow them, then bursting with hemorrhage for massive damage. The build variety is insane: respecc at Rennala, mix Ashes of War, slap on talismans, and experiment endlessly. Bosses like dragons and demigods require strategy—dodge rolls, parries, and pawn-like summons (your spectral steed helps too)—but victories feel earned.Difficulty-wise, it was easier for me thanks to Souls experience. 

Open-world progression lets you overlevel threats, grab OP gear early, and cheese paths. Newcomers might rage-quit, but vets get tools to tailor the challenge. No hand-holding, but golden guidance scars point you right.

Graphically stunning on PC, soundtrack epic, and replayability infinite with NG+. But overall? Peak FromSoft—exploration, combat, and build-crafting perfection.If you're a Souls fan or open-world lover, Elden Ring is essential.",1765304338,7687.0,True,False,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988

Every location is unique, beautifully designed, and invites you to explore. The atmosphere ranges from mystical and calm to dark and overwhelming and that’s exactly what makes the game so captivating.

The soundtrack is absolutely masterful. The music fits perfectly in every situation, whether during exploration, intense boss fights, or quiet moments. It enhances the mood, builds tension, and often creates pure goosebumps.

The bosses are another major highlight. They are creatively designed, challenging, and incredibly epic in their presentation. Every fight feels like a special event. The lore and story, which gradually unfold, add a lot of depth and make the world even more fascinating.

For me, Elden Ring comes incredibly close to being a perfect game. It’s very near to what I would call a truly flawless and outstanding experience.

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring was the first soulslike game I ever completed 100% — all achievements, every boss, every corner of the map explored. No other game has ever pulled me in the way Elden Ring did: I kept telling myself “just one more area, just one more boss,” and suddenly dozens of hours had disappeared. The world, the lore, the music, and that feeling of overcoming impossible fights made it feel less like a game and more like a long, epic journey.

Now it feels like Miyazaki has “hooked” me into trying to finish every Souls game at 100%, because nothing else gives the same mix of challenge and satisfaction. Elden Ring didn’t just become one of my favorite games — it set a new standard for what I expect from action RPGs.

It's open world nonsense, repeated ad nausem. And for people who say each thing is unique, it's not. You'll see the same cabin over and over again. Sometimes It'll have the little offshoot building, sometimes it won't, sometimes it'll be mirrored, but it's the same damn cabin. It's the same camp. It's the same interiors of dungeons, just the layout is different. The same stalactites, the same patterns on the walls. Even the BOSSES repeat. I think there's... maybe a dozen BOSSES that don't repeat, out of... We got to Farum Azula and just... gave up. But all the content and side stuff beforehand. Even the first major boss has a repeat later. Yeah, the name is different, but the mechanics, movement, and model are exact (fine, the model is translucent, but that doesn't count. It shouldn't count!)

You fight one thing, you're pretty much GOING to see it again. And having to grind over and over for items to join up with my wife, and other things was just... unfun. And don't get me started on the random disconnects!

1245620,english,False,"Be prepared to spend the first 10-20 hours reading up anything about the game. Even how to aim a crossbow will require you to watch a youtube video, because it is never explained in game and requires 5 button presses. 
The pouch (quickslots) stopped working after 3 hours, so you would have to enter the menu and use the item from there and the menu does not pause the game, so basically you cannot use any item in fight.
Did not fix itself after restart, it's just broken now.
And the menu itself is painfully implemented. There are no tooltips whatsoever, it's like it was programmed 20 years ago. No tooltip what any stats do(only at level up), to see an explanation of the inherent skill of a weapon you can't see it in the gear screen, only in inventory after you use the ""switch view"" button, again no tooltip.

Many (small) enemies I encountered are very easy and in between there is here and there one boss enemy that is extremely difficult or often impossible with your current gear/level, you just don't have any indication about it beforehand. So you have to die to learn that. Often and everywhere.

I get it's supposed to be a hard game, but I fought mostly the controls, and the bosses, well maybe if you spend hours learning how fast every attack animation of the boss is you might time a dodge right? Some take long, some very long, some very fast and your own dodge is very slow (even with only medium weight equipped) so you have to just KNOW when the attack will land, you cannot SEE it. If I want to learn so many facts I will learn something useful like a new language, not timings. Let me dodge if I am fast enough to react.

1245620,english,True,"TLDR: Game is amazing, but Easy Anti Cheat is a piece of garbage that can crash your PC when launching.

This is the best souls game that I've played, and it ain't even close. Haven't played Bloodborne yet, so we'll put that into a little box. The open world does have a lot of copy paste, but most of it is decent and the main locations are great. Side locations can be really simple Bethesda tier dungeons, and others can be really creative and have a curveball at the end. The main locations are really good, and have many more unique elements to them than the simple caves, mines and crypts. Less tedious level design compared to DS1, and the enemies feel more fair than DS3, not that that game was always unfair feeling to me. The controls are amazing. A jump button can go a long way in games like this.

With all that being said, holy fk. I HATE Easy Anti Cheat. I hate it more than Denuvo (just hurts performance and nothing else. I hate it more than nProtect (not my favorite but still ok). Riot used some black magic when making Vanguard (doesn't crash lol). Easy Anti Cheat randomly crashes your PC when launching this game if it errors in any way. This can be before the game opens. This can be after the game opens and you're in the middle of the opening titles. This can be in a loading screen. It's even more likely if you tab over to your web browser and so much as click one thing. I have never encountered this much consistent crashing in a game, ever. I looked around and it can be due to applications conflicting with each other, ""hardware problems"" or ""outdated drivers"". It is the first one, without a doubt. My hardware is ok. My drivers are ok. No other game does this. I've had one or two other games crash on startup this year. Other games with Easy Anti Cheat. Funny. 

The fixes are to run the game or Easy Anti Cheat in the game files as administrator. Still happens. Repair tool for Easy Anti Cheat. Still happens. Verifying game files. Still happens. This piece of garbage needs to be fixed someday. Unacceptable that an anti cheat can crash a relatively healthy PC that isn't under load more than a few times. Besides, why should I need anti cheat when I play these kinds of games offline? Not Steam offline mode, but offline in the game settings. They shouldn't give a flying fk about anti when you're not engaging with any other players.

1245620,english,False,"TLDR: Elden ring is a beautiful game where tremendous effort was made on its presentation.
The gameplay is whatever results when the artistic vision is realized.
How much you like this game greatly depends on how much you value appearance over gameplay.

Early 3D games had all sorts of problems with camera positioning,
but clever developers have solved all of these problems by now.
FromSoftware is uniquely positioned in that they haven't figured it out yet.
There are many reviews complaining about not being able to see what's happening because of how the camera works,
but more intelligent players understand that FromSoft is appealing to the nostalgia of boomers
that remember what games were like in the 90's and long for simpler times.

Quests in this game are refreshingly structured and all follow the following formula:
I don't know where I am going, not telling you what I expect of you.
So please look up my quest on the wiki and talk to me in the next location mentioned there.

Later stages of the game have many bosses that are so gigantic that attacking them means your entire screen is filled with feet.
It's another brilliant move by FromSoft to be inclusive to feet fetishists,
a niche that is egregiously underserved in gaming, as haele 3D just doesn't have enough feet for us.

Whereas FromSoft revolutionized gaming by introducing tough but fair fights with Dark souls,
we don't need another rehash of a combat system that has already been milked dry.
As usual FromSoft treads new ground by removing all the fun game and seeing if you can still git gud?
The game was designed like a mathematical limit, where the closer you get to the end of the game,
the more the game strives to erode your motivation to keep playing it.
Out with rewarding skill development and mastery, in with the boredom and frustration maximization.
Playing the game feels like working on a job you have already long grown tired of.
Where in dark souls you lose your humanity in-game, in elden ring you lose your soul in real life.
They took the novel approach of not playtesting the last 20% of the game.
And that's what makes it so great!

Maybe fromsoft just got tired of all of the players that keep yelling:
""I've platinumed every single FromSoft game""
and used that as an argument of validity to their criticsm.
Here's Malenia, platinum that!

FromSoft truly opened my eyes to a wider world.
I now believe that the pinnacle of game design is adding a boss to the game so difficult,
that so many players summon another player to do it for them instead,
that the player that others summon actually becomes famous for it.
I never would have thought of game design from that angle before Elden Ring.

Other innovations include Elden ring's increasing emphasis on verticality,
but still having the controls of a game where the world is flat.
Running into the smallest step known to man stops you dead in your tracks.
You can see your foot going higher than the step, yet you stay stuck dancing the running man.
When rolling backwards these ledges will teach you brand new insights into physics.

Some of the design choices are refreshingly devious.
Smithing stones are sold all the way on the other side of the round table hold as the smith.
You can't put a currently equiped weapon into the stash,
so every time you try out a new weapon and put it in the stash you get to curse at the developers.

Grab attacks are amongst the most hated mechanics in souls likes.
So FromSoft made sure to use the mechanic exhaustively and even the weakest of mobs now have grab attacks.
In fact, how about sending huge armies of gank at the player, all of which execute grab attacks?
FromSoft brilliantly builds upon that by making the animation for getting up the slowest one ever to sit through.
Even I don't take that long to get up in the morning, but this chad takes his time in the middle of combat.

By the time you get to the end of the game, you will start dreaming about fromsoft.
I still remember vividly seeing Miyazaki and his clan dancing around me in circles wiggling their middle fingers.

Jokes aside, I've never been this bored and frustrated while playing a game, but I still worked through it.
I beat every single boss in the game once and I platinumed the game.
And the most rewarding part of it all is that I never have to play this game again.

Some things I didn't like:
-Fighting through the world didnt feel challenging enough
-Aside from treasure, most open world loot didn't have much use
-Not enough human-like enemies. It feels boring to fight just a bunch of oversized masses that flop themselves at you
-Even the final boss wasn't gratifying at all in stage 2. It is just another blob that then uses mobility, distance and burst spells to cheese you

Other thoughts:
-Fights with bosses like Malenia, Crucible knights, Malekith were all enjoyable and the game needs more enemies and bosses of that style
-You might lose a lot of runes in Haligree if you are trying to loot everything like me
-If you are struggling, it is probably 1 of 2 things... 1) you are in an area that your levels simply arent ready for yet or 2) you haven't yet figured out how to min-max your DPS with weapons/abilities/spells yet

Final thoughts: I have played about 20% of the DLC and just don't feel compelled to continue. Due to the reasons above

1245620,english,True,"I'd never played a Souls-themed game before. I knew the genre was difficult and I didn't enjoy it. I saw a friend playing Elden Ring for the first time, and he invited me to try it with him through the smooth co-op mode. I went into the game with a preconceived notion of how bad it would be, so I kept noticing flaws simply because I was focused on finding them. But the more I played, the more the game world surprised me.

The world feels endless. Every time you think you've reached the end, you stumble across new locations, secret areas, and enemies you've never encountered before. The enemy variety is amazing; each area has its own unique set of foes. The only other game I've seen this level of diversity is Hollow Knight. Furthermore, the landscapes are a masterpiece. The game offers a wide range of weapons, armor, and building options, whether you prefer to be a mage, a fighter, an archer, or anything else entirely, which adds a great deal of depth to the gameplay.

I finished the game with my friend, but later I replayed it on my own. That's when I started noticing some drawbacks. After my first experience, I tried other games of the same genre, such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Dark Souls III, and Dark Souls. Compared to these games, Elden Ring was surprisingly easy, especially after the developers released updates. My second attempt was easier, but not as enjoyable. I defeated the toughest bosses on my first try, but some enemies were able to hit me through walls. Sometimes, even the regular enemies you encountered would attack me the moment I entered the arena, which was frustrating during the entrance scene.

I also completed the downloadable content, and honestly, I regret buying it. It doesn't offer much for $26. I know it's just an add-on, but at that price, it should have offered something more valuable, especially compared to Silksong, which offered a lot for only $7.

Overall, I'd rate Elden Ring an 8/10. It's a great game and worth playing, regardless of its DLC. It's a game worth trying.",1764766661,7194.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

Instead of expecting success and rewards from it, you get the opposite. More failures is more rewarding than you think it is, even if it means punching a wall or breaking something, you learn from your mistakes. This game is one of a kind, it changed the way I've viewed games. Winning is not everything, winning is only a good feeling. Failing is a better feeling that makes winning feel more rewarding and celebrating. It teaches you a lesson of life. Failure. If you can't beat a boss in ELDEN RING, you're not a failure, you're only not giving up from there. If you're going through something tough in life, you're not a failure, you're only not giving up from there. You will win. It takes blood and tears to win in life and in ELDEN RING, but trust me, it will be worth it in the end.

1245620,english,True,"The base game is a good middle ground for players who want to challenge themselves, but don't want to reach a point where they either have to persevere or give up, as is the case with the Dark Souls series, for example. The open world makes it possible to avoid an overly strong opponent and return at a later point in time. There are also so-called ‘ghost ashes’, which represent summonings in battles that can make a difficult fight much easier. This makes the difficulty level more accessible.

The DLC is good, but a little harder than the base game.

As usual with FromSoftware games, the story is not very transparent, but rather has to be pieced together bit by bit. However, this results in a moderate story that, while not captivating me personally, did not disappoint me either. 

The graphics and soundtrack are well done and provide a fitting atmosphere for the different areas of the game. The immense size of the world contains many secret areas, items, NPCs and bosses that are a joy to discover. 

The PC controls also worked well.

The combat system offers many different ways to defeat your opponents, which suits the different preferences of the players. 

It didn't take much grinding to achieve all the achievements, which I found pleasant.

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring DLC Review: It’s So GOOD and So GODDAMN INFURIATING!

Okay, let’s start with the good: Elden Ring is a masterpiece. It’s absolutely worth buying the DLC, no question. The world-building is chef’s kiss. The open world, the lore, the bosses—it all hits differently than anything else out there right now. The way the DLC expands on the already staggering universe? Pure magic. New areas? Insane. New enemies? Wild. But here’s the kicker: the bosses.

Now, here’s where my patience starts fraying like a rope after a marathon of frustration. FromSoft has done what they do best: they’ve created bosses so fucking hard, you’ll want to throw your controller into the goddamn void. And I mean hard in the way that makes you question everything you’ve ever known about your own existence. Your reflexes? Ruined. Your sanity? Shredded. That one boss that just sits there looking at you, and then out of nowhere slams you into oblivion for the fiftieth time? Yeah, I’m still salty.

Look, the difficulty is part of the charm for a lot of people. It’s what makes Elden Ring Elden Ring, right? But holy hell, sometimes I wonder if they just want us to suffer for fun. They know they’ve built a challenge that’s nearly sadistic, and yet… I can’t stop playing. I’m addicted. I keep going back. Even as I rage so hard I could probably break something, I’m still here, asking for more punishment. And the rewards are worth it—but goddamn, the cost is high.

In the end, this DLC is so fucking good that you’ll keep playing, even after your entire being wants to rage-quit, fist-pump your way through a wall, and never look at a FromSoft title again. But hey, if you’re a masochist who loves the idea of repeatedly smashing your face against an unyielding wall of difficulty, then yes—BUY THE DLC. You won’t regret it… or maybe you will, but you’ll keep playing anyway.",1764712398,6437.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring was the first game I ever platinumed, and for a long time I considered it the peak of gaming. After exploring other titles, it has not aged as flawlessly for me, but I still hold it in high regard and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a true open world experience. Unlike games that feel empty or overly curated, Elden Ring delivers scale, density, and meaningful exploration.

The world is rich in story, but the game does not convey its narrative in a traditional way. Most of the lore must be pieced together through item descriptions, environmental clues, and supplementary YouTube explanations. Without that extra effort, you are often left unsure of what is happening or why. The absence of quest markers adds to the sense of freedom, but it also makes it very easy to lock quests, miss key items, or unknowingly cut yourself off from certain endings.

In terms of difficulty, I never found the game overwhelming. The only encounter that felt significantly demanding was Messmer in the DLC. The game allows you to farm levels freely and exploit a variety of strategies that make many bosses manageable. I am a dexterity-focused player and used one katana (Nagakiba) for most of the game. I parried Malenia on my first attempt, which is why I find it amusing that some content creators dramatize dozens or hundreds of attempts using mage builds.

The build system is another point of friction. While the number of options is impressive, it can be stressful to navigate such a wide range of possibilities. A more intuitive structure would have made experimentation less overwhelming.

Graphically, the game is solid, but it is not exceptional. Older titles like God of War (2018) still surpass it visually, especially on PC.

Despite its flaws, Elden Ring is absolutely worth playing. It offers a unique sense of discovery and scale that few games achieve. Just avoid turning it into your entire identity. Step away, get some perspective, and enjoy it alongside other great titles.",1764651112,24319.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring felt like it’s the culmination of all FromSoftware games that came before it. It’s everything they learned from them and more. If you’ve played other FromSoftware games, you’ll stumble upon a lot of familiar things, scenarios, locations, enemies, bullshit, and they took all that and put it in a huge open world map.

The map itself is vague. If you like the “zero hands holding” approach, this is your game. Not only do you not know what to do next, but things are hard as they are in your average souls experience, you wander into the wrong neighborhood, and there goes all your runes.

This is the most polished experience from the series. It’s visually beautiful and beautifully crafted, the world has much variety, some copy pasted landmarks but also lots of unique places with good interiors and architecture. I know some people complain that some enemies repeat, but even with that, there are tons of variety in this aspect as well.

Unlocked new fear of insects, centipedes, ants, fingers? They replaced spiders with fingers, and I don't know which is worse now... 

I have mixed feelings about the gameplay. For most people, they nailed the combat in this one, and it's true, but there are some annoying things. 

Unlike DS2, you can attack and dodge quite a lot before running out of stamina, which promotes faster gameplay, and that's usually what people seek and enjoy. To balance that, bosses also unleash a fury of successive fast attacks, and sometimes the window during which you can attack without being punished is really small, so the fight ends up with more downtime (defense time) than attacking, and that can be boring. 

I'm not talking about op builds and cheeses, those exist, but I'm speaking of a normal first playthrough experience. 

It feels like mobs don't have a stamina bar as u do. That was a nice feature from Nioh, being able to see the enemy's stamina bar. 

Another issue is how huge bosses are, now it's not new, but man, it's becoming ridiculous. I know people loove to fight big bosses, but I use M&K because I like complete camera control, and even then, I don't even see all the boss. Some fights I don't see the hit because it's impossible to have all the boss within the camera frame, neither by locking the view nor by unlocking it. 

Other than that, I absolutely love the animations, the weapon variety, the spell effects, the class variety, and mix and matching, all the new features are fun to play with. 

On a more personal note, even though this game has everything, even things from previous souls games, more features, more work into it, I still think that experiencing similar features was more iconic in previous titles. If you're new to the genre, this game is a fantastic place to start. It has everything, and it's modern, but for me, I still find DS1 to be the most iconic and the most beautiful journey, but maybe cause I played it first, we will never know.",1764605866,4475.0,True,False,False,47,4,0.699447333812713623

1245620,english,True,"As my first game of the genre, it is memorable and I took my time, mostly exploring the gorgeous world.  I am glad to have used a guide for some parts and I did save scum endings (I'm a working adult ain't nobody got time for that) they were nice, albeit mostly short. 

I would recommend anyone who has the time to delve into the game and enjoy its mechanics play, regardless of the ""git gud"" sentiment. How one spends their free time is up to them because we all have free agency :) 

Despite how big the game is though, certain mechanics like madness spells are lore relevant and important, but fizzle out too quickly. The entire plotline and mechanics surrounding it are cool, and supposed to be powerful, but at the end of the day are not.  It's also frustrating to say that my favorite boss (Radahn) lore wise is INCREDIBLY powerful, but his boss fight is so weak. There is a disconnect because mechanics that are hyped up to be strong, yet fall short by miles. When you engage with the world and create expectations based on what characters are saying, only for them to be dashed it does take away from the game.

I will say the second half of the game is primarily a boss rush and that took away from the hundred+ hours of exploration, as I was just fighting the same boss on repeat. For the genre of the game, it makes sense, but I think it takes away from the overall experience. 

I spent many hours dying and running around looking at how in-depth the world and its zone were. From the empty fields of Limgrave, toxic pools of Caelid, ruined lakes of Liurnia, desolate volcano of Altus, shining brillance turned ashen capital Leyndell, supernatural underground zones, freezing storms of Snowfield, and crumbling ancient architecture of Farum Azula, there is character. So much character it feels awful getting into the second half of the game that has much smaller zones that feel like just large dungeons. 

In a world of happy endings, Elden Ring rarely has a quest end positively. It does help build the world as a dark and depressive environment, where people are forced to make the best with what little they have. My first quest ever involved a blind girl at a cart asking me to find her father in a castle and the result made me sad. The writing is there, but you can tell what George influenced. He has the capacity for a great fantasy setting, but likes to write some morally messed up story lines, especially with Marika/Radagon. 

The DLC will be played another day, but as someone who tried to do everything, it is a lot and was a great journey. My attacks had ""oomph"" and the possibilities to spec your build into something unholy is always an attractive option.

All in all, the open (but dull and essentially empty) world, supposedly brilliant writing (that is hardly present in the game), repetitiveness, 99% garbage loot, and grind eventually took it out of me.

Just you, your sword, and your shield against this unfair world of monsters.

The late-game one-shot potential of ordinary enemies, especially ones that are reused is my main critique. For me at least, I just end up avoiding a lot of fights in the late game vs feeling a meaningful and enjoyable increase in difficulty. The late game bosses are a bit over-tuned I felt as well, with some feeling like sekiro enemies, while you are stuck with ER mechanics. 
On another note, the game is in dire need of a quest log or something of the sort. Trying to navigate some storylines is near impossible without a guide. You should just have the ER wiki ready to go when you load up the game and accept using it.

By mid-game I was sprinting around dual-wielding what were basically two kitchen knives, throwing rocks at gods like that somehow counted as a strategy. I was beating dragons, giants, monsters… yet still losing every single fight with gravity.

Elden Ring isn’t just a game. It’s an experience that sticks with you long after you turn it off. From the moment you step into the Lands Between, you realize you’re playing something truly special. The world is massive, mysterious, beautiful, and terrifying all at once — and none of it feels empty. Every corner hides a secret, every horizon pulls you in, and every enemy demands respect.

The combat is brutal but fair, and the boss fights are some of the most unforgettable encounters I’ve ever had in any game. The sense of achievement after overcoming a tough challenge is unmatched. The game never holds your hand, but it constantly rewards curiosity, patience, and skill.

The atmosphere, music, lore, characters… everything comes together perfectly. It’s dark, epic, emotional, and full of moments that feel legendary. I genuinely felt like I was carving my own story.

Elden Ring isn’t just my favorite FromSoftware game — it’s one of the greatest games ever made. If you’re hesitating, don’t. Just dive in and let the world consume you.

It blew all expectations I had out of the water.
Its world, so compelling and enormous. Its art direction, ubelievable.
It has impossible variety and depth in weapons, playstyles, enemies, attack patterns, ashes of war and more.

The open world feels like such a natural and organic evolution seeing how well it is used.
Level design, more complex and surprising than ever. The exploration you will naturally do helps showcase that constantly.
Exploring the Lands Between is an incredible experience and the first time you do is the most special, so just go in blind and get lost, don't spoil anything for yourself.

The story, the world, the fantasy, its characters, bosses and their story, all equally opaque, majestic and grandiose at the same time.

It all feels like leaps forward and upward from previous games and I think it will be hard to go back.

Besides all the gushing praise, it sadly didn't run great. Maybe a 5000 series GPU problem, but the fact remains that the fps rarely felt like 60, it was fluctuating and there was microstuttering probably contributing to that. Some areas didn't exhibit this problem however.

It plays fine on keyboard and mouse which is what I used, but requires some rebinding, the defaults won't be comfortable for anyone.

1245620,english,True,"There's so much great about this game, and so much terrible!  The great:[list]
[*]Combat is great!  It's got depth, it's challenging, and mostly it's fair.  There's a big variety of enemies (though they still get a little repetitive thanks to the sheer size of the game) and a huge variety of weapons to kill them with.
[*]Exploration is about as good as it gets.  Any cliff could have a ledge below it you might jump down to.  A large tree could be hiding a door into a cave.  Illusionary walls seemed a bit cheap at first, but there are often 'tells' like sounds coming from the other side of them.  Entire maps can be hidden away where many players can miss them!  Note that the online option can spoil this badly, though.  It's hardly a secret door when there are half a dozen messages around it telling you it's there.
[*]Art direction is great, too.  Technically, the graphics don't seem to be using the most advanced technology, but the artists did very well with what they had.
[*]Boss fights are well done.  When you beat a boss, it typically won't take even five minutes.  Of course, many of them will require some experimentation, which does mean dying and starting again a few times, but there will also be some you're particularly well suited for that will finish on your first try.  Battles against dragons can take longer, but they're also incredibly good fights with the dragons flying off a short distance and breathing fire (or whatever) at you.
[/list]

On the not-so-good side:[list]
[*]Quests.  Yeeesh!  I guess the fun of the quests came in the early days when the game was released, and the community was working together to figure them out.  If you want to follow them yourself, you'll NEED to look up guides because the NPCs have a habit of moving around a lot - and I don't mean just from one side of town to another.  The rewards, if there are any, can be pretty weak or really strong... unless it doesn't fit your build, which it often will not.
[*]Story.  There IS a story in this game, but you have to dig it out by reading item descriptions and thinking about what you're seeing.  If you're an investigative reporter or historian, you'll like sifting it out.  For everyone else... lots of hassle for very little reward.
[*]You know how those old JRPGs before, oh, 2005 or so would always make you keep talking to an NPC over and over until their dialog repeats to find out everything they want to say?  FromSoft still thinks it's a good idea.
[*]There's zero lip syncing, too.  NPCs jaws just flap away until they finish.
[*]Tone is incredibly bleak.  Could somebody please be happy!?  Preferably not because you ripped off some poor sod's skin.
[*]Every time you gain a level you get to add one point to one statistic.  You'll likely gain a good 130+ levels over the course of the game so you will definitely advance in power, but every step is tiny.  For me, at least, that takes away some of the fun.  I like to be able to see a difference after gaining a level - maybe not a big one, but something I can at least notice.
[/list]

The game's difficulty isn't quite what I thought.  If you die, you drop all your runes.  Runes are money in this game, but keep in mind that gaining levels costs runes.  They will stay roughly where you died and, as long as you come back and pick them up before dying again, there's no penalty except for the time it took you to get from the last save point to that location.  So, when you see a challenge ahead, you're going to very much want to put it off until just after you buy a level or otherwise deplete your rune count.

The game is a one-save-only style game.  As such, you'll want to back up your save just in case something goes wrong.  I never heard of any game bugs corrupting a save, but computers can do weird things, and it only takes a few seconds.  The game saves itself very often quitting the game will save in that spot.  I wouldn't try doing it in the middle of a boss fight, but those fights almost always end inside of five minutes.  The game won't do well if you need to quit at any second, but if you can get 5 minutes notice, you should be fine.

All in all, I very much enjoyed the game.  I [b]really[/b] loved the exploration.  (If you're an explorer type gamer, don't worry too much about the difficulty - you'll spend so much time exploring everything that you'll be over-levelled soon enough.)  People that love deep action combat should try the game, too.  If you're more into the stories that RPGs can tell, though, this isn't your game.",1764309270,11924.0,True,False,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988

1245620,english,True,"I never could get a grasp on souls-likes before Elden Ring. They always frustrated me because you couldn't do anything except bang your head against the same wall (boss) until you defeat it and hit the next wall, or stop playing. 

This is the first souls-like I completed. The #1 thing that let me stick it out was the fact that there is always something else to do if you find a boss you can't deal with at the moment. The #2 thing that really made me fall in love was the fact you can be a true tank despite the purists poo-pooing that playstyle. 

There's also nothing wrong with throwing in an mod making you very overpowered, because experiencing the sense of wonder the game provides is plenty worth it. I got my friend to play with me in the co-op mod, and even with his absolute hatred towards souls-likes he proceeded to fall in love just as I did. 

It still has classic, chunky, weighty combat that takes a bit of getting used to.

The trouble with it is that's extremely bloated and far overstays its welcome by drawing things out. It's an enormous kiddie pool with a lot of empty space and not a lot of depth. What you end up with is an experience where you spend most of your time traveling without a lot of action, hit up the necessary bosses and encounters, and make a few pit stops along the way for the things you need while ignoring the roughly 80% of the bland, recycled, and obnoxious filler. There's some 400 weapons and of those weapons maybe 10-20% ever get used. Bosses get repeated often and minor locations are very dull and uninteresting. 

The pacing is also incredibly bi-polar. The first few locations are a breeze, Things pick up a little bit at a time getting into the middle of the game, around the point where you're getting through the capitol. After that things dive off a cliff. Bosses start becoming extremely unforgiving with 9 hit wombo combos, massively inflated damage, and speed and mobility that make them a miserable chore to fight. Regular enemies too gain a jump in health, damage, and poise making them suck considerably more. I've completed this game several times now and every time I want to do a run through I hit a wall right after the capitol where my motivation to continue drops because I remember how unpleasant the last chunk is.

Super fun once you get the hang of it, and I really really love delving into the lore of it all. Certainly a good start if you're looking to try a Souls game or soulslike, but don't know where to start. The open world aspect means you can leave and come back later if you feel stuck on a boss or area, so you aren't forced to fight something if you aren't having a great time. Of course, that doesn't mean it's easy; it's still a hard game, no matter where you go, but the option to go wherever you want (for the most part) makes it a fun experience.

After 21.4 hours, I can confidently say Elden Ring is one of the most immersive experiences I’ve had in gaming. The world feels alive — every corner hides something worth discovering, whether it’s a new boss, a hidden dungeon, or just breathtaking scenery. The combat is punishing but fair, and every victory feels earned.
What really stands out is the freedom: you’re never forced down a single path. I’ve spent hours just exploring, finding my own way, and still feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. The sense of scale and mystery keeps me hooked, and I’m loving every moment.

1245620,english,True,"I'm gonna start a review chain on how much I've played the game. For context I haven't played a single Dark Souls game, but I have played A LOT of hard games (most notably both Hollow Knights and 700 hours of Terraria Infernum, which are all hard games with you having to learn the attacks of enemies and bosses). Spoiler warning and I hope I have a long, infuriating and rewarding adventure so I can make this chain giant :).

0 hours - I started a knight build, because I don't know anything about the game and want some gear to help me get a good start. It will probably be super fun to replay the game with different builds like classes in Terraria.

6 hours - I am still in the very early game, since I cannot really beat the first boss, Margit. I have decided after looking for some beginner advice to explore other areas and get stronger that way. For now I have a sword (I forgor the name) that has spinning slash as a strong attack and have upgraded it with two smithing upgrades from some swordsmith in a grace world that Melina took me to. I then found some portal-ish thing that brought me to a fight with Bloodhound Darriwil. Super fun fight to learn, took me like 15 minutes to kill and dropped a very good sword... which I can't equip because it requires a bigger strength and dexterity level :(.",1764099609,380.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

1245620,english,True,"Definetly a 10/10 game, no doubt.
One of the most fleshed out and awesome combat systems in the history of gaming. And it's not as difficult as people say. There are lots of ways to make your game easier, like summons. And if you're stuck on a boss for too long, you can also ask for help from other players. (But don't do that, that'll ruin your experience).
The graphics have become drastically better, than ones of its predeccessors. It's not dark and depressing anymore, don't trust the trailers. Although, that is a two-edged sword, as the game isn't optimized really well. It's pretty CPU and RAM heavy so you'll pretty might not be able to play while having many other programs open depending on your device (or just will have to close everything except the game like me).
Many try to say it's worse than dark souls, which in my opinion is just OGs coping. Dark souls is a wonderful series, although it's over a decade old, with the latest release being like a decade old too now. Elden Ring expands on Dark Soul's mechanics, adding stuff like jumping or making magic fun for once (even tho i was a dex build).
People, who dislike the open world are genuinely weird to me. The beauty of soulslikes is exploration. And imo this genre fits the game.
The voice actors did a great job, with me still not being able to forget some of them.
The game hyped so much that many try to roast it hard. And that ain't fair. The game is wonderful.
The cons are:
- The optimization is honestly meh.
- Even though the narrative and quests are awesome, the endings feel lackluster. Most of them just show a different tree in the end cutscene, that's how they're different. And you will get rolled back to the state of the game before you got the ending after. And these lackluster endings are one ending per playthrough. That's no big deal, but that's just stupid, because you can't get another ending. Let's take hollow knight. There you can get every ending per playthrough, so the rollbacks make sense. P.S. I just want my platinum, why do I need 2 extra playthroughs for it?

Yeah, unless your pc specs are bad, give Elden Ring a shot. It's awesome.",1764092593,7338.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5

I’ve poured 252 hours into Elden Ring and can proudly say I’ve defeated every single boss, including the secret optional one. This isn’t just a game—it’s an experience, a sprawling RPG that perfectly balances challenge, freedom, and storytelling.

From the hauntingly beautiful world design to the sheer depth of combat, every corner of the Lands Between feels purposeful. Exploration is endlessly rewarding, whether you’re uncovering hidden dungeons, secret NPC quests, or massive optional bosses that test your skills to the limit.

The gameplay is tight, responsive, and endlessly versatile—you can experiment with builds, weapons, and magic to tackle challenges in countless ways. The lore is rich and cryptic, encouraging curiosity and rewarding those who pay attention to every detail.

In my opinion, Elden Ring sets a new standard for open-world RPGs. It’s punishing, yes, but every victory feels earned and every discovery feels magical. Few games leave such a lasting impression, and this one will stay with me for years to come.

1245620,english,True,"Elden Ring probably my favorite game of all time.

Pros

Very good customization 
Very good Graphics and atmosphere.
The lore is very good.
Good characters that you can meet around the map.
Combat is fun and challenging.
Extremely good map with lots of places to explore, monsters, bosses and etc.

Cons

The side quests don't tell you where you need to go to complete it.
The bosses can get really spammy.

If you like the base game for Elden Ring I recommend trying out the DLC Shadow Of The Erdtree. 
Overall phenomenal game 10/10 for me.",1763971238,25365.0,True,False,False,0,0,0.5
