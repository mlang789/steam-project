These are the games I grew up with, and getting to play them again after so many years feels unreal.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours, I was completely back in those worlds. The vibes, the music, the cities—it all came rushing back like no time had passed. San Andreas and Vice City especially feel different now, in the best way. It’s not just playing a game anymore, it’s reliving a part of my childhood."}

Even though I still like Vice City. Very glad to have seen it remastered as I highly enjoyed playing it since the original PC port of the game did not translate well at all. There are frustrating missions in the game but they are still manageable once you get the hang of them. Had so much fun playing it and highly recommend it for any GTA fan. I would say that GTA IV and GTA V are still my top but San Andreas is definitely right up there for sure."}

I wanted to relive my childhood, but instead I ran into a broken mess. Thanks, Rockstar, for once again ruining something that used to be fine.\r\n\r\nI just don’t get the point — why ruin the camera in the remake? Bring back the old version instead of making these pointless “remasters.” Playing this game on PC feels like being forced to use a console, and it’s unbearable.\r\n\r\nThe camera is absolutely awful when driving — it makes your eyes bleed, you can’t even tilt it up properly, and it constantly centers itself like in a console port. Basically, they just dumped the console version onto PC.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t even find a proper mod to restore the old camera behavior. So yeah — terrible experience overall."}

Not even a pause button (though the game can be paused by a secret technique players found). \r\n\r\nI deeply and wholly recommend this game to anyone who has doubts about the Souls series. \r\nI also recommend this game to anyone else.

Characters 10/10. Its good to see cyberpunk in its all prime after the disastrous launch. Really appreciate how CD Projeckt pulled off cyberpunk from the grave. \r\n\r\nAnother key factor about cyberpunk which i really liked is the game design. I've around 150+hr in cp but still cant remember the way without map, its kinda dense and complex which makes us feel like we are actually visiting the place we visited multiple times feel like a new place."}

A lot of beautiful dungeons to explore, the raids are a ton of fun and getting better gear feels really good.\n\nThat is, it would feel good if it didn't feel so shit.  The 5% chance of getting leveling a weapon up after grinding all day only to be set back and there's NOTHING you can do but wait till tomorrow to try again feels shit.  It makes the game take much longer, I get it, it pads out the content to keep players whittling away until more content comes out, but it sucks, no other way about it.  I put up with it as long as I did because the gameplay, dungeons and raids are top notch and a ton of fun.  But I can only spend 4 hours a day doing the same exact grind over and over again before I burn out. Not even gonna cover how you can just pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to just speed up the gear grind like some dogwater mobile game.\n\nOnly play this game if you want to make an mmo your after work part time job.  I want to recommend the game, and it is free so try it out maybe you'll like it but its just too much for me."}

Its far smoother than PD2 in terms of gameplay, but it's very much the say gameplay loop with some added variation. getting a party together is also a million times easier than in PD2. That being said, it's hard to get behind their overhaul of the monetization when upgraded edition owners now have to buy a Y1 pass for $30 to get 2 $10 heists, which is.... kinda what they aimed to move away from. $30 for the 4 isnt the worst thing, but not accounting for that has likely cost them quite a few y1 pass sales. Either way, it's certainly a game id rec, but don't buy the upgraded editions unless they have the y1 pass, otherwise just grab the base and go from there, no extra cosmetics are worth cash, but ymmv."}

The writing is pulpy sci-fi noir that still manages to make you feel things. It's nice to play a game where the choices are more than binary and actually affect the story. Gameplay is solid, character build-out is fun and flexible. Killer soundtrack on every count (I can't stop listening to 'Gate K9'). The world is engrossing with so many little details & easter eggs even beyond any of the listed missions/jobs/gigs. I bought this after having already returned it a few years ago due to how buggy it was at the time, and I'm glad I revisited it."}

The gameplay is extremely difficult but satisfying, the world looks amazing, and the story is great. It doesn't really have any directions except for \"Kill God\" and that's all you get. Doing any side quests is almost impossible without looking up a guide. But its fun to be walking around and then randomly run into a new boss you've never seen before and die. The DLC, however, doesn't give you a starting \"Hey, go do this\" and if it did I missed it. The DLC is very punishing, and definitely feels like FromSoftware doing everything possible to make your game as hard as possible. You are maidenless, you are unworthy even to graft, and every moment of being so is awesome."}

I also find it a lot easier than the original. The updated graphics are easier on the eyes than the OG version, and the bugs are actually pretty fun but mostly all fixed now.\r\nI find the story very interesting; the missions are great and not so repetitive. The humor is spot-on, and the critique of the American way of life goes deep. \r\nThe DE version has some things missing compared to the OG version, so if you want the real experience, play the PS2 generation or Xbox 360 generation versions.\r\nWould recommend 100%."}

My final conclusion to this game is that I wish they would just do better, or if you have a way to buy the original version, go for it and use a downgrader so you can have the original music that developers intended.\n\nEdited - 11/13/2024\nThis latest update has fixed my crashing issue for You've Had Your Chips and was able to go through the rest of the game without crashing."}

(this is why I don’t play this to do anything but sneak around)\n\nThe game and DLC is just not worth full price, but at the state that the game is currently in it feels like they’d have to overhaul the entire progression system and weapon balance in order to make it worth it not on sale and I’m starting to believe that ship has already sailed.

The maps have been much more interesting than the grey blob 2000s maps that I experienced in the beta, the weather system adds more life to them on top of the already better design. The attachment system lets me adapt on the fly and the specialist give a lot of personality while letting you define your playstyle. The game also lets me play medic with the weapons I prefer, the bf cult would rather force me to lug around a heavy mg and only ever play with mgs as a medic because that makes the game more fun?

Although, as I have only played this edition this Dec 2024, a lot of the bugs I experienced are usually UI or minor issues that doesn't prevent me from progressing through the story line.\n\nAs someone who played the original back in the PS2, I can honestly say how nostalgic this game is and how the definitive edition made tweaks that made it better -- graphics, more \"enter-able\" shops / buildings, and the new weapon wheel makes it easier to switch weapons."}

Here you got nice graphics. And that is all positive I could say.\r\nIt was and still is a game of patience. In the past in respect to your playstyle. Which still applies, though. BUT...finding a lobby and starting a heist also takes its time. \r\nAnd don't get me to your loadout. You can buy quiet a few weapons. But use them? Well, you can but don't expect them to be leveled up or very useful. You earn lots of cash and mods. Which is nice. But it takes just too much time to install those because you need to level every goddamn weapon up...so annoying.\r\nI bought it for around 10€. It's not worth more."}

I love this game since you can't go in sword swinging or else your getting punished.  It teach's you real things you can apply in your real life as well.  And i think that's what made my love for this game so strong and don't want to stop playing.  It can make you want to quit when you die but you'll never truly fail unless you give up.  It's so fun exploring new areas or fighting a difficult boss even if your getting destroyed, it's still fun.  I love dying in stupid ways since it makes me laugh almost every time.  Give it a try if your wanting to get into these types of games.  Elden ring has proved it self to fun, fair, and difficult challenge and adventure.  Can't wait for the dlc and ng+."}

The threat of bots is always alive as long as Valve continues to funnel the majority of tf2's playerbase into their own servers, where they do little to no moderation.\r\n\r\nValve should bring back the ability to select teams, in order to keep games balanced. Valve should also bring back the quickplay system. It kept both Valve servers and dedicated community servers populated. And matches within community servers are allowed to go on for hours, meaning you can play on the same map/gamemode to your heart's content.\r\n\r\nTf2, as a software, was developed by Valve, yes.

After playing for two years, I reached a point where the endless grind became exhausting (I quit in June 2024). The introduction of Tier 4 felt like a missed opportunity for a fresh start, which could have brought new and returning players onto the same playing field. Unfortunately, it ended up being the same cycle, just with new materials and \"upgraded\" skills. I understand this is a Korean MMORPG, so grinding is expected, and the game constantly triggers FOMO. However, with the recent change in directors, I hoped Tier 4 would offer a meaningful reset, helping us move past the brutal Tier 3 grind.\n\nThe game was fun, but maintaining progress (with alts and farming gold) eventually became overwhelming.\n\nIf you're still reading, my advice is simple: enjoy the game, but don’t let it become a second job. Treat it for what it is.. a game.\n\n6/10"}

The ONLY way I can see the game being better is if StarBreeze actually SELL the PAYDAY license to another company. The game is still an embarrassment after two WHOLE years of it being out. NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE. The ONLY thing that DID (majorly) change was just really only armor, but even then.. it's still kinda a shadow of PAYDAY 2, even PAYDAY THE HEIST. A lot of the game just felt rushed and sloppy when slapped together. Mainly the whole \"Online only\" thing, that basically has NO reason to be online.. why? No clue. The game feels more like a fan project that gets nothing correct and constantly tries to appease their fumbling fanbase by adding \"new\" and \"riveting\" gameplay. The last DLC I played was Party Powder.. and it was a bit lackluster. I'd say \"wait a year\" but it's pretty clear that they BARELY have a year with how much the game flopped, to the point where they needed to cancel their D&D game JUST to give the devs more people to work on PAYDAY 3. I'd just say I won't recommend the game at all, EVEN if they somehow get their things together."}

Likovi izgledaju kao da su napravljeni od gline. Oružja zvuče jezivo loše – pucnjevi nemaju nikakvu težinu ni realističan zvuk. Jednostavno... bez reči. Očekivao sam mnogo više. Veliko razočaranje.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis remaster is terrible. The game is full of bugs – I played it right when it launched and it’s still a disaster. NPCs fall through the ground, some missions are literally unplayable because the AI bugs out or spawns inside objects, making it impossible to progress. I randomly fall through the map all the time.\n\nAs for graphics? The characters look like they're made of clay. And the weapon sounds? Just awful. Gunshots sound weak and unnatural – no impact at all. Honestly, I’m speechless. I expected way more. Huge disappointment."}

There’s something satisfying about being the backbone of a squad, making sure our armor stays operational while dishing out damage with launchers and gadgets.\r\n\r\nI’ve also leaned into being a taker — pushing aggressively to capture points, secure vehicles, and turn the tide of fights. Whether it’s locking down a sector solo or coordinating with teammates, those moments of chaos and control make the game rewarding.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, I’ve logged plenty of time in the skies as a pilot. Mastering helicopters and jets has been a huge learning curve, but flying support runs, evading missiles, and delivering precise strikes feels incredible when it all comes together.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the experience has been a mix of teamwork, skill, and sheer adrenaline — and even after 100 hours, Battlefield 2042 still finds ways to surprise me."}

I know that on Steam, it becomes cool to hate on games that are hated on by others - whether to get rewards or whatever from others. Having seen the reviews for BF2042, I had very low expectations.\r\n\r\nBut, at $3, and with a Road to BF6 event for free, what was there to loose?\r\n\r\nSimply put, I had a lot of fun. I finished the BF6 event, and enjoyed my journey there. After years of patches, and content updates, and changes - the final state of BF2042 is actually a lot of fun. Honestly I enjoyed it more than BF1 or BFV - neither of which did I personally find enjoyable, especially BFV, which has nothing do with WWII.\r\n\r\nI especially like the option to just play against AI if you so choose. Sometimes you just want to sit back and relax, and playing against the AI is a great way to do that, especially with others.\r\n\r\nOn sale, I think there is tremendous value to this game. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. And thats from a BF player who has been here since day 1 that there was a BF."}

The most fun quest I had was collecting all the Dalaman cars, and mainly cause of an easter egg to a previous game that I loved. (no spoilers).\n\nSunning graphics, audio is mediocre at best, and the main storyline is ok. Some of the side quests are horrid and tourtous to complete.  \n\nOverall, not worth a full retail price.

The potential with this game is very high but I feel like the developers don't really see the problem and are trying to fix issues which aren't the main ones. I know the team has a lack of funding so I am a bigger supporter owning almost every DLC for the game. The new skill system is the first step in the right direction I have seen since the game came out. The next step for the developers is to make the game more arcade like and add cool but stupid features. Stuff like that is what makes Payday what it is. In payday 2 you could bring an explosive crossbow to a heist and dominate with it or you could use a giant spoon and kill cops with it. The point is the game is trying to be too \"realistic.\" The new skill system really helps because it makes not one build the best but it is up to the player to decide what they want to do. I think they should also expand on the overkill weapons because I feel those have a lot of potential as well. The next best way to make the game more \"arcade like\" is to add stupid but good and funny weapons and playstyles."}

If you can't afford the premium price of Battlefield 6; 2042 has the least amount of AI bots plaguing the multiplayer compared to Battlefield V and Battlefield 1. In addition, I recommend you get a free software to automatically clear RAM buildup every 30 minutes so you don't have to force close the game every 60 minutes. Otherwise, your game will crash from a large buildup of RAM cache. Reddit recommends ISLC but I use Wise Memory Optimizer. Some maps have large memory leaks, so you want to make sure you deal with that or else :/. Also I suggest you force Dx12 so that the game doesn't use Dx11, which is poorly optimized."}

This game can be played solo and with friends.\n\nIf you love MMO's and love Dungeon crawlers this game will definitely hit the spot and allow you to hit two birds with one stone with your time.\n\nEnjoy!"}

Worse than R6 and what i mean by that is you either get special ed teammates or you get griefers that spawn into a heist drop a Nuke and then insta leave so you cant report it honestly sucks the fun out atleast when i played Payday2 it wasnt as bad but this game all these retarded kids that spawn and drop the nuke on overkill diff on stealth just make this game not enjoyable. Me and my friends played this game and now im alone torturing myself because i dont want to just play with AI. Very rarely i get good teammates that arent dumb to the point that they run AWAY from the guard that busted them mf The guard is NOT special ed like you like damn <they kinda are btw> i have mf running away from the guard like hes gonna forget seing you mf use your brain Damn. So if you like being miserable play this game ill still be playing bc i got banned on R6 so i have no other game to play."}

Combat is smooth and flexible, letting you play your own style—stealth, hacking, or full-on gunfights. The RPG elements, upgrades, and choices give the game great replay value.\r\n\r\nAfter all the updates, Cyberpunk 2077 has become the game it was meant to be. If you love immersive open worlds, strong storytelling, and futuristic cyberpunk themes, this game is a must-play.\r\nAbsolutely love it. 10/10 experience. 🔥💙"}

Until the devs sit down and ask themselves what made Payday 2 so successful and actually bring that depth back, I can’t recommend this game. Maybe one day."}

It has the bones of being a proper successor to Payday 2, HOWEVER it lacks the massive hoard of content and character that Payday 2 has. The overall game feel is much more refined, FPS is massively improved, the graphics look *good*, the game doesn't crash. Overall what they've done is make what looks more like a proof of concept or a tech demo then an actual game compared to Payday 2.\n\nWe all knew that due to the massive buildup of DLC and drip feed content in Payday 2 it makes this game look tiny in comparison, but it makes things much harder to justify playing Payday 3 over 2.\n\nI'm only giving it a recommended rating because of the potential. There is a real chance that over time the game improves as more content is added, but right now I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it."}

Don't remember encountering many bugs, if any? Maybe some cyclist glitched at some point, which was funny.\n\nThere is something about the general feel of it, which makes it not feel a little off. It's not very noticeable, but if I think about it, it's there. I do think Rockstar should have taken much more care with this edition, though. I didn't play this for a long time, because I wanted to avoid the bugs. Sucks for the players who did encounter them.\n\nStill, I mostly just forget I'm playing a new version. I feel the same as I did, when I played it for the first time as a kid. And now if I try the original? Well, damn. I gotta admit, I maybe enjoy this more. Glad I have access to both, though.\n\nGonna try mods though to get all the songs back, as I heard not all the originals are there."}

It has variety of activities that feel like you really control a person, with food, gym and romance.\n\nThe story is the same as the original, can be considered deep and with political commentary done right.\nYou really connect with the protagonist and want him to succeed, something that I didn't feel for Claude in GTA III. Almost all the side characters are great and feel like the contribute to the story by a lot.\nIt truly feels like an open world game and not a product of its time.\n\nOne negative is that you need to find the optimal settings by trial and error and reading some guides about that."}

Personally, I think there are aspects that could help the game improve in future versions, such as further upgrading the gameplay, giving the story more freedom (of course, this will be difficult to develop because there are many situations that need to be handled), breathing life into the NPCs and the city to make them more vibrant and realistic, and better optimizing the game so that medium-sized machines can still play it. Currently, the game still has a few bugs, such as crashes in some situations that require exiting and restarting. I hope the developers will continue to improve the game further."}

Do I think it's as bad as people say no but it is indeed in every way worse then PD2 the only fun addition being social stealth. My personal problem is definitely the skills and weapons pistols are basically useless unless you DLC pistols the judge or one of the revolvers every other pistol is like tickling the enemies as for skills I have 3 builds a hip fire, a ads and a stealth build all stealth builds are basically the same a far cry from the amount of builds and play-styles I've had in PD2.

If you don't pay, you have to no life it to be even near the top.\nAnd I mean it, you have to watch your time, to know when in the day certain events take place, to log in and do them. Because they will allow you to do your dailies. If you don't have other plans, then sucks to be you, better organize some time for lost ark.\n\nAnd why do you have to grind? You grind to improve your gear (upgrading can ofc randomly fail, with high probability), because you are actually blocked from progressing in story unless you get better gear.\n\nThey periodically update earlier regions to ease the grind, but that is only so newer players don't get stuck on useless content that nobody plays anymore. It's still the same mindless grind at the last region, every day the same obligatory 2 bosses and same 2 dungeons.\n\nAnd the only way to look cool is to buy skins, that is a major sin of gaming for me."}

Only issues is the frame cap since I have a good PC and secondly the steam overly won't let me change it to PS5 overlays when playing. If those two issues were resolved the score would be flawless but given these small issues I give it a 4.8/5"}

Every game started to feel bland, boring, easy, and i just didn't really want to play video games anymore. BUT I DOWNLOADED THIS GAME. If you can get past the first 10 hours or so of learning the game and how everything works, what things do, this game became one of the most addicting things i have ever indulged in. I highly recomend both the game, and  using chat gpt when you get stuck somewhere. 8.5/10, would be close to a 10 if it was crossplay and had a multiplayer system where you can have a friend or two free roam together, would love to be able to run around, fight with/against my friend(s). IF YOUR ON THE FENCE ABOUT GETTING THIS GAME, DO IT. please consider :)"}

Between all the platforms I put nearly 1,400 hours into P2, and only got about 9 into this before I uninstalled it and walked away. For gods sake, they've gone ahead and made MAIN CHARACTERS from P2 into PAID DLC. \n\nCrying shame, I was so excited for this. I'm out."}

I left as someone more patient, more focused and far more humble.\nThis world does not hold your hand. It does not explain itself. And it certainly does not forgive mistakes. Every step feels dangerous, every victory feels earned. When you die, it never feels unfair it feels deserved.\nCombat is deep, precise, and punishing. Every enemy is a lesson. Every boss is a story. Every defeat is training. The music makes each encounter feel legendary, and the art direction turns suffering into beauty.\nELDEN RING rewards curiosity, punishes arrogance, and respects intelligent players.\nThere is no wasted time here even the struggle has meaning.\nAfter 100+ hours, I'm still discovering new paths, new secrets, and new reasons to keep playing.\nIf you're looking for a casual, easy experience stay away. But if you want a journey that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Rise, Tarnished. The throne awaits."}

The nostalgia factor is really strong, the map is quite large and there are lots of missions and things to collect.\n\nThe launcher was really unnecessary and why do I need it? Can't you save games locally anymore? It's a shame that it's going in this direction. Apart from the graphics, I couldn't really find any differences to the original version, and there is also a bug that bothered me:\n\n- The skill system, you hear that there's a change, but you don't see it. Sometimes it's displayed anyway, you get used to not knowing where you stand skill-wise.\n\nThe flight controls are also absolutely crap, I couldn't do the optional mission: \"Supply Lines...\" from Zero because the plane (or RC) just keeps wobbling around in the air, even with a controller there's no chance, I probably got 3 grey hairs more and unfortunately had to skip this mission. Maybe I'm too incompetent, but it was somehow easier in the original.\n\nThe best mission in my opinion was: \"Test Drive\", racing through the city with nitro, super smooth."}
