Between multiple accounts. I LOVED this game. Man when it came out i had such a blast. The combat, the map, the stuff you can do solo etc. was great! Even today the combat/raids felt amazing. best ive ever experienced. NOW the bad stuff, P2W is terrible! You can pay and get to the highest item level fast. You are also forced to do daily content if you want to keep up with people. You can take 3-5 days off and if you do, you are behind unless you pay to catch back up. Gems and farming in this game is NONSTOP. This could have been amazing...but corporate greed is what killed this game"}

I first played San Andreas years ago on my old computer and playing this Steam version was a nice trip back in time.\n\n100% completion took me a significant amount of time, mainly because the story itself is quite long. Don't know what else to add, just play the game, either you do it for the first time or just replaying your favorite game from the past - in any case it's definitely worth it (recommend buying it at a great discount)."}

First, i had some fun with the game. Was buggy (who would have guessed), sure, but ok. Now, after a pause i wanted to play it again. But i don't know what they did, it's now completely broken and won't even start anymore. It wants me to enable Secure Boot for my pc and also gives me a Side and Youtube-Link on how to do it. So i look it up, read the comments and people talk about how they get blackscreens etc from it. I already played nearly 100 Hours without the need to do such extra steps that potentially messes up my pc. \n\nWhy do i have to do such extra work for a not even properly finished game. That kinda ruined the hype i had for the upcomming Battlefield. \n\nDefinitely a no from me if that's the same case for BF6."}

I got it as a Battlefield package (1, 2042, 3, 4, 5, Hardline) before 6 dropped.  I have to say 2042 isn't all that bad.  Weapons are pretty good.  Bots  can be easy or difficult.  The maps range from small to large.  Sniping is pretty good.  The sound quality is great.  Not really a fan of buying \"skins\" for weapons or uniforms so I just avoid buying anything that requires \"real\" money.  You have to get an account with EA to play online (I think).  I don't really use the EA play app ; I find you don't need to log into it to play the game  just to register (?).  Any whos, it's pretty fun.  Some people have issues with online and MP however, I can't say I have had any problems thus far.  I recommend it."}

The game feels solid. gunplay is responsive and satisfying, perks and builds actually matter, and the heists (especially the newer ones) are fun and well-designed. It’s not perfect, but i’ve been having a good time with it so far. But, and this is a big one, it’s still always-online, even if you’re playing solo. No real offline mode, no way to launch a heist without being connected. This has been one of the most requested features since launch, and Starbreeze keeps sidestepping it with vague answers or silence. if your internet goes out? you’re out.\r\nJust want to play solo without worrying about servers? Too bad. It’s a shame, because the core game finally feels strong. But forcing players to always be online, especially for a game that’s so focused on solo and co-op PvE. Just feels unnecessary and restrictive."}

The most fun quest I had was collecting all the Dalaman cars, and mainly cause of an easter egg to a previous game that I loved. (no spoilers).\n\nSunning graphics, audio is mediocre at best, and the main storyline is ok. Some of the side quests are horrid and tourtous to complete.  \n\nOverall, not worth a full retail price.

Though it's not as bad if you ignore some of the game-breaking bugs.\r\n\r\nThe story here (without a doubt) is the best out of the trilogy.\r\nVisuals after the update are amazing and faithful to the original version on PS2, but there's still some things missing like the motion blur effect when going too fast.\r\nGameplay is the worst part of this game, especially because of the bugs present here. Tbf they're very minimal compared to how they were on release.\r\n\r\nStill a good way to experience this legendary game, you'll have plenty of fun."}

It has some amazing moments, like raids or story arcs or gameplay, that make it really shine, however it is definitely lacking in some areas. If you dont mind timed /grinding/ difficult content you'll probably enjoy the vast majority of the game, but the game really loses its charm once you start hitting content walls because your gear isn't high enough. There's a pay-to-win aspect as well that sours the good stuff the game has to offer. All in all, I'd recommend it to most MMO players, but I also wouldn't blame them for not enjoying it."}

I’ve been playing since Battlefield 2, and I’ve played all of them  except for Battlefield 5. I skipped that one because I didn’t like the beta and wasn’t going to pay for a game I knew I wouldn’t play.\n\nBut this one, Battlefield 2042, honestly… I played the beta, and it was terrible. I played for a month of EA’s subscription just to try it, and when the trial ended, I didn’t renew it because it simply wasn’t worth it. The game was incomplete at launch, the maps were bad, and there’s really not much to praise about it.\n\nSome people might like it, but as someone who’s played all the Battlefield games, there’s nothing here that stands out in a good way. I’ve got around 250 hours in it only because I bought it on sale for about 4 bucks, and I was grinding BF6 skins in Portal servers while AFK. That’s the truth.\n\nDon’t waste your time buying or playing this game. There are better ways to spend your time. If you want to play Battlefield, my opinion and just my opinion play Battlefield 6 or 4, or 3, or even Battlefield 1 if you like World War I settings. But this one, Battlefield 2042, really isn’t worth it."}

Sliding feels so dynamic and a nice, cool change from the usual shift-jump-crouch. The only complaint is this game is boring without friends and the damn Cloakers or whatever they are called after you enter hard mode; also the way the game sells an atrocious amount of DLC. This game isn't trash nor low effort, worth while it is on sale due to the DLCs. If the full game came without DLCs except maybe the licensed DLCs like Jacket and legacy heists that aren't apart of the overall story, it would be worth it at full price.\nExpanding on the annoying Cloakers, they won't at shoot you and prioritize kicking you down specifically if you play with AI, all you can do is watch your AI teammates run around trying to save you, and Cloakers are always present on the map no matter what, a normal heist will see you face 1 Cloaker per 10-15 seconds. Unless you play with friends you can't properly fight against Cloakers... and with the game having a bad reputation no casual player is willing to drop any money on the game unfortunately."}

It's a constant struggle for power. Everything is gatekept, and if you do not play all the time, you will fall behind. It's not something you can play casually. People constantly RMT, and the community is probably more toxic than WoW or even League of Legends. It's just not worth it.

Amazing game, terrible PC port. If you have a console, I strongly advise buying it elsewhere.

The game is locked to 60 fps and stutters here and there, no matter the graphic settings. Finally, the keybind options are quite restrictive so you typically settle for \"good enough\" over something optimal. Otherwise the actual gameplay and its awards speak for itself. If you purchase on steam, be prepare to mod the game or go insane dealing with the little annoyances."}

At First I didn't really enjoy it, maybe because it was so different from what I'd been used to, or maybe because I wasn't good. But once I continued to get a couple more hours in I started to like it. The gun play is smooth and fast, while also managing to feel semi realistic (unlike cod). If I had unlimited storage I would definitely continue to play even though I already own Battlefield 6. Even if Battlefield 6 is better game in almost every way, Battlefield 2042 is still a great game and an even better, cheap alternative."}

I actually enjoy the mix of maps that offer both open and closed concept fighting experiences. The guns also pack a punch and the more arcade style movement was a fun change of pace. It is not so fluid and the gunplay not so clicky to become something akin to COD given that the game still has weight to it. I think the game is over hated and I have had a lot of fun with it. At the same time the lack of a campaign and unintuitive way of unlocking guns can be a bit frustrating. At the moment though this is my favourite FPS multiplayer experience."}

Sure there are some valid complaints coming from real bf heads out there but man most of what I see is straight bitching. The game is a decent battlefield game. Not the best and not Hardline. \n\nMy experience is that I avoided this game for the majority of its life until after the BF6 beta. After I played the beta I wanted more BF. So the logical next option was this game and wouldn't ya know it, it was on sale for a whoppin' 3 bucks. I told my friends to get it and we been jammin ever since. Probly not gonna finish the battlepass for the BF6 shit but we've had fun and its been a great baseline if you will for what we can expect in BF6. \n\nFrom my perspective, this game is not terrible and does not deserve the hate that it gets, generally. I wouldn't pay full price but at any discount this is a decent shooter. Not that it matters much anyways since BF6 is right around the corner, but I wanted to say my piece."}

Now, in 2025, a couple years after 2.0 came out, the game is even better. I liked it back then, but now it feels like one of the best games of all time, easily on par with Witcher 3. It needed some time in the oven and now it's near perfect. \r\n\r\nI do recommend getting some mods for the character customization, that is this game's primary con for me, there just isn't enough customization options and some of them weirdly lock you to gendered things. Thankfully, there are mods to fix it, but I would still say the vanilla game is near perfect, and the modding scene is well supported by CDPR so it's pretty easy to install everything, even right in the middle of a playthrough. Speaking of playthroughs, im at 200+ hours on my second playthrough now, not including the first 50, and I think i'll finish the game around 300 hours total with everything done and seen (for the most part). I'll still have to do a third playthrough for the last lifepath :3 All this to say, this game is enormous and I love playing in this world"}

The improvements since then are noticeable and appreciated, but even with Starbreeze’s promising direction, Payday 3 still struggles with replayability as it gets dull after just a few runs. The maps feel like a jumble of reused assets rather than the creative playgrounds of PD1 and PD2. The new Delivery Charge heist does help by adding more RNG. But at the end of the day, it’s still just another warehouse heist.\n\nHosting options remain barebones. There’s no way to set infamy limits or properly shape your crew, so lobbies are a gamble. Even when I set a heist to Overkill, level 1 players can still join.\n\nHonestly, the only reason I came back to this game is cuz I had fun playing with friends and have a bit of hope that the franchise will return to its former glory. (I will surely regret it later)"}

Initially, the game fascinated me, and I played it non-stop for a year. However, over time, it became overwhelming with pay-to-win elements and gatekeeping. Learning the new raids became extra challenging. And here we are, the story and early leveling were enjoyable. The combat system was the most fun I've seen so far. However, the game evolving into its current state and the lack of various ways to earn gold are the reasons I've reached the end of the road. I had a lot of fun, but I don't think it would be the right choice for newcomers. You should have been there on launch day. Missing you LoA."}

Good for EA/DICE getting some goodwill back. How messed up is it that we're looking EA of all companies to save FPS games?\n\nAnyways, do not get this game. I don't know if it's an AMD issue or what but this game is constantly crashing. My friends have Nvidia and still suffer crashes but mine seem to be way more frequent. Blue screens, complete crashes, you name it and 2042 does it. Alt-tab? Crash. Watching a video on the side? Crash. It's embarrassing that a game and an anti-cheat is this unreliable. I hope it'll be more stable for BF6.\n\nBut outside of constant crashing, the game is also just not good. Open weapons feels wrong in a Battlefield game. That isn't to mention how abysmal the maps are. They are the worst part of the game. Want a map with a giant boat in the middle with sniper spots that have a complete 360 unobstructed view of the entire map and nothing else? This game has 2 maps like that. In fact, every map suffers from giant centerpiece and unobstructed sniper spot. It's terribly designed and there's only so much fun you can have on those maps."}

The Cyberpunk Sci-fi elements, aesthetics and lore are so detailed and well fleshed out. The story is so raw and gut wrenching, often times forcing us to make decisions that are morally grey. From the storytelling to the narrative Cyberpunk 2077 paints a picture of a world not to dissimilar from our own, one ran by corporate greed and corruption. A story where desperate people resort to crime in order to make end meet. A story where often times there are no happy endings. Lots of characters like Johnny Silverhand and V for example are so well written, and have deeply complex personalities and compelling motivations."}

I say in terms of open-world/sandbox games compared to the GTA series -- this lands in S-Tier for me. Great balance between aesthetics, missions and side-stories.

Stealth has actual challenge to it now which is nice, I'd say this is a step up from Payday 2 in a good number of ways, though there are many small things missing that I enjoyed from Payday 2.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing I see holding this game back is the need to find a lobby for private/solo matches. Why do I need to wait over a minute just to enter a private lobby? It also really irks me there isn't an animation for telling civilians to get on the floor for a lot of guns."}

Glad they felt the need to add a almost uncounterable vehicle to the game that is already often dominated by helicopters, because counterplay isnt the core of battlefield or anything. Glad the devs seem to be making better moves but they were beyond moronic with 2042. This dumb free pass event that has a bunch of reused assets has done nothing but remind how horrifically bad the devs can and will fuck up their games.

I bought the game semi-recently as it went on sale and played through every heist in the game on overkill, but after that, there's really nothing left to do. It's sad cause the game is nearly a year old now, and there's maybe like an additional 2 free heists that've been added. The heists themselves aren't really that fun either (hate the wifi circles), feeling really uninspired and slapped together. There's not really much build variety since perk derks are gone and the skills are kinda wack, so I got bored pretty quickly. I do admit, I had fun when playing it for the first time, but there's not enough content or variety to keep that fun going."}

I have watched the devs work and add to the game to make it a decent Battlefield game, they only promised 4 seasons, we got 7 with some mini ones, and a bonus Battlefield celebration season out of nowhere which was super cool, so thank you so much for all of that. Is it different from other Battlefields sure, did it lack a story mode yes (In which is really sad, the lore in the CODEX was super cool, and it's a shame all the lore and the story is reduced to that and seasons.) But at the end of the day, it's still a decent FPS. Movement and gunplay feel great, some maps were good, and the specialists were ok, different yes, but I didn't have a huge issue with them. But if you ask me if I regretted getting a physical PC copy for like $25, and then buying it on Steam for $5, I'll say no, not at all. I really had a great time with 2042, and I'm sure I always will."}

The nostalgia factor is really strong, the map is quite large and there are lots of missions and things to collect.\n\nThe launcher was really unnecessary and why do I need it? Can't you save games locally anymore? It's a shame that it's going in this direction. Apart from the graphics, I couldn't really find any differences to the original version, and there is also a bug that bothered me:\n\n- The skill system, you hear that there's a change, but you don't see it. Sometimes it's displayed anyway, you get used to not knowing where you stand skill-wise.\n\nThe flight controls are also absolutely crap, I couldn't do the optional mission: \"Supply Lines...\" from Zero because the plane (or RC) just keeps wobbling around in the air, even with a controller there's no chance, I probably got 3 grey hairs more and unfortunately had to skip this mission. Maybe I'm too incompetent, but it was somehow easier in the original.\n\nThe best mission in my opinion was: \"Test Drive\", racing through the city with nitro, super smooth."}

Additionally its giving some kind of fake feel of being undercovered and silent by running from camera to camera and from doors to doors. I dont get it. Instead of offering a fun experience of heist fps, it feels boring, repetetive and uninspired."}

There were still quite a few bugs I found during my playthrough but not all that frequent and they were more funny, like a car clipping into the floor or the auto drive deciding to ram the car into a wall.\n\nSolid game, pacing felt very slow but that might be because I did nearly every side mission.

This is one of the few games where the side content is just as good, and sometimes even better, than the main story.

With every heist being hosted on their servers rather than one of you in the lobby, the latency is incredibly bad. I have great internet here, I can play League, Overwatch 2, no problems whatsoever. Payday 3's servers on the other hand are so bad that you can be seen by a camera, back around a corner and still have the detection counter counting up for another second. \n\nThen the lasers in vents, like on First World Bank for example, or the lasers to the back area in First World Bank, they will look deactivated on your screen, but because of the latency they probably aren't. Their solo beta is a start to getting back to a more stable game like Payday 2, but a locally-hosted multiplayer, like Payday 2, will be so nice to get.\n\nIt's still an alright game, but it would be so much better to have crisp responses since everything is close timings in stealth."}

Just very boring.  Same vibes for so long and combat is very slow and uncreative.  Most areas are blocked off by enemies too overpowered for you to defeat, so you're kinda just stumbling around for which way you are actually allowed to go.  Most enemy encounters at least have like 5 enemies too, so the game ends up playing more like a stealth than action game.  No real interesting music, visuals are serviceable but everything kinda just feels dull and depressing and kinda generic.  I liked the messages and ghosts everywhere from other players, that was funny/helpful.  Only positive I can really give it.  Maybe some will say it gets better after \"x\" amount of hours but I feel like thats the excuse for so many rpgs to just not have a hook and be lazy about that."}

Peguei pra jogar sem muita expectativa e acabei me viciando fácil. Night City é simplesmente absurda de tão bonita e cheia de detalhes, dá vontade de sair andando sem fazer missão nenhuma só pra explorar. A ambientação cyberpunk é muito bem feita, tudo tem personalidade, desde os becos até os prédios gigantes cheios de neon\r\n\r\nA história me prendeu demais. As missões principais são muito boas e as secundárias surpreendem, várias parecem até missão principal de tão bem escritas. Os personagens são marcantes, principalmente o Johnny Silverhand, que acaba virando uma presença constante e bem interessante durante o jogo.\r\n\r\nO gameplay é bem livre. Dá pra jogar no stealth, sair hackeando tudo, ou meter o louco no tiroteio. Conforme você vai upando e colocando implantes, o personagem fica cada vez mais forte e divertido de jogar. A sensação de progressão é muito boa.\r\n\r\nHoje dá pra dizer que Cyberpunk 2077 finalmente virou o jogo que prometeram. Recomendo demais pra quem curte mundo aberto e uma história bem feita."}

Oh it's like a 2% chance to upgrade? well pony up some cash or keep grinding. It sucks that f2p is so held back but I understand it's the play model they're choosing. \n\nOverall it's a 5/10 great boss fights and fun mechs but the end game progression sucks. Perhaps it's changed but with POE2 out I don't see a reason to go back."}

The devs put the efforts into the characters and the world building and that seems to have earned them a dedicated community, including a modding community. But even with mods and patches, the game is still a bit unstable and you get things like textures and objects appearing in front of you or crashes. So far, I do enjoy playing this movie."}

And the fact that it's just a tad easier than other Souls games in terms of enemies and the generousity of checkpoints (bonfires, site of grace etc) just makes a bit less frustrating when dying. I feel like this game can be played many times over without getting bored. \r\nIt is however giving me seconds-long lag spikes every now and then, which I dont know where it comes from, whether it's poorly optimization for PC or something running in the background that sets it off. And the game keeps running while the spike happens (not like freeze/lag if GPU was throttling or something, seems more like packet loss spike) so it kind of catches up after a sec or two, so I dont think it's hardware related (1440p, 5700x3d, 32GB ram, rtx 3080). It's getting annoying and i've seen that this is a known issue, I just assumed they would have fixed it after 3-4 years.\r\nBut other than that, really awesome game."}

While the graphics and the FPS are a big improvement, there are a few bugs that downgrade the experience quite a bit.

If you have played the original extensively like I have you'll still enjoy it, but you'll find that it's FAR from perfect and most likely not better than the modded \r\n (big emphasis on modded) version of the non-trilogy version.

There is a lot of good ideas that could come to this game within the up-coming months giving us more content and more items to enjoy. I feel as if there is a small lack of content, but this isnt really the devs fault its more of the fact that they added all of their ideas to Payday 2. While a majority of their Ideas have been exhausted I feel that they could come up with more heists for us to complete Such as a Federal Law Enforcement building like FBI Or CIA. At the end of the day this game is amazing and I enjoy it a lot. Definitely has its upsides compared to Payday 2."}

And it's linked to some other random email that I have never seen in my life... So i contact rockstar, and they won't help me get it back because I can't prove I own the rockstar account... So i say okay... How do i prove i own it. They say, you have to tell us when you made the account, and when you linked your last account to it. But I don't have this info. This info is nowhere to be found. It's not in my email, or on my account page, etc... So I cant't provide this info and therefore they wont help me even though I have all the purchase receipts...

Night City feels alive in a way that is hard to explain. You are not just following a main quest. You are listening to conversations. Reading messages. Stumbling into side stories that feel personal and sometimes uncomfortable. The game rewards slowing down and paying attention more than rushing from objective to objective.\r\n\r\nI also love how open it all feels. You can get lost in the city without feeling like you are playing it wrong. Some nights you follow the story. Other times you just drive, explore, or take on a small job that turns into something bigger. The game is at its best when you let go of the need to complete everything and just exist in the world for a while."}

But everything else from the endless grind, the pay to win, and the frustrating boss designs packed with so many one shots you're far more likely to die from them than the actual damage they do make for an overall terrible game. The problems have just been getting worse over time as well, there's a reason the player base has dwindled so much. I want to love this game but I just can't."}

Imho it's not terrible, but not as good as original SA. There are some differencies I don't like, for example biking works differently, melee fighting is more 'modern' with lock in, but that makes it worse and Idk what it is, some missions seems much more easier than in original, but might be just a feeling. I'll personally stick with original SA, don't think I'm ever gonna touch this version. There are many more things I like more in original or are missing in the remaster, but the review would be too long."}

I know that on Steam, it becomes cool to hate on games that are hated on by others - whether to get rewards or whatever from others. Having seen the reviews for BF2042, I had very low expectations.\r\n\r\nBut, at $3, and with a Road to BF6 event for free, what was there to loose?\r\n\r\nSimply put, I had a lot of fun. I finished the BF6 event, and enjoyed my journey there. After years of patches, and content updates, and changes - the final state of BF2042 is actually a lot of fun. Honestly I enjoyed it more than BF1 or BFV - neither of which did I personally find enjoyable, especially BFV, which has nothing do with WWII.\r\n\r\nI especially like the option to just play against AI if you so choose. Sometimes you just want to sit back and relax, and playing against the AI is a great way to do that, especially with others.\r\n\r\nOn sale, I think there is tremendous value to this game. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. And thats from a BF player who has been here since day 1 that there was a BF."}
