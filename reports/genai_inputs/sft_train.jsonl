If you are not a god gamer with unlimited free time, you will never catch up to P2W whales.\n\nRaids are unforgiving with several different bosses. A single boss fight can take up to 20+ minutes to finish, but a mistake from player can wipe the whole raid even at the very end and reset the boss. \n\nThis can mean that even in weekly farm content it takes hours to kill a single boss. Random parties can be heavily impacted by gatekeeping, because no one wants to waste hours on old content.\n\nThere is absolutely no variation to weekly grind, you have to repeat same weekly dungeons and raids until new ones arrive.\nDeveloper Smilegate RPG keeps introducing new item types for players to sink/sacrifice more time into upgrading, which also includes a lot of RNG."}

It's been 2 years and 2 months since and I have played PAYDAY 2 more than PAYDAY 3 in this time frame.\n\nIt's undoubtably a polished game. More sparkly. More detailed. In it's aesthetic and graphical spark, the gameplay falters. It just feels like a PAYDAY wannabe instead of a new game. And that's very tragic, considering PAYDAY 1 was grounded, desaturated, oppressive, yet still comical in premise and execution, while PAYDAY 2 grew from the grounded and nitty gritty into an extremely absurd, batshit insane game with crack-cocaine laced gameplay.\n\nPAYDAY 3 has nothing to show for itself. If you want a great, fun heist game, pick up either PAYDAY 1 or 2. Not only will you find more players, you'll find a better time too."}

It can be stolen from you! I bought this on steam last year and I didn't play it or launch it for a month. Then when I went to eventually play it, it made me sign into the rockstar launcher. So I signed in as usual, and it says I own the game on my rockstar launcher, so that's good. But when I go to launch it on steam, it says, this game is owned by another account... And it's linked to some other random email that I have never seen in my life... So i contact rockstar, and they won't help me get it back because I can't prove I own the rockstar account... So i say okay... How do i prove i own it. They say, you have to tell us when you made the account, and when you linked your last account to it. But I don't have this info. This info is nowhere to be found. It's not in my email, or on my account page, etc... So I cant't provide this info and therefore they wont help me even though I have all the purchase receipts... They are pure evil scum. I will never buy another digital rock star game again. They have the worst support ever. External launchers are from Hell."}

This game aged well for me. I believe whether you are here for nostalgia or not. This game is worth it on sale. The story is good. The driving is good. \n\nTo be honest, the combat system, swimming and the A.I is bad for me. The main story direction is unclear for me. I find it tedious to go back and forth to research at youtube to be guided at the main story. It is so tedious to go back and forth for ammo, armor or weapons at the weapon store. The optimization is also bad, gta 5 runs better."}

Just hoping they can fix the game in the 2nd year of pd3.\nFor now? the game is worth it if you can get it on sale. For full price?

I'd been hearing that things are way better recently, so I picked it up again. For starters, the graphics are fantastic, night city really does feel like a real city, and it's clear a lot of effort went into making it so. The combat is fun and engaging, although it does slowly become too easy even at the hardest difficulty (if you engage in all the side content). Towards the end of the game I found myself breezing through main story battles and boss encounters with ease which did make them feel slightly anti climactic. \nNow to the main highlight of the game - the story. Fantastic plot lines all round, great voice acting across the board. The game does a great job at making you feel the weight of decisions you make not only in the main story but also in the side quests which is so rare. I found myself actually deliberating before making choices and feeling hurt or at best left with a bittersweet feeling at the end of most quests.\nWould wholeheartedly recommend this game."}

I gave it a try for five hours to give the game what I felt was a fair shake.  After five hours and having sat through the quite lengthy Interlude, I decided this wasn't for me and subsequently learned that Steam has a two hour maximum play time for a refund.  That's a silly restriction for a game like this.  In five hours I felt like I hardly did anything.  Well I attempted to refund it twice but Steam says no.\r\n\r\nWhat put me off?  It felt more like an interactive story.  I was mostly a passenger for those five hours.  The driving on a keyboard was not good at all.  The game was quite dark, making it hard for me to figure out what was going on in combat.\r\n\r\nBottom line, it just wasn't for me for a number of reasons.  And now I'm stuck with it.   If you decide to try it, make sure you know that you only have two hours of story time before you're locked in to your purchase.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I went in with Steam recommendations and having read other mentions of it being an open world game but I never got that far."}

While the launch was legendary for the wrong reasons, the game I’m playing now is a masterclass in atmosphere, storytelling, and \"style over substance\" (though there’s plenty of substance here too). Night City is easily the most detailed urban environment ever put in a game. At 25 hours, I’ve stopped using fast travel. I’d rather drive my Kusanagi bike through Japantown at night, watching the neon reflect off the wet asphalt. Every district—from the corporate glitz of City Center to the rusted decay of Pacifica—feels distinct and lived-in.\n\nFinal Thought: If you’re looking for a digital playground that respects your time and offers a dark, mature story, Night City is calling. Just don't expect a happy ending—this is Cyberpunk, after all.\n\nScore: 10/10 — Come for the neon, stay for the soul-crushing existential dread."}

If you don't, you have to sail, \nwhich is insanely boring and another obvious timegate to encourage microtransactions.\n\nAnd last but not least RNG GEAR UPGRADING: The biggest offender of them all that people have reported spending thousands of dollars on. This is the core reason why the game is P2W, and it's a blatant scam.\n\nThis is absolutely my #1 biggest gaming disappointment. All I wanted was to play an MMO with engaging combat, but it simply had to be ruined by a greedy business model.

The maps are dogshit TTK is 0.5 seconds classes are the most boring shit on the planet earth. This is as far away from battlefield games as you can get. I HAVE to give credit where its due tho : The free battlepass to hype you up for bf6 is the most genius shit i've seen in gaming EVER. The challanges are made to keep you in game for as long as they can. Challanges for specific weapons were picked to make sure those are the most dogshit weapons you can find so it takes you longer to get it . HORRIBLY specific shit like killing 2 people with torch. Don't get me wrong I love me a good torch kill. but it's supposed to be one of those rare kills you get and ur hype about it , when the game FORCES you to go out there and throw away the fun of it is gone and feels like ur the one getting slowly torched in real life rather than a fun experience. Whoever came up with all those challanges THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. Because of you I will NEVER In history of EVER want to play this dogshit game ever again."}

Hero balance is non-existent. heroes hard counter each-other. Games are decided in hero select.\r\n6.    Somehow even a more toxic community.\r\n7.

The game puts you in a position where to play effectively, you need multiple characters.\n\nImagine doing the same thing over and over with several characters throughout the day. You can also purchase materials for gear upgrades with real currency, and the costs of upgrading are high, with a lot of RNG involved. The mechanics of this game don't make sense; it's a waste of time unless you enjoy doing repetitive tasks day in and day out on multiple characters and occasionally splurging real cash on materials that might improve your gear.\n\nI definitely do not recommend it, even though the gameplay itself, the dungeons, and the combat feeling are decent... but how long can you keep doing the same, mundane things over and over again? :)"}

I actually enjoy the mix of maps that offer both open and closed concept fighting experiences. The guns also pack a punch and the more arcade style movement was a fun change of pace. It is not so fluid and the gunplay not so clicky to become something akin to COD given that the game still has weight to it. I think the game is over hated and I have had a lot of fun with it. At the same time the lack of a campaign and unintuitive way of unlocking guns can be a bit frustrating. At the moment though this is my favourite FPS multiplayer experience."}

Consolidating the first two tiers makes upgrading new characters extremely quick. They've taken out a lot of the things that made the game feel grindy and added in more quality of life. Many of the things I hated about the game at launch have all been tweaked in some way. If anyone is looking to give this game a go again then you should now that the newest update is live. It's not perfect but this game caters to the western audience way more now than what it did on launch back in 2021."}

The game feels solid. gunplay is responsive and satisfying, perks and builds actually matter, and the heists (especially the newer ones) are fun and well-designed. It’s not perfect, but i’ve been having a good time with it so far. But, and this is a big one, it’s still always-online, even if you’re playing solo. No real offline mode, no way to launch a heist without being connected. This has been one of the most requested features since launch, and Starbreeze keeps sidestepping it with vague answers or silence. if your internet goes out? you’re out.\r\nJust want to play solo without worrying about servers? Too bad. It’s a shame, because the core game finally feels strong. But forcing players to always be online, especially for a game that’s so focused on solo and co-op PvE. Just feels unnecessary and restrictive."}

This new version comes with Quality of life features just like an instant restart mission option if you fail, better aiming, better minimap and graphical options up to date. There is also the option to play with the original PS2 color palette. The story is about the murder of the MC's mother, the war between gangs and corrupt policemen. All the cars, boats, helicopters and even planes feel great to drive. There are guns for each situation and you can get better at using. I had a blast with this one and finished it in around 19 hours so if you like open worlds, driving, shooting and crime stories just get it.\n[h1]9/10[/h1]"}

A lot of bugged textures, random tire textures on the road, objects when broken phasing through the ground, objects with no collision, and many more. \n\nThere is one that when I am walking to the right or left CJ will start teleporting, when swimming too, and a bug with the new \"classic lighting\" that makes the dirt smoke when you drive in offroad green and really big, you almost can't see your car, and these are what I found in less than a hour of gameplay. \n\nIf you're thinking about buying it, keep in mind that it still is a buggy mess, and we don't know if they're gonna fix it or not, or how long it will take. Buy it at your own risk"}

The powerpass and progression system are really aim for existing players to get more alts and stick more time into the game. New players get lured into the game, complete the pass, try to do anything end-game related and get instant gatekept. Though community may have something to be blamed, it really comes to the devs and the way they keep designing the game to be more sweaty and only for those who are into that endless grind."}

If you are looking for a tactical shooter that accurately simulates real-world combat, this is not your game. If you are looking for fun, massive scale battles where you can blow people up with pretty much everything, this is your game. The scale is  great, the weapon and vehicle selection is the best I’ve seen in a battlefield game, and the gameplay loop is great in the core modes. Overall, I’d recommend this game to anyone looking for a dumb, fun shooter. As a completionist, however, this game is a nightmare. Many of the trophies are unnecessarily difficult, requiring hours of grinding, or even the multiple trophies in the extraction gamemode that are borderline impossible, on account of the fact that the lobbies don’t fill and the ones that do are full of cheaters.

Not an issue for most, but it does negate the \"free to play\" game status.\nI played through to level 16 naturally (no passes) and it was miserable. The story is terrible, the nomenclature is even worse. The quests are absolutely boring, likely the most boring I've ever experienced. Battle lag is unbearable at peak gaming times.

The game should be released in the state it is in now. Starbreeze rushed WAAAAAY to much and released a sh♥t game and broke their reputation probably forever. However, after 2 years I really enjoyed the game, and this is coming from a person that was very disappointed after getting the most expensive pre order. I still am sad that I bought it, because I feel like this many heists, weapons etc. should be in the release version of the game, and not after 2 years, but it's better than nothing, right? \n\nI spent over 2000 hours in PD2, and I must tell you, this game is more like Payday The Heist, than Payday 2. No more running and dodging, no more overpowered weapons, you need to play it very slow and very tactical. The enemies are really tough and sometimes scary.

Honestly i thought the definitive edition even after updates will be still a weird, unplayable and a mess just like in release day, but with that classic lighting (like from PS2), and fixed bugs (still i met some bugs but they weren't so annoying) that game comparing to OG version which of course was my childhood is still alright (not perfect like original but still ok).\n\nThe cons of that version which i experienced are planes/helicopters, that game forces you to control a plane with a mouse with holding a left mouse click. With flying vehicles i'll recommend to use a controller, because FOR ME, controlling a plane with a mouse was for me very uncomfortable and unplayable, i was get used to with number keyboard like from OG version.\n\nBtw i have definitive edition by buying GTA+, because i can't imagine buying that game for a higher price. But after that, is still a fun game even with that \"cartoonish\" graphics."}

I cannot comment to how severe they actually were broken as I bought this game way after its launch. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is the easiest and most accessible port of San Andreas, and it runs well for what it is. It brings a lot of quality of life improvements the game needed to bring it into a modern format for a newer audience. \r\n\r\nLegacy fans will stick by the original port of San Andreas for good reason, the modding scene for the TDE is non-existent which takes a lot away from the replay value and also effects how much time a player will spend on this version of the game once beating the story and 100% list.\r\n\r\nBut, if you are looking to play a more refined port of the San Andreas base game for casual reasons, this game will more than likely satisfy you."}

Like or love the creative choices Dice made with 2042, they had a vision and direction for this game and it showed. Not without its flaws, a very long way from the likes of BF2 and BF4 but a decent Battlefield game nonetheless.\n\nI gave up on the game during its launch period but frankly I enjoyed playing 2042 in the lead up to the release of BF6 much more than anticipated. In fact I'd go as far to say I found this game more enjoyable and more close to a proper Battlefield game than BF6.\n\n2042 got a bad rap, it was mostly deserved, until it wasn't, because it turned out ok in the end."}

Behind the flashy visuals is a dead world filled with lifeless, brain-dead NPCs that barely react to the player. Night City looks impressive, but it’s nothing more than a pretty shell with no depth, no emotion, and no reason to care.\n\nThe shooting is the only thing that feels decent. The weapons are fun, sure, but one good system can’t carry an entire game. Missions are repetitive, forgettable, and your playstyle is meaningless. Aggressive, stealth, it doesn’t matter the game plays the same every time.\n\nThe AI is laughably bad and constantly ruins immersion. Bugs and jank are still everywhere, animations feel outdated, and NPC behavior feels straight out of an unfinished early build. Calling this game “fixed” is a joke.\n\nI don’t understand the praise this game gets. It fails as an open-world RPG and barely works as an action game. I won’t waste any more time on it, and I strongly do not recommend it."}

The new population of players are the FPS equivalent of midwits and are extremely unfun to play against. Players are certainly more competent or aware on average than they were a decade ago, which one may think would lead to better match quality, but they are also more exploitative of the game's poorly designed mechanics and systems, and they speedrun matches so they can get back to the loading screen ASAP. you rarely see players who actually like TF2 for what makes it special and try to achieve mastery of mechanics and instead see a flood of people basically cheesing games to get petty \"victories\" and achieve the fleeting ecstasy that only a subtard could feel upon being told that they \"won\""}

The game is clearly not designed for a single player and it makes trying to do stealth heists alone a nightmare. in fact stealth has become extremely unintuitive in general it took me a while to realize there's no \"conceal\" stat anymore. At least not one visible in the loadout menu... \n\nThe gunplay is pretty good but the game just throws cloakers at you every 10 seconds for some reason. And there's almost no weapon variety compared to the original. After my first heist I literally couldn't find things to spend money on besides a mask, as most weapons are either DLC locked, high level locked, or bought with a premium currency I can't afford. 5 of let alone 50. [EDIT: I forgot to mention that the default bank heist literally destroys money if you don't disable the packs fast enough, which you can't do by yourself. So you must play with more people or you literally cannot get the same rewards no matter how skilled you are]\n\nJust get payday 2. This is like if call of duty had a heist mode that emulated payday 2."}

I got one of my great friends into the genre just by getting him this game. (He sucked at it so much :).) The story is your average FromSoftware story, where it is confusing as hell sometimes. Haven't tried the DLC yet, so I am looking forward to hell that they produce. Anyone can enjoy this game as long as they put the time and effort into learning the bosses. Overall, I give this game a 10/10, very fun while being challenging. Farewell fellow Tarnished"}

There is a lot of good ideas that could come to this game within the up-coming months giving us more content and more items to enjoy. I feel as if there is a small lack of content, but this isnt really the devs fault its more of the fact that they added all of their ideas to Payday 2. While a majority of their Ideas have been exhausted I feel that they could come up with more heists for us to complete Such as a Federal Law Enforcement building like FBI Or CIA. At the end of the day this game is amazing and I enjoy it a lot. Definitely has its upsides compared to Payday 2."}

The gunplay feels great, the mechanics are tight, and there’s a reason this franchise has stayed popular for so many years. When matches are clean, CS2 delivers some of the most intense and rewarding competitive gameplay out there.\n\nThat said, Premier mode at higher elo (+20k) currently has a serious hacker problem. It really hurts the experience when you’re trying to play competitively and fairly, and it can be frustrating to lose games to obvious cheating rather than skill.\n\nIf you want a more serious and enjoyable competitive experience, Faceit is highly recommended. The players are generally more committed, the level is higher, and the anti-cheat makes a big difference.\n\nOverall, despite its issues, CS2 is still a fantastic game with huge potential. With better anti-cheat support in Premier, it could easily be one of the best competitive shooters on the market again.\n\nRecommended – but competitive players should consider Faceit."}

Some of the negative feedback that I saw in the reviews mentioned gatekeeping of raids and a pay-to-win (P2W) system, so let me share my perspective on them.\n\nGatekeeping of raids: If you join an active guild and put in the effort to find the right people to play with, they will raid with any class you have. If you prefer not to be friends with other gamers, you can create your own raid lobby and label it accordingly, such as 'learning party' if you are just starting out or 'hw party' if you are well-experienced. You might be surprised by how many people are waiting to join you.\n\nP2W: Frequent events, shops, and daily prizes provide a good amount for you to level up. While it might take a while, the progression is meant to be more like a 'stroll in the park.'

Gunplay is so good. Like very good. \n\nOptimization is actually good. Doesnt crashes like pd2 did.\n\nNow there is bad things too, servers are bad. \nThere is little content and not replayable.

However, I bought it on sale and I suggest you do it too.\r\n\r\nI like the gunplay and weapons in the game. They are really satisfying to use and have a nice feel to them. Many favorites too choose from. The graphics are decent and the effects plays to the sense of chaos when going loud on heists (guns blazing). Going stealth can be very exilirating as well. Also, a decent variety of enemy types and a badass soundtrack makes it easy to recommend this game. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are some caveats to be aware off. Mainly, the lack of content (although it is getting better) and a poorly designed skilltree (they recently fixed the armour system). In summary, the game is fun but feels in the end a bit unfinished. Hopefully the developers will continue supporting the game with more content and improvements. As I understand it the game is a lot better now than 12 months ago."}

Grass can sometimes be floating. Animations can be very janky at 240fps, but I've had zero performance issues so far at 120fps. Most remastered NPC's look fine, but the fugly ones you may have seen in memes are still very fugly. \n\nOverall this is been a great way to play the game.

Next day, again not launching, no error. I tried every single thing imaginable and posted on EA forums to fix it. Finally, reinstalling the anti-cheat and running it as admin fixed. Next day, again not launching. This is absolutely unacceptable for a game that launched 4 years ago and there are forums with these same issues dating back 3 years. EA is a terrible company."}

The story at times is super slow and I almost gave up, but once you reach the DLC content (which you should totally buy) the game redeems itself. The pace is not the reason I said it’s hard to recommend - it’s the fact that 5 years after release, the game is unoptimized and bug ridden. Main quests being stuck and needing to load from older saves, crashes for no apparent reason, minor yet annoying bugs all over the place. \n\nIn the end it is a unique piece of art that I can’t not recommend, but this could’ve been a masterpiece and a GOAT."}

It's a cheap attempt at gaming that pales in comparison to its more creative counterparts, leaving players yearning for a more engaging and original experience.

Mostly intact, but yeah… some classics are gone due to licensing, which sucks. Still, the radio stations are great and totally set the vibe.\n\nAt the end of the day, I had fun. It's not the “definitive” version Rockstar promised, but if you’ve got love for San Andreas and can forgive some jank, it’s worth diving in. Just know what you’re getting: a slightly modernized classic with a few cracks showing."}

You will feel useless and unable to really to anything noteworthy for your team, assuming you can leave spawn without dying.\r\n\r\nI now understand why this game was plagued with bots way back when. It's an old game. Maybe it's time to move on."}

For a game that came out when it did, the world still feels alive and impressive, and it honestly looked amazing for its time. San Andreas was way ahead of the curve, not just in graphics, but in how much freedom it gave players to really live in that world. It set the standard for open-world games, and even today.

Your bicycle can easily move cars, if you have head on collision with a car on a motorbike, huge chance the car will pinball away from you. Light is terrible. Models look like they were clay, necks sometimes are like 30% of the whole model. Nothing about this brings back nostalgia of original san adreas. So sad.

Good for EA/DICE getting some goodwill back. How messed up is it that we're looking EA of all companies to save FPS games?\n\nAnyways, do not get this game. I don't know if it's an AMD issue or what but this game is constantly crashing. My friends have Nvidia and still suffer crashes but mine seem to be way more frequent. Blue screens, complete crashes, you name it and 2042 does it. Alt-tab? Crash. Watching a video on the side? Crash. It's embarrassing that a game and an anti-cheat is this unreliable. I hope it'll be more stable for BF6.\n\nBut outside of constant crashing, the game is also just not good. Open weapons feels wrong in a Battlefield game. That isn't to mention how abysmal the maps are. They are the worst part of the game. Want a map with a giant boat in the middle with sniper spots that have a complete 360 unobstructed view of the entire map and nothing else? This game has 2 maps like that. In fact, every map suffers from giant centerpiece and unobstructed sniper spot. It's terribly designed and there's only so much fun you can have on those maps."}

I played it at launch on console and can't remember much about it. Recently bought it and I'm really enjoying it. Works fine on my steam deck which I use for work. The WiFi at work is terrible so the solo mode beta is the only way I've played it thus far and I'm enjoying that too. No other players. Just mindless bots that do nothing until it kicks off. How I like it. That been said, I'm looking forward to trying the online mode when I've got some time off for once. Strongly recommend this game. Carries the same amount of fun I loved so much about the first 2."}

Pure hypocrisy. \n\nNewbies, stay away from this game. Only reason people don't quit this game is because they've invested way too much into it already."}

Somehow I get banned for 2 hours, but the guy who feeds, trolls, and insults nonstop gets nothing.\r\nThere is zero logic or fairness in the punishment system.

It's also a shame that they have now gone back on their word and do not plan to add an offline mode to the game despite the fact that it struggles to even have a real player count at the moment. For the time that I tried playing I either could not find lobbies, was stuck in hell getting kicked for being new or trying to find lobbies without people just leaving constantly, or I was playing with what felt like bots.

I am a huge Battlefield fan, and when the game was first released it was super buggy and glitchy. \n\nBut now ( 10/2/2025) honestly, it was not too bad of a game. Some of the map designs were silly, but that is over shadowed by the immense playablilty of this game. From conquest to rush, from tank to air superioirty, to hardcore, softcore, and even to hazard zone: there are so many game modes to play! \n\nI was a fun experience going from Battlefield 2042 to 1942 to Bf2 and so many classic maps that have been redesigned to be in the frostbite engine. I am waiting until BF6 comes out, but this is not a bad option to play until then. \n\nOnly downside is there is no single player. But tons of Co-op and 4 man squad gameplay to run! \n\nI recommend playing this game."}

Though i will criticize one thing, the stealth. I'm not sure if i'm blinded by Payday 2 or if i'm genuinely retarded, but i can't for the life of me finish stealth, atleast never solo. For about 15 hours of the playtime i have now, i haven't been able to complete one stealth heist solo, not one. Not once have i managed to finish a heist stealth from start to finish and i'm starting to feel like it might be bad level design or some form of game design. The randomness of the guards and civilians throw me off like crazy. There were a couple of times i'd ALMOST gone through an entire heist, like on Dirty Ice, all i had to do was bag 5 clean jewelry and yet i still managed to fuck that up. I tried to time my getaway as perfectly as possible, but i guess the guards had enough of their normal cycle and decided to move back and forth between two points instead of circling around like they should. For me atleast, full stealth is actually impossible, i can't understand why i'm so bad compared to the 2nd game."}

Awesome. Problem? Faces horrible neglect while also being pretty complex + lacks a tutorial. Despite the positive reviews, the state the game is in right now is not great, not to mention the matchmaking system. Choosing maps that aren't popular in the rotation will result in long queue times and even if you do end up in a match, good chance it'll be unbalanced or half-empty. Still, the game offers a lot of variety and can be satisfying sometimes but it needs some qol improvements.

The characters look very plastic, and the environment is overly bright (which was corrected in the latest patch, first released on Netflix, then much later on Steam, by the way).\n\nWe also regret that the atmosphere of the original games was not faithfully recreated.\n\nSo, who should be blamed? Rockstar for delegating to Grove Street Games, or the latter for not putting more effort into their work?\n\nAnyway, there are still plenty of issues to fix. That said, playing the games is still possible, but you should approach them with caution if you're playing for specific reasons."}

While I managed to put in around 70 hours and had some fun, it was impossible to ignore how disappointing it felt. For a franchise that’s so close to my heart, it was clear that the game lacked many of the qualities that made earlier entries shine.\n\nRecently, I decided to reinstall it thanks to a discount and some unlocks for BF6. To my surprise, much has been improved, and I ended up sinking another 60 hours into it.\n\nThe game still feels a little soulless and generic at times, but there’s definitely fun to be had. One of my favorite aspects is the sense of scale that comes with 128 player Conquest. The addition of weekly missions pushes me to experiment with different weapons and tactics, which keeps things fresh. Text and voice chat have finally been added, and some genuinely great maps too. Plus, the cringey voice lines? Gone.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nLaunch: 6/10\n\nNow: 7.5/10\n\nI’m cautiously optimistic about Battlefield 6, but I can only hope EA doesn’t crush those dreams—as they’ve done before"}

But I still find myself incredibly attached and involved. TF2 is the kind of game that doesn’t need updates to live on, and is instead propelled forward by the community around it. This game has a lot of fight in it and an even bigger army of fans behind it. I hope to see it prosper on now and in the far future.\n\nLove you all, and thanks for all the summer crates."}

If that's enough to make you not want to get into it, then don't. Armor 2.0 added some variety to build-making, and I hope skills 2.0 can bring it home. The soundtrack still slaps.

You feel some bowel movements and it seems that you will release some gases? Well, the server needs to prepare, so... you know... server slowdown. A potato is a better server than the ones they have!

After what starbreeze blessed us with PD2 we should give them some credit.Dont listen to the negative feedback this game is getting right now.What i like about starbreeze is that they're committed to their fans unlike these greedy  studios ( EA canceled a dead space 2 remake because the recent one only sold 4.9 million copies!? ) I've been playing PD2 since 2013 on my old 360/xboxone im still blown away by the updates and attention to detail currently on PC. if you bought the game just buy a DLC here or there to help them ( im broke too but $7.99 for heist is not gonna kill you ) remember PD3 cant reach get to the level of PD2 if we let starbreeze sink. I currently give it a 6/10. If you reading this that means you care about PD3 like i do so grab it when on sale.\n\n\nOne more thing at least the gameplay is not a stale as these other games ......"}

Still, I’d recommend playing the originals with mods if you want the true experience. For fans and newcomers who don’t mind some rough edges, this is a great way to experience a legendary game."}

Operatives in 2042 dont change anything, they are just set of perks behind character, and those perks make game more variable and interesting. In 6 there are also perks but without characters. Same weapons for all but better for some classes, and even similar perks (like syringe or repair tool). 2042 do well at evening shooter to spend some time."}

It must really suck to be a new player, when you have no idea what to do and picking a expensive class. From personal experience, I have seen groups of 4-5 player that will invite a new player with bad gear. Just to make insult them but telling them to not play the game. (Which is good advice with bad intentions). Fun game but lackluster player economy to drive more player and keep them playing. Good luck to all my guildmates, was fun."}

Almost a month ago i decided to finally complete what i started back then and began doing the story. I decided i wanted to 100% the game and get the blue ribbon. Little did I know how much stuff i had to do outside of completing the main story to achieve full completion. The game has a shocking amount of content for a 20 year old game. If you are not in a hurry I think the game has around 100 hundred hours of content which i find great. GTA San Andreas has a special place in my heart and will always be in the list of my favorite video games. 10/10 Would Recommend!"}

With every heist being hosted on their servers rather than one of you in the lobby, the latency is incredibly bad. I have great internet here, I can play League, Overwatch 2, no problems whatsoever. Payday 3's servers on the other hand are so bad that you can be seen by a camera, back around a corner and still have the detection counter counting up for another second. \n\nThen the lasers in vents, like on First World Bank for example, or the lasers to the back area in First World Bank, they will look deactivated on your screen, but because of the latency they probably aren't. Their solo beta is a start to getting back to a more stable game like Payday 2, but a locally-hosted multiplayer, like Payday 2, will be so nice to get.\n\nIt's still an alright game, but it would be so much better to have crisp responses since everything is close timings in stealth."}

Go for it! I put a lot of time and effort into this game and I loved every moment of it. Once you finish all the raids, make all the alts, and teach a few fights here and there, it becomes tedious. The amount of homework to stay afloat and current with content takes a lot more time than I'd like, but they make all of the older content a lot easier to reach.\n\nThere's a lot of good fun that can be had with this game if you're into MMO's. The combat was a ton of fun, and the class diversity made for different experiences with each fight, but the gatekeeping to get into raids, the time it takes to try and get to new content (honing costs) are just wild if you don't have multiple characters to get gold from."}

It is one of my favourite games ever, easily in my top 5, maybe even top 3. I even remember once letting my dad try it, he got into a car and started stopping at every pedestrian crossing and patiently waited for the green light at traffic lights, which still makes me laugh when I think about it. I am not really a fan of this Definitive Edition, I think with mods the original game could look and play much better, but it was still fun to see all the old bugs and mechanics again. I bought it here and immediately tried to speedrun it because I watched a lot of Hugo One streams, he beats it in about 4 hours, my first run took around 20. Still, it was a cool experience and if I decide to speedrun it again I am sure it will be faster. Whatever you think about this version, San Andreas is a game for the ages."}

The updates have ironed out most of the launch hiccups, making it a much smoother experience. The storyline is as gripping as ever. CJ’s journey through betrayal, family, and redemption still hits hard. The game mechanics, like the driving and shooting, feel tight and satisfying, while the RPG elements add that extra layer of depth I love. The grove street vibes are still iconic, and the visuals feel refreshed without losing that classic San Andreas charm. It’s not flawless, but it’s a solid ride for anyone craving that nostalgic open-world chaos!"}

Old PvE content is dead, can't even get a few people together unless you're on a Discord server specifically for that stuff. Raids are gatekept as hell. It's to such a level that no other MMORPG even comes close. Speaking of raids, if you even think of joining one. You gotta find training groups and spend hours studying each raid because progression is tied to materials only dropped from Raid Bosses. Overall, this game is more like a full-time job than a game you play for enjoyment. \nIf you hate yourself and have nothing to do during 8h a day, I heavily recommend this game. As for me, i'll probably not be touching this again."}

I liked the little cameras we can throw anywhere and being able to check them. I also liked how we can grab civilians alive and move with them for stealth. That's about where it ends. I pre-ordered the gold deluxe edition or whatever that was around $100 and I feel like I definitely got scammed. With the always online Bullcrap I wasn't even able to access the game. I should've returned the game instantly because server issues took so long to fix that I wasn't able to return the game due to Steam's return policy. Despite being Payday 3, it is missing a lot of fun features that Payday 2 had. Customization is severely lacking like with melee, masks, guns, characters, loadouts, and much more. Money feels useless and the tasks to level up is an atrocious feature. All in all, Payday 3 does not even hold a candle to Payday 2. These clowns should give up on this dead game. L game.

But, that's okay. The game launched in a very rough state and still has some issues. However, the team behind Payday 3 has shown continued support to improve the core gameplay. Armor 2.0, Skills 2.0, and new heists that build on the gameplay loop continue to be released. Don't get me wrong, the game still has plenty of issues. There are only a handle full of masks and mask customization options, and there feels like a lack in variety of guns. Overall I think this game has the potential to be fantastic if given the opportunity."}

The improvements since then are noticeable and appreciated, but even with Starbreeze’s promising direction, Payday 3 still struggles with replayability as it gets dull after just a few runs. The maps feel like a jumble of reused assets rather than the creative playgrounds of PD1 and PD2. The new Delivery Charge heist does help by adding more RNG. But at the end of the day, it’s still just another warehouse heist.\n\nHosting options remain barebones. There’s no way to set infamy limits or properly shape your crew, so lobbies are a gamble. Even when I set a heist to Overkill, level 1 players can still join.\n\nHonestly, the only reason I came back to this game is cuz I had fun playing with friends and have a bit of hope that the franchise will return to its former glory. (I will surely regret it later)"}

So much love has been put into creating a world for these characters, the lore, cinematics, map visual cues.. real shame all that is now burried under this rug made of bright nonsensical cosmetics and terrible update decisions bloated with maps, taunts and cosmetics that frankly just don't fit the game..\n\nBut despite all the issues current TF2 has, i think the game offers you more than i had hoped so when i started playing. The random social interactions with strangers only using voice commands, chat or just even taunts is something you will truly not get in any other game. Genuinely"}

Be prepared to have level 1s and 5s join a max difficulty (Overkill) heist  and completely f- up all your your work due to barely understanding the game.\nEvery night is Amateur night in PD3 and only ones having fun is the one's ruining it for everyone."}

It is a stellar reshuffle of classic gameplay tropes. Lovely atmosphere, lovely characters, dreadful enemies, I would love to have some more variety in terms of gear looks but I appreciate the focus on quality and meaningfulness than pointless quantity and random trash. On the downside, the UI could be more intuitive, and fluid and a lot of farming is involved. Fun, but farming none the less. It is not as hard as they say. If it is hard, you are playing it wrong :P You are not a hero in this game. There is no glory, no big rewards and shining armor. No hand holding. Need to farm that XP hard. Buy your levels up.

Counter-Strike 2 stripped a lot of that away.\n\nThe game looks better, but it plays worse. Sub-tick was sold as an upgrade, yet gunfights feel inconsistent, movement feels floaty, and spraying is less predictable. The tight, learnable mechanics that made CS great are gone, replaced with a game that feels random instead of skill-driven.\n\nThe player experience is even worse. Matchmaking is flooded with clueless, zero-fundamentals players who don’t know smokes, rotations, or basic economy. Teamplay barely exists. Ranks feel meaningless when every match is a coin flip between people who grind the game and people who treat it like deathmatch.\n\nValve didn’t modernize Counter-Strike — they diluted it. Instead of a high-skill competitive shooter, we got a prettier game that caters to chaos and inconsistency."}

I played the game for the past 8-9 weeks with all the catch up events. But as soon as u get out of the catch up event because your ilvl is too high you can feel it instantly. the game is against the player, anything you do is against your odds. you respectably need 6 characters on a somewhat decent ilvl to do raids to earn gold (or purchase with real money) to funnel it into your main. but then you run out of mats, and out of silver, and out of shards and catching up on dps is not possbile because when you start fresh or come back to the game you only have that many cards you can use to increase your dmg. theres even passive bonus dmg against specific enemies (demons, humans, etc) that also is factored in. This game is honestly not worth your time and it definitely doesn't respect anyones time because you are locked in if you play. Don't fall for it."}

It's still kinda buggy, the armor system sucks, I dislike the lack of an infamy system, and there's a lot of unrealized potential, but overall I would still say this is a decent game. It's plenty of fun, it's got some advantages/cool features that Payday 2 doesn't have, and although it doesn't quite rise to the level of Payday 2 (duh, it's basically perfection), it's still a fun heist game. As more heists and updates are released, I believe a lot of that untapped potential will continue to become realized."}

This is not an RPG. This is an Action Adventure that plays like Monster Hunters. Its more of a 3d arcade combat game. Character development is solely for the purpose of how you fight and has nothing to do with the actual story. you run around the map attacking and dodging. That's basically the game. Dialogue is minimal. After I started playing the game I was like \"What is actually going on?\" So, I decided to watch some playthrough videos to get a better idea of how to play. With the way everyone was talking I was expecting something like WoW or even Diablo buy no, its just basically 3D arcade play."}

Basically any mode like BF3, BC2, 1942 can be good; normal game isn't fun and no rush by default. Games fill with bots but it never evens the # of humans so you have to keep leaving and finding a new game that's not 1 sided. 2 C4 can't even kill 1 of the shields support place which is wild. Emp grenades and the auto projectile destroyer are king but no one uses the former when the latter are down. Air vehicles are annoying as shit as usual but they took it to another level with stealth chopper that drops bombs. Hovercraft is sick for getting wild, hitting sick jumps and running people over even with the fact that no one will get inside and be a gunner with you."}

The skill trees work well with almost any build you have in mind. I'm still annoyed about the railroading story, but I'm glad to have a 3d Cyberpunk game to play. All in all, good game, would recommend to play for driving around aimlessly, picture taking, or even build experimenting."}

I was genuinely excited, hoping for a worthy successor, but what we got felt like a completely different game in the worst way.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay lost the gritty, intense vibe that made PAYDAY 2 so addicting. And the graphics… they’ve gone with this weird, almost Fortnite-like aesthetic that completely kills the atmosphere. It doesn’t feel grounded or immersive anymore—it feels cartoony and soulless.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to love PAYDAY 3, but it just doesn’t have the charm, depth, or style that made the second game so incredible. Honestly, it feels like a step backward in almost every way."}

For $3, it's fine, but I was always under the impression that the game ended up redeeming itself like most failed Battlefield launches.

Now that I'm done with that slop, I'll probably never play this game again. Half-tempted to recommend it because again, for $3, it's perfectly fine, but I don't actively want to sit down and play this game, it feels like a half-hearted attempt at turning Battlefield into MW19. (At least 80% of my play time was on those AFK farm servers, so my opinion isn't 75 hours' worth of gameplay.)"}

From what I have heard the initial launch of Definitive was really rough, but playing this in late 2025-2026 I can confirm this is the perfect way to play the game.

If you can manage your time spent in the game well it's very fulfilling and enjoyable with friends. The main requirement to play the game is having at minimum two people who you can consistently complete raids with in order to not get stuck for hours in each raid.

They actually sold out. But of course, it had to be the most repugnant and morally bankrupt investors: Jared Kushner and the Saudi Arabian government. You know, the son-in-law of the orange abomination called Trump, and the same people who cut up Jamal Khashoggi into tiny little pieces for speaking out against his government.

All this DLC and I can't even launch the game. I hope they fix this, but even if they do, I know I won't hear about it anyway. Literally the first review I ever dropped on a game and it's such a negative one. How is this so bad I took the time out of my day to write my first ever review??? Would not recommend, froze my system on startup twice and gave me the out of memory error 4 times. I have a 4070 Ti and a 14900k... DO BETTER! \n\nI read the community board and people are posting that their servers are not able to handle the influx of people due to the sale and even more shocked that they can't even validate their game. I'm not a very technical person and could care less to know the jargon they used, however, this is what I gathered from those posts. If what I said doesn't make sense or is just wrong, who cares? Game doesn't load and has froze my system and lead to crashes multiple times. Never have I ran into this problem on any other game."}

I'd rather play Payday 2.\n\nNow after I played all heists avaliable without dlc I can add that this game is very irritating, sometimes its looks like Payday 2 is Payday 3 sequel because some mechanics there work a lot better. They added a lot of minigames that look like taken from a web game. Payday 2 also had more gritty atmosphere sometimes it resembled a serious bank robbbery movies like Heat sometimes more action movie and even more elaborate heists in the style of Oceans 11. This game is so focused on being very modern with non-stop hacking and stealing chips or crypto wallets that it feels like an 90s hacker movie. There are some good heists I enjoyed but mostly they were easy, irritating and repetitive."}

Given enough time and DLC drops this game will probably end up the same as the 2nd with everyone saying it was \"always a good game\". Another thing Payday 2 has been worked on for countless years whilst this hasnt been so obviously its not gonna be as big as the game that has more than 10+ years of dev work put into it."}

The stealth mechanics were the only upgrade done in this title, with every other factor being a direct downgrade from the previous title. If I listed the lack of content in this review it would look like a Wikipedia article of the Talmud. My greatest grievance for this game was the lack of a “pick a card” system after heisting. Something that was definitive for payday, and it’s just gone without an explanation. Same with pre-planning. Same with crime.net, although I hear they FINALLY added the OG crime.net UI back. The game looks like it was made with AI. Yeah. Don’t buy it. I wouldn’t support these devs ever again after their most recent business practice; which is a subscription system for DLC on a decade old game."}

I say in terms of open-world/sandbox games compared to the GTA series -- this lands in S-Tier for me. Great balance between aesthetics, missions and side-stories.

I’ve already spent over an hour just trying to get a stable and reasonable FPS, and the game still randomly drops from 60 FPS down to 20 out of nowhere.\n\nThis game is terribly optimized for PC. The fact that I’ve tried around 20 different “solutions” from YouTube videos and Google searches—each promising to make the game playable—says everything. The graphics settings barely matter at all. I can run similar games at 1440p, 60 FPS on medium settings without any issues, yet here even 1080p on low settings can’t deliver acceptable performance.\n\nI’m extremely disappointed. I expected a lot more from this game. It’s painfully obvious that it was developed with consoles in mind and the PC version was treated as an afterthought. I checked the recommended PC requirements and my system fully meets them, but I’m not willing to waste any more time just trying to make this disappointment playable at all.\n\nIt it works for you, that's great.

Technicly an MMO. You'll see other players all the time but most of the content will be played solo. However this game is a partial collectathon. There is quite litterally thousands of collectibles little things in the game that give fun rewards. It scratches an itch I didnt know I had. If you like ARPGs or MMOs just try it. Game looks great and plays great.\n\n\nI have not ever felt inclined to spend money on this game. Only untill im at the peak-PEAK of the End-Game do I see an upgrade system that pushes you towards it. However this is after 650+ hours of gameplay. I could simply just not engage anymore or slow my progression.\n\nIt does still have bot issues. Most of the time they're just an eye sore. Bands of them clogging up some afk town spot. However you do have to occasionaly work around them in some of the easy end-game content. Frustrating but one of my only major complaints."}

It’s not on the level of Battlefield 3 or 4 which are still my top picks but there’s a solid game buried under all that mess. The gun-play feels good, squad play can still deliver that classic Battlefield chaos and some of the updates genuinely improved the experience. It still has its flaws, like weak map design and questionable balance but if you go in with tempered expectations, there’s fun to be had. It’s not the Battlefield we wanted but it’s no longer the joke it started as.\n\nAs Battlefield 6 approaches in couple of days, 2042 is worth revisiting only if you want to appreciate how far it’s come and how far the series still needs to go."}

It has some amazing moments, like raids or story arcs or gameplay, that make it really shine, however it is definitely lacking in some areas. If you dont mind timed /grinding/ difficult content you'll probably enjoy the vast majority of the game, but the game really loses its charm once you start hitting content walls because your gear isn't high enough.

This is only the third time I’ve experienced something like this. So far, only Skyrim and Far Cry 3 (which is my first and last platinum) managed to pull me in this hard.\n\nI probably don’t need to say this, but I highly recommend this game."}

The story is \"meh\" but that's not what you're playing for.\n\nThe raids were pretty awesome and challenging. However, I can't recommend this game purely on the fact of how awful the grind is. Trying to get the best gear will cost you hours upon hours basically thru a lottery system, hoping the upgrade is successful verses the possibility of losing your upgrade item, or even the entire piece of gear. Almost forcing you to spend real cash on items that increase the success rate.\n\nIf you don't mind grind insanity or don't care about getting the best gear, then you may enjoy this game. But I can't recommend a game that operates like this."}

This game really gives you the power of choice in almost every situation and you can build your character to your exacting specifications. For instance, if you want a stealth build there are implants that make you almost impossible to detect. If you want to be all netrunner and be able to hack others implants and weapons from afar, you can do that. The choices that you make affect how the game continues. I plan on playing through more than once so that I can experiment more with what is possible."}

The side factors, such as the fact that there are many activities in it, the side missions are generally enjoyable, the satisfactory size of the map makes the game valuable, the 2 most interesting cities of the state of California and Las Vegas are again very realistic in this game. This version has not lost much of the quality of the old one, this game promises to be the most varied of the trilogy. I encountered fewer bugs and lighting problems than in the other two games, so I was able to concentrate more on the side quests and events. The old version was a 10/10 game, and this version is a 10/9 game.\n\nIt is definitely an affordable buy during the discount period. If you are interested in the 90s, this is a production not to be missed.[/b]"}

The game plays differently to it's predecessor. While I'd say payday 2 is more like a sandbox almost where you can mess around with different perk decks, weapons and skills to enhance said weapons and some other gameplay elements while also shooting a bunch of enemies with enough variety ( I will admit though that the lack of the medic unit in payday 3 is a good thing but the inclusion of new ones like the nader or techie has been done poorly ) and the game being overall chaotic ( and fun ), this game is taking things slower when it comes to action and limits the things you can mess around with. Overall I would recommend getting payday 2 over payday 3, especially during a sale where you can get a LOT of content in the second game for a fair price ( that cannot be said about payday 3 which lacks content that is worthwhile to this day)."}

Vertical system over vertical system so it starts to feel more like mobile game and honestly last months I am more angry about game than I am enjoying it. Game is bleeding out players, it is plagued by bots (I would say that like half Steam population are bots at this point), people are RMTing from 3rd party websites and there is no punishment, meanwhile new players are often banned by horrible automatic systems which are supposed to ban bots, but they are obviously not working properly and customer support is basically non-existant... honestly when I am writing this I am just thinking why the hell I was playing so long..."}

It's a good game don't get me wrong. It does became a rather grind late game when it comes to gear, but let's be honest that's expected for MMORPGs. It did become P2W in some cases, but that is also expected. The primary reason I stopped playing however? The community was very toxic when I stopped. If you didn't spend 30 minutes to study a guide before attempting a group raid, expect to never find willing players, be kicked, or have it end prematurely by the host. They are very salty about this and training lobbies were practically nonexistent. It didn't help said raids could be very punishing with party wipe mechanics in multiple phases.\n\nThat being said, I do recommend it. It's free to play and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. I definitely did, but just understand once you hit the late game, it feels rather repetitive and you're at the mercy of the community's attitude unless you're contribute to that part of that problem."}

It has floating textures like the other two, and some awful rendering distance, but an incredibly enjoyable and pretty version of the game that's a few mods away from being the Definitive way to experience San Andreas in the modern day."}

The maps range from small to large.  Sniping is pretty good.  The sound quality is great.  Not really a fan of buying \"skins\" for weapons or uniforms so I just avoid buying anything that requires \"real\" money.  You have to get an account with EA to play online (I think).  I don't really use the EA play app ; I find you don't need to log into it to play the game  just to register (?).  Any whos, it's pretty fun.

The daily/weekly content grind is monotonous. The community is not very friendly and is outright toxic towards new players. Horizontal systems can provide several hours of entertainment if you enjoy that aspect of completion in games. The vertical progression in the game is incredibly steep with a lot of poorly designed systems. All of the friction in game that you encounter is by design. The game is very predatory and the developers are trying to induce heavy spending in the game via the cash shop. If you can look past all of this you might still enjoy the game. But it's not surprising the game is in it's current state."}

Vehicles spawning in the floor, or in the roof of tunnels\r\n3. Jetpack jets do not move\r\n4. For some reason, poor performance in the LS countryside\r\n5.

And one that extorts you in the slowest, grindiest, most painful manner possible. Any progression in endgame comes directly from your wallet, and good luck figuring out which one of the 354 currencies in the game you need to purchase to actually progress.  This is the type of game that started amazeballs in concept, then got absolutely rap*d by the grind mechanics designed to force players to pay for progression. This and Diablo immortal are predatory to an unbelievable degree. \n\nThis game cannot be fixed or brought to heel at this point. I suggest you leave it to the asian whales that the developers literally have said thats all they care about. Literally."}

Bizarre development choices make this entry feel so out of place that it hardly resembles a Battlefield game. Although I have given the game a chance, I am still dealing with bugs that make it quite a tedious experience. \r\n\r\nI can never open the game successfully on the first try. I have to open the game, close it and then launch it once again otherwise I'm faced with an endless beeping satellite cutscene. I also struggle to play with friends as we can't stay in the same lobby from match to match. We are instead forced back to the menu and we have to invite each other every single time.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, there is no campaign. That alone is not a dealbreaker for me but if they go down the route of solely focusing on multiplayer, you would want it to be near flawless and polished, which it isn't. \r\n\r\nSkip this one, there are better alternatives. \r\n4/10"}

However, I do see a trend coming where in order to keep playing and having fun there will be a lot of DLCs needing to be purchased in future updates, so that's disappointing. A lot of games do this, however this game seems like they penny pinch you a little more than others."}

In GTA V, the world is big, but most interactions feel shallow, you can drive anywhere, cause chaos, and follow the main story, but outside of that, your choices rarely matter. The city feels more like a backdrop than a place that reacts to you.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I avoided Cyberpunk 2077 for so many years. I assumed it would be the same kind of “open world for the sake of size” experience. I was wrong.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk’s Night City feels alive. Side quests aren’t just filler; they’re often better written than the main story in other games. Your choices actually change how characters treat you, how missions unfold, and sometimes how entire storylines end. You’re not just moving through the world — you’re shaping your version of it.\r\n\r\nOnce I started playing, I couldn’t stop. The atmosphere, the characters, and the storytelling stayed in my head even when I wasn’t playing.\r\n\r\nIt’s so cinematic and well-directed that if this game were turned into a movie, I’d watch it without hesitation."}

However, some aspects feel neglected because it's basically just a graphical upscale on a different engine, and there are certain issues, like annoying stuttering, despite having a high FPS.\n\nIt's not worth it at full price—only if it's on sale for 50% off or more"}

The only content so far is the easy cash grab dlc's with characters (one of which is a base heister in pd2) and two new (paid) missions. \nThere are a couple of new cool ideas, but they are implemented in the worst way possible + a lot of base game mechanics from pd2 were just cut. At the same time perfectly working simplest mechanics were remade for some reason into the most awkward mess i've ever seen.\nPlaying these same few missions without an ounce of replayability or meaningfull progression or even a good amount of meaningful visual customization is very boring if not exhausting.\nA couple of QoL changes (or community mods) that should have been here from the release would have made this piece of crap atleast somehow playeable but alas.\n\nSeriously just play the PayDay 2 again or even PayDay the heist. Do not spend your money on this piece of regurgitated fast cash grab vomit and if you do - be sure to not play more than 2 hours so you still can return it because i cannot see this game getting the No Man's Sky treatment."}

I had a lot of fun just playing though the base game. I never got into the end game content but it was there if I wanted to try it. \nRecently I tried Lost Ark out again. I made a new character to get a fresh start. Off the rip I noticed a scary amount of Bots. Just an amalgamation of default characters all wearing the same outfit standing in the exact same spot. I thought it might just be the the starting areas that had this. NOPE. I logged into my old main and even in the high level areas the exact same issue happening. Just having this many bots standing around is enough for me to say 'nope, I'm not playing' but to add, the bots also hurt the economy of the game, so even if I did play, I get to look forward to a jumbled mess of an economy when I do get to endgame. \nRIP Lost Ark."}

Don't be surprised if the new form of lock-on system gets you killed more than once...thanks game, I totally wanted to aim for the guy behind me and not the dozen Ballas running at me with AKs...\r\n\r\nThat said, it is very good to be back in San Andreas and playing these missions, because even now it is among the finest of RPGs I've ever played.

The constant need to reinstall the game is unacceptable, and I’ve repeatedly been prevented from progressing through the story due to severe technical issues. Multiple save files have crashed and become completely unusable, including older saves, effectively erasing hours of progress.\n\nI’ve spent nearly 20 hours replaying the first and second acts across three separate saves, only to hit the same game-breaking issue every time. The game consistently freezes and flatlines during the Silverhand bomb mission, making further progress impossible regardless of the save used.\n\nWhile there is clearly a good game underneath, its extreme instability completely undermines the experience. At its current state, I cannot recommend it. Enjoyment means very little when the game is fundamentally unreliable and unable to function as expected."}

Payday 2 was an amazing game that never felt extremely frustrating or repetitive with some exceptions. \n\nI was upset to see the horrible launch of Payday 3 and I myself, trashed the game for said horrible launch. I have watched them try to fix this game and bring it to a playable and worthwhile state and in my opinion..\n\nI think they have.\n\nI don't agree with the fact that so much is locked behind paywalls. I hate it a lot actually. \nI can't really find any reason to really hate this game.\n\nI wouldn't buy this full price though. Wouldn't even think about it. On sale though, (like right now) it may become worth takng.\n\nEither way. I think the game has recovered to a playable state. Doesn't mean a good state but.. playable."}

Matchmaking can get messy, and sometimes it feels like the game is allergic to letting you into a lobby. But once you’re in? Pure, beautiful mayhem. Lasers, loot bags, hostages screaming, alarms blaring—chef’s kiss.\r\n\r\nDespite the rocky support, I’m still genuinely excited to see what they’ve got planned next.

Night City feels alive in a way that is hard to explain. You are not just following a main quest. You are listening to conversations. Reading messages. Stumbling into side stories that feel personal and sometimes uncomfortable. The game rewards slowing down and paying attention more than rushing from objective to objective.\r\n\r\nI also love how open it all feels. You can get lost in the city without feeling like you are playing it wrong. Some nights you follow the story. Other times you just drive, explore, or take on a small job that turns into something bigger. The game is at its best when you let go of the need to complete everything and just exist in the world for a while."}

The marketing promised total freedom, you can’t do anything close to that. Years later, with expectations properly lowered, I put another 50 hours into it. It’s an ok game for the right audience, but it is not for me.\n\nThe open world and atmosphere are strong, but the quests are dull. It feels like a short movie stretched thin to fill a game. Nothing you do in gameplay affects the story. By the end I was a one man army, yet Rogue still told me she had no work because of my “bad reputation” from one failed scripted gig.\n\nThe only time the game acknowledges your strength is after the secret ending which, for my full melee build, felt like any other mission: 11 minutes of fighting wrapped in an hour of talking.\n\nIn the end, the game looks better than it plays. If you want atmosphere and cutscenes, you might enjoy it, but if you expect meaningful choices, or real player agency, it still falls short."}

Payday 2 had a much larger variety of weapons, including akimbo (duel-wielded) weapons than Payday three, and the system of buying weapons is through vendors, but the way they organize the weapons is messy and confusing. They also removed a major mechanic from the game, perk decks, which  the lack thereof ruined my enjoyment of the game. Additionally, the Payday team decided to completely remove all melee customization and effectively made melee useless, which I was very disappointed to learn.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game is very fun if you want to play a stealth/puzzle game, but as a horde shooter, it massively lets down the player due to the lack of choice in weapons and skills."}

CS has never been about quick changes or hype. Things are often improved only when they really need to be — but when Valve does something, they usually do it right.\n\nOver the years, almost everything has improved:\nthe graphics, the sound design, the maps, and especially the skins. Counter-Strike feels more modern than ever while still staying true to its core identity.\n\nWhat also makes CS unique is that it’s more than just a game.\nWith the skin economy, it’s possible to build a portfolio over time and — with patience and smart decisions — actually earn money. Very few games combine skill, competition, nostalgia, and a real economy like this.\n\nFor me, one thing is clear:\nCounter-Strike will still be around for many decades to come.\nA timeless classic that continues to evolve without losing what made it legendary."}

The gameplay is fast, competitive, and heavily skill-based, which makes every match feel intense and rewarding.\r\n\r\nThe competitive mode is what really keeps me coming back. Climbing ranks gives you a constant goal, and every game feels like a chance to improve. Playing with friends makes it even better—good teamwork and clutch moments create unforgettable experiences.\r\n\r\nOverall, CS2 is a game that never gets boring. Its competitive nature, combined with the fun of playing with friends, makes it easy to play “just one more match” every time."}

Absolutely gotta buy the DLC though, phantom liberty is very much needed, it feels like you're missing most of the game without the DLC so you need it, but it's another $20 over the original game, could be cheaper because I bought the base game for $20 too, $20 for game and $20 for DLC, around $40 I spent."}

The guns are great, and the new heists are pretty fun.\n\n\"The only thing lacking in this game right now is the skill tree.\" \n\nWell, I have good news: they have completely overhauled the skill system. The new cop health/armor system, combined with the armor-piercing skills and armor-breaking skills, makes gameplay fun AND CONSISTENT. You no longer have to micromanage your EDGE and GRIT; now you just get the buffs you spent your hard-earned skill points for. I would finally say the game is in a genuinely good place now. Would highly recommend for only 30$ nowadays."}

The core of San Andreas—its sprawling world, rich story, and addictive gameplay—remains just as engaging and nostalgic as ever. Exploring Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas with Carl “CJ” Johnson’s journey through gang wars, corruption, and personal redemption is timeless. The Definitive Edition improves on textures, lighting, and character models, aiming to deliver a fresher visual experience. However, these upgrades often fall short of expectations, with inconsistent graphics, awkward animations, and technical hiccups that occasionally disrupt immersion. Controls and user interface improvements inspired by newer Rockstar titles are welcome, making gameplay smoother than the original. While longtime fans might appreciate the nostalgia and newcomers get a chance to experience a GTA classic, the Definitive Edition struggles to fully honor the original’s legacy due to its rough execution. Still, beneath the flaws lies a sprawling and memorable adventure that remains one of the most influential open-world games ever made.\n\nRating: 7/10"}

I had more fun on BF2042 than I did with Battlefield 5 and their abhorrent vehicle spam-fest and unlimited sniper nests. At least this entry in the series gives you *some* options to deal with annoyances, albeit they aren't the greatest solutions, especially when they rely on having teammates with half a brain like using my favorite tool, the tracer darts, but it's something at least.\n\nStill, most matches are a sweatfest, just like any other shooter game post-2015ish, but a majority of matches only had a handful of sweat squads while the other 20~25 players are your typical \"controller Fortnite Timmy\" players, so that's something at least.\n\nLastly, the removal of the suppression mechanic is simply a completely terrible design decision.\n\nIs it worth full price? God, no. Was I an idiot and didn't read the reviews before buying the completely worthless Elite Edition? Yes I am."}

The Cyberpunk Sci-fi elements, aesthetics and lore are so detailed and well fleshed out. The story is so raw and gut wrenching, often times forcing us to make decisions that are morally grey. From the storytelling to the narrative Cyberpunk 2077 paints a picture of a world not to dissimilar from our own, one ran by corporate greed and corruption. A story where desperate people resort to crime in order to make end meet. A story where often times there are no happy endings. Lots of characters like Johnny Silverhand and V for example are so well written, and have deeply complex personalities and compelling motivations."}

I fought the watchdogs like 13 times.\r\nEven story bosses aren't exent of being copy pasted despite of their unikeness. The cobat is really good, this is the most fun i had with  combat in the souls series, there are a ton of variety of weapons armors, playstyles. \r\nI think this is the most beutiful looking game fromsoft has made so far, the music is great and artstyle is the best.

I had never played a Dark Souls game before but I like challenging games. I am not going to lie I absolutely HATED this game my first play through. It is open world. No markers on the map telling you where to go. No warning for when you are about to smack a mob above your weight class ( I AM LOOKING AT YOU TREE SENTINEL).  I had to learn how to roll. I had to learn WHEN to roll. It just seemed like I kept getting destroyed no matter where or what I fought. I stopped playing for a number of months and then started playing again. The second time, I FORCED myself to learn how to play it correctly. I accepted that I was going to die but I wanted to start learning from it . Once I did that, the game became incredible. I wasn't afraid to fight things because I could manage it. I did not have to use a summon or ashes of war on every boss. I am able to save runes and can now level up along with my gear. I even learned that just because an enemy is sitting there, does not mean I have to fight it . Make the investment and learn how to play this game. It is so worth it."}

There wasn't any super cool stuff and the problems were all still there. It's been over 2 years now, and I thought about checking in on the game to see if it was finally playable again. I look at the forums and all the posts are about server outages. Super sad that Starbreeze ruined a super fun franchise. 10/10 do not recommend."}

It takes me less time to watch paint dry, which is a similar experience to what i had with PD3's gameplay.\n\nIf you want a bank heist game with decent graphics, something that's well optimised and has the same playability of PayDay 2, don't look here. \n\nWhat.

Hazard zone was a bad extraction mode that felt rushed and portal is half baked. Overall just avoid this entry and wait to buy 6 or even support the communities that still play the older titles."}

People buying your game are faced with few heists with low replayability since the maps almost do not change from one time to another. They are hungry for content and then told they need to spend the price of the game a second time for less content.

I had played for too long to get my money back and didn't end up enjoying the game. So i lost interest. It's been 5 years and I regained interest in it. I'm very much enjoying it now and the FPS are phenomenal now and I'm really enjoying the game with over 40 hours now. I purchased the DLC for extra story line and game play.

I like the isometric gameplay idea, reminds me a lot of Dungeon Siege days. The classes are really fun to play, the skills are extremely flashy, and the overall hack & slash nature of the game is very well done imho. I'm making my way through the story and not using the Power Pass to skip it, and for a casual gamer like me, it's good enough. Maybe there's P2W elements that I'm not aware of, or other game-breaking experiences that others may have had, but for me, it's definitely worth sinking hours into because it's quite honestly a different experience than your generic MMORPG."}

This system is neither limited to cosmetics nor simply offers additional content through DLCs. Instead, it is integrated into the core game loop of gearing up, persuading players to spend large sums. Moreover, the inclusion of in-game currency conversion is deceptive, obscuring the real-world cost of in-game purchases.\n\nOn a positive note, the combat in 'Lost Ark' is nothing short of phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed the engaging combat mechanics, the diversity of classes, and the overall design of the game and its maps. However, the game's heavy reliance on exploiting consumer psychology for monetary gain ultimately led me to stop playing. It's disheartening to see a game with such potential undermined by a monetisation strategy focused on extracting every penny from its players."}

Vehicles are fun and varied, but the gunplay, attachments, and especially the maps lack depth, the latter being the biggest offender with huge, empty spaces that just feel bad to play on.\n\nSome post-launch maps and updates are decent, and overall the game has become a pretty casual Battlefield experience that can be fun in short bursts. I don’t see it staying alive once BF6 arrives, but revisiting it to unlock the free pass content was a decent time."}

I'd say you're better off playing this game on console, Im playing on my mac book pro M1 chip and shouldve done my research before playing as I do enjoy the game, feel i would've enjoyed more on console because its more so meant to handle a game like this, especially new gen. I had a lot of lag spites, glitches that kind of threw off the experience but overall game is immersive and fun, a lot of cut scenes and story heavy in terms of half the game is the story/cut-scenes instead of acutal gameplay but decent and beautiful details through night city and building, alot more to do than GTA or most free-world games. Almost to the point it could be semi- somewhat complicated to someone not too keen on grabbing on to things as quickly as a alot isnt explained throughout the game and kind of has to be figured out. With all that said to sum it up, Great immersive game more enjoyable if you have a system or pc made to handle it."}

The art and character design are top-notch, and the small group content makes connecting with others easier.\n\nBut there are two big issues:\n\nPay-to-win is real. Over time, the game shifted to heavily reward spending money, especially if you want to keep up with guilds or higher-end content.\n\nThe grind is brutal.

From what I've seen of friends trying to get me back into the game, the bot problems are still really bad and this game still requires you to play it like a 2nd job in order to get anywhere without whaling out the ass. \n\nCombat is good, legion raids can be fun, but you don't really get to enjoy all the combat until you invest a ton of time into the game, and then you have to find a group, make a bunch of alts to funnel resources into you main, do every raid 6 times a week, then daily chores etc.\n\nGame is literally just good combat wrapped in terrible systems that are designed to form habits and normalize spending money. I pity anyone who is still playing this game at this point."}

Much like Skyrim, Cyberpunk came out in a bit of a rancid state although this game was worse. Neither game gives you much agency over what happens in the world, although Cyberpunk is a bit better in this regard. Both games give you a rich, well-realized, lore-rich world to inhabit and play in, and Cyberpunk's mod support isn't half bad. Unlike Skyrim, though, Cyberpunk's updates only make the game better. (There's some controversy over the netrunning rework from 2.0, but I don't mind those changes.)"}

I figured I'd give it a shot, but after 10.9 hours of attempt - with two different characters - I'm throwing in the towel.\r\n\r\nWhile it appears there is a plethora of content, the various areas of the game clearly are locked behind high-level bosses who one-/two-shot players. Even within the early area of the game, there are mini-boss characters who absolutely wreck, without the player having a chance apart from staying out of their view. Going into a swampy area and heading toward a small island resulted in a massive dragon that dropped out of the sky and one-shot'd me without so much as a \"Good evening, crunchy!\"\r\n\r\nApart from the actual play, the menus are not intuitive but instead seem to be an after-thought. Figuring out how things work, where to go to set up primary- and secondary-arrows for bows required looking information up online instead of any tutorial. The learning curve is exceptionally steep while the enjoyment factor is low.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'll be asking Steam for a refund. One day of playing this was far more than enough for me."}

I have watched the devs work and add to the game to make it a decent Battlefield game, they only promised 4 seasons, we got 7 with some mini ones, and a bonus Battlefield celebration season out of nowhere which was super cool, so thank you so much for all of that. Is it different from other Battlefields sure, did it lack a story mode yes (In which is really sad, the lore in the CODEX was super cool, and it's a shame all the lore and the story is reduced to that and seasons.) But at the end of the day, it's still a decent FPS. Movement and gunplay feel great, some maps were good, and the specialists were ok, different yes, but I didn't have a huge issue with them. But if you ask me if I regretted getting a physical PC copy for like $25, and then buying it on Steam for $5, I'll say no, not at all. I really had a great time with 2042, and I'm sure I always will."}

I can think of every heist where having color-coded wires scattered on map for \"wifi takeover\" or even a device you put on the modem would make the heist 99% more enjoyable and replayable, and backporting the breach devices even as just an option would solve most problems people have with most heists that has circles in this game.

With all these voice lines, taunt animations, killbinds, ragdolls and bugs, that became crucial part of the game. There's a reason it's fans still root and fight for it for over a decade at this point. Even if there's quite a few more hero shooters nowadays, they can't achieve the style and communicability of TF2. And even if, other big companies won't go for it anyways, they only wanted the competitive part.\nIn other words, there probably won't be any kind of game that would somehow replace it, probably not even from indie devs. Maybe I'll be proven otherwise ten years later, but... who knows, who knows..."}

There are only eight base heists, and most of them aren’t even that good. Some are so short you can finish them in minutes. Others are recycled from previous games with little to no change—so if you played Payday 2, why bother with this one?\n\nAbout half of the currently existing weapons and heists, which there aren't that many of to begin with, have to be paid for through DLC's. Honestly, they should've just kept adding new content to the game they already had instead of selling back the same content for more money. \n\nIf you were only planning on buying the base game, don't do it, you'll only get about a week of game time in until you get bored. And even if you buy the DLC, you only get four more heists on top of the eight base ones. What you should do instead is buy Payday 2 and don’t look back for another 3–5 years until they've caught up. Or maybe don't. Support developers with less scummy strategies, who actually care about their community instead of viewing them as wallets to steal."}

But this game honestly is a ton of fun despite them, especically the new stealth mechanics, and being able to stealth effectively with a \"loud\" build. I honestly love that concealment is gone as you can build your builds loud and not have to worry about needed to restart because your build is ENTIRELY focused on stealth every heist. The gunplay is SUPER fun! Though unlocking attachments is lame ngl. I miss perk decks but overkill weapons are fun imo, especially the new Jacket sociopath bat. I think this game has alot of potential and if you are interested in it give it a try when it goes on sale. I really want to see it grow and improve as it does have a long way to go, but I am optimistic."}

I saw it on sale and thought now is the time to try. This game is not good at all. It feels like it could have been made in Roblox. It feels tacky, the difficulty is incredibly easy no matter what you change it to, the gunplay feels very empty, the maps look so bleak and void of detail, the character voice lines are very half done, the fact that solo mode has only just come out for this game and is still in beta is also very odd to me. the lack of normal missions that are included in the game is minimal, and I personally feel that it is mental that they have already brought out DLC missions. The weapon selection (again without paying for DLC) is abysmal. \n\nThis game has been out for more than long enough to have had the above things ironed out. Payday 2 was always going to be a hard card to trump, but this is not even close at all. it feels rushed, empty of character, and simply a money grab attempt as a follow on from it's predecessor. \n\nEven at the low price it is currently at, do not buy it. Get Payday 2 for half the price, double the content, and triple the enjoyment."}

Even though its gameplay and combat is top tier, the microtransactions and P2W aspects of the game breaks it IMO. It makes it that you have to grind for a extremely long time to be able to get good gear, while you can it right away if you pay. I had good 60 hours played when it first came out without paying anything, it was fun. But then got stale real quick when you came to the grinding part. The could learn how to monetize a game without it being P2W or unfair from Digital Extremes, which makes \"Warframe\". Warframe is also free to play with fair and no P2W microtransactions. We should not accept such tasteless practices from any developer/publisher, even though koreans are infamous for their scummy business practices in gaming."}

But even with mods and patches, the game is still a bit unstable and you get things like textures and objects appearing in front of you or crashes. So far, I do enjoy playing this movie."}

Your actions do have consequences, which is good, but their logic is completely unclear. In that case, even the most brilliant plot goes down the drain.\n\nThe interface is a whole other story: it's such an ancient mess that it feels like the Japanese developer who made it must be 200 years old. You should be glad they managed to come up with anything at all.\n\nAs for the music, it's absolutely forgettable. Even now, while playing, I can't recall a single track. The rest of the sound design is decent, though.\n\nThe open world is another disappointment. It's not just uninteresting—it’s so oddly designed that you stop caring about it entirely. When everything is hidden behind secret walls, floors, and jars, and that's the only trick the game relies on, smashing walls becomes boring after just a couple of hours. Especially when yet another secret only hides a rune arc or some useless grease."}

Unfortunately those are the only pros that I have for the game.\n\nCons: The first negative piece I have about Payday 3 is going to be the server issue. I truly cannot fathom what would make Starbreeze make this an online only game, AND remove the ability to play heists solo. There's a solo mode beta, but it still takes a decent bit of time to load even while using fibre and a high end PC. The weapon variety is also abysmal comparitively when you're not considering DLC weapons. I enjoy the waves rework, but I hate the \"Final charge\" system. It feels like it's their way of forcing you off the server to free up space for other heisters.\n\nWill add more/tweak review after some more playtime."}

Level destrution isn't as noticeable as bf4, but you can still shotgun a hole in a wall of a house and snipe from it if you want. Thats battlefield man. \r\n\r\nThis game is cool because you can CALL-IN a vehicle thats ready for spawn right to you using points youve earned from capturing objectives or getting kills, guess what? They drop from the sky like magic right to you in about 2 seconds. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?!!

I would reccommend getting payday 2 at that point. One big plus i could see for friend groups is that it has crossplay. So you can hiest with your friend that decided to buy a playstation instead of a pc for example. \n\nOverall TLDLR: 2 years later the game is pretty fun and worth your money but its still very content bare compared to payday 2 (although remember that payday 2 is 12 years old at this point)"}

Now, in 2025, a couple years after 2.0 came out, the game is even better. I liked it back then, but now it feels like one of the best games of all time, easily on par with Witcher 3. It needed some time in the oven and now it's near perfect. \r\n\r\nI do recommend getting some mods for the character customization, that is this game's primary con for me, there just isn't enough customization options and some of them weirdly lock you to gendered things. Thankfully, there are mods to fix it, but I would still say the vanilla game is near perfect, and the modding scene is well supported by CDPR so it's pretty easy to install everything, even right in the middle of a playthrough. Speaking of playthroughs, im at 200+ hours on my second playthrough now, not including the first 50, and I think i'll finish the game around 300 hours total with everything done and seen (for the most part). I'll still have to do a third playthrough for the last lifepath :3 All this to say, this game is enormous and I love playing in this world"}

Fanging your car around in the badlands is always fun.\nI don't know how they managed to fit so much game into this game and still have every side quest and story feel unique and impactful.\nThe depth of the storytelling through characters, media, environment and just everything is unparalleled.

I would say the story can get a bit confusing at parts. I also felt underwhelmed by the main plotline. It wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. The witcher series had a much more enjoyable and interesting story line. I felt that the games atmosphere, gameplay and graphics is where it really shines. The gameplay is very in depth. You can take fighting to many different areas of expertise. You can be crafty and become a net runner, disabling attackers with net attacks. You can take the exact opposite and be more of a brawler and use melee weapons. The enemy combatants also take many different modes of attack towards you as well. So overall I would recommend the game as it shines in many areas and the part where it didn't shine in the story it made up for in it's other positives.\r\n\r\nfor short\r\nPositives\r\n+Atmosphere\r\n+Gameplay\r\n+Graphics\r\n\r\nNegatives\r\n-Underwhelming main plot"}

And the fact that it's just a tad easier than other Souls games in terms of enemies and the generousity of checkpoints (bonfires, site of grace etc) just makes a bit less frustrating when dying. I feel like this game can be played many times over without getting bored. \r\nIt is however giving me seconds-long lag spikes every now and then, which I dont know where it comes from, whether it's poorly optimization for PC or something running in the background that sets it off. And the game keeps running while the spike happens (not like freeze/lag if GPU was throttling or something, seems more like packet loss spike) so it kind of catches up after a sec or two, so I dont think it's hardware related (1440p, 5700x3d, 32GB ram, rtx 3080). It's getting annoying and i've seen that this is a known issue, I just assumed they would have fixed it after 3-4 years.\r\nBut other than that, really awesome game."}

Recent updates show a hint of promise but the fundamental issue of the games reliance on servers buggered up its launch and spells certain doom for its future. \n\nWhy am I searching for servers for my private lobby? Why does my game need to process painting a mask or buying a gun? Why am I being ushered through the pre-game setup, as if I have to get on with it and make room for the next group of heisters? Why am I lagging in my own sodding server? Leave me alone.\n\nIt's not a terrible foundation, really. But it will need time and effort to reach the level of content and depth of its systems Payday 2 has, the only question is: how many of us are willing to risk investing in this game until that point? After feeling robbed myself here, I don't think I am."}

So when they made a PC remaster for it then it gave me pleasure knowing I could return to my childhood! First things first: The visual style is definitely an improvement over the original but it does have some graphic errors like when random stuff pokes out of the road and that, but I did not let that stop me. The gameplay is very crisp and probably better than the PS2 version, and they improved the audio as well so the guns sound more clear when they fire.\r\n\r\nSo would I recommend this game? If the graphic glitches bother you then I would say no, but if that isn't a problem then I would say yes."}

Like in any other mmo game, better dps means less stressful time and it's not easy to deal good damage with every class.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of progression involved, if you pay lots of money you can skip most of them, or you need to grind f2p for months. But if you stop trying to speedrun and be the strongest (in a known p2w game), you can just play casually with less characters and less hours a day, there are a lot of horizontal content with good rewards and you can make gold from simple things like gathering or weeklies. Why you should bother with a p2w game ? Because it has some of the best content to play in rpg's. Of course, not a game for everyone."}

But hey, its a free game, so why not give it a try?\n\nThis game has an interesting story and an amazing character creator.  It's a shame that you never get to really see your character (or any one else's) because of the top-down isometric view point of the game.  You can mostly see the top of their head and they are small and feel far away.  I don't feel very immersed when i can't even see the combat animations properly.\n\nThe Korean VO pack was a nice DLC for free.  The English VO sounded very stilted and unnatural.  Still, that's only a minor flaw to me.  I could even tolerate the point and click movement style, even though it's not what i'd prefer.\n\nThe art style and concept of the game reminds me a lot of Black Desert or Blade and Soul, in the way that you destroy masses of enemies at once which can be fun and satisfying.

However, they gatekeep progression. The entire game is designed to make you want to pay. They do not allow you to just grind, because they set daily/weekly limits on every bit of gameplay. Which also makes matchmaking for endgame content a pain because unless you're in a guild and shelve out real cash to keep up with your guildmates, you're not going to have fun trying to find groups. If you can afford to blow a couple thousand dollars/euros, then this game could be really fun for you, if not then just look for something else."}

Pretty soon I’m actually flying to Kazakhstan to visit a Russian friend I’ve been playing with the last few years (side quest of the century fr). This goofy shooter has created some amazing experiences for me outside the game, not to mention the esports scene is absolutely incredible.  \n\nI recommend this game to people who have a lot of time on their hands to get addicted OR to try something new.

So i tried to focus on the story but that too felt lack lustre to me.\n\n[b] NB [/b] i do recommend is if you really want to have fun then find a group of people to play with as its soo much more enjoyable with others as it will let you fly pass the mundane parts of the game whilst engaging in the meaty stuff like dungeons, world bosses and raids.\n\nin conclusion try before you buy into this game and its F2P which is nice to give you a chance to figure it out if its for you,"}

Just very boring.  Same vibes for so long and combat is very slow and uncreative.  Most areas are blocked off by enemies too overpowered for you to defeat, so you're kinda just stumbling around for which way you are actually allowed to go.  Most enemy encounters at least have like 5 enemies too, so the game ends up playing more like a stealth than action game.  No real interesting music, visuals are serviceable but everything kinda just feels dull and depressing and kinda generic.  I liked the messages and ghosts everywhere from other players, that was funny/helpful.  Only positive I can really give it.  Maybe some will say it gets better after \"x\" amount of hours but I feel like thats the excuse for so many rpgs to just not have a hook and be lazy about that."}

DO NOT SPEND FULL PRICE, but hell yeah i had fun on sale, so that was worth it. also runs pretty good."}

If you have played the original extensively like I have you'll still enjoy it, but you'll find that it's FAR from perfect and most likely not better than the modded \r\n (big emphasis on modded) version of the non-trilogy version.

Yeah it still has bugs, but so far I've only had audio glitches and some collision issues with some spots in the map, but it's so minor I don't even care. The original game was buggy and I still enjoyed it. I wish this was better than it is, but it's good enough."}

The performance is really bad and special enemies are more annoying.

Because at some point in the heist a nader combo with cloaker is all that it takes to ruin your entire game. Everyone else gets downed then it's up to me to revive everyone and then cloaker comes in without warning or line of sight. I barely noticed the WULULULU before being knocked down and then it's the 5th unfair fail of the hour so I rage quit also I've never seen people rage quit cause of cloaker before hand and in both other PD games.\n\nOnly buy if you can get it below 5$ otherwise go buy PD the heist or PD2 dlcs as you'll find more fun in those"}

There's a reason many people call it the best game on the PS2.\n\nMy only complains are probably that the Radio OST is noticeably weaker than in VC and the gang warfare mechanic gets real old real fast.  Those are minor complaints though, SA is bloody brilliant and everyone should play it at least once."}

While the heists are fun and new, the amount of them pales in comparison to the previous game. Speaking of, comparing Payday 3 to Payday 2 is night and day. Both games have their advantages, Payday 2 is a lot more goofy and comedic with its weaponry and how the overall game acts, while Payday 3 takes a lot more of a realistic approach, which does actually work for it. The guns are fun and the perk system is fun and interesting to mess around with, but another issue is the paid content. For a game approaching 2 years old, a good chunk of the weaponry and the heists are locked behind DLC, which would be okay, if not for the fact the base game is $45! I really want this game to do well, as everything about it is fun, if not for the fact you have to pay an arm and a leg to play it. Please Starbreeze, give the game a medic bag and help it get out of custody."}

The smaller-scale combat helps mask the game’s biggest weakness, which is its large, often poorly designed maps.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the squad-based system limits coordination in larger public matches. With squads capped at four players, organizing as a single, cohesive team is nearly impossible. This restriction takes away the large-scale teamwork that Battlefield has always been known for.\r\n\r\nAs a group of ten friends, we can’t all join the same match like we could in past Battlefield titles. Unless we use custom Portal servers, we’re forced to split up, which really hurts the experience. Sadly, it seems this design direction may continue into Battlefield 6, which is disappointing for fans who miss the franchise’s classic large-squad coordination.\r\n\r\nBattlefield 2042 can still be fun in the right mode, but its restrictive squad system make it feel like a missed opportunity for the series."}

I've been playing a ton while I have a bunch of crystalline aura (their subscription) from the prime gaming drops, but there's no way I'll pay for Lost Ark after that runs out. It's fun but it isn't *that* fun.\n\nThe community is also really toxic. Not quite on the level of Runescape, but you're forced into way more group content than RS so it matters more."}

Bugs are scarce compared to launch. And weapon, gear, and character customization are vastly improved and creativity is welcome anywhere in your creations. Yes, payday 2 is thought to be superior to this game, but only because it had 10+ years in development. And that game was very beautifully sprouted throughout its support. If we want this game to be anything like payday 2, i believe we need to give the beautiful people at starbreeze some space, time, and support."}

This game is packed with so much to do and truly paved teh way for what the devs will release in the future. They fixed alot of the problems from the initial release, but there are still a few bugs, nothing game breaking, that make you roll your eyes. Some texture pop in, animations and sounds not playing properly etc. \nThere are a few frustrating aspects still present, such as AI driving the wrong way, or appearing out of no where on the highway going full speed at you. Random objects that have insane collision on them, noticed this alot on the races, such as San Fierro Hills, where the road posts, are moveable, but if you hit them, you may, or may not, go flying into the water.\nOr maybe the more funny ones, if you push an AI off their track in a chase or race, they will do whatever they can to get back to the point they were at. Such as the main mission, where you chase Pulaski in the desert, I pushed him off the cliff edge to the road below and then followed after him. He then drove straight up a vertical cliff to where I had pushed him off.\n\n....But it is definitely playable all the way through."}

The game is definitely still underbaked and needs a shit ton more work, but skills 2.0 was the best thing they could do and i'm glad they took this step forward despite the backlash and failure the game has presented.\n\nI loved this series since I was little and playing the shit out of PD2 was one of my favorite things in general.

Initially, the game fascinated me, and I played it non-stop for a year. However, over time, it became overwhelming with pay-to-win elements and gatekeeping. Learning the new raids became extra challenging. And here we are, the story and early leveling were enjoyable. The combat system was the most fun I've seen so far. However, the game evolving into its current state and the lack of various ways to earn gold are the reasons I've reached the end of the road. I had a lot of fun, but I don't think it would be the right choice for newcomers. You should have been there on launch day. Missing you LoA."}

My experience hasn’t been overwhelmingly negative but it’s very apparent it’s still has bugs. \n\nIf you have a way to play the original. Play the original. It’s better in every way possible.

Operation medic bag has added NOTHING except a few bug fixes, some new characters and like ONE NEW WEAPON (not counting the overkill bat) i will admit i had fun with the no rest for the wicked heist. only to find out THAT WAS THE ONLY FUN HEIST. Now i get it the game is \"fairly new\" but like COME ON STARBREEZE ITS BEEN 2 YEARS AND YOU ONLY RECENTLY GOT IT TO FUCKING FUNCTION. It took everything from payday 2 and said \"yk what if we like removed everything good about payday 2 and like added 20$ dlc's\". This shit is playable but like it aint good it aint so shit BUT ITS FUCKING MID AND BORING. In conclusion... i need a medic bag"}

You can still feel its age due to some of the mechanics and visuals reminding you it originally came out in 2004, BUT the remaster? It does a decent job cleaning things up for modern systems. I never actually finished or played San Andreas properly back in the day, just messed around on friends’ PCs, but now diving into it properly, it’s easy to see why it was such a big deal.\r\n\r\nThere’s an insane amount to do. That's a huge plus. The story isn't on the level of GTA IV’s which is more grounded, an emotional narrative, but it’s fun and packed with personality. You can also clearly see how many ideas from GTA V were born here.\r\n\r\nFor a game from 2004, it’s massive. The remaster helps make it more approachable today, and despite its rough edges, it’s still a blast to play. \r\n\r\nCurrently working on the 100%."}

On top of that it runs SO BAD. I can run Star Citizen in 4k 30 fps but this steaming pile of a game struggles to even start like I just timed it 6 minutes for the game to start. Oh and lets hope life doesnt pull you away from this game because if you started a guild youll lose your guild after 10 F*****G days I just lost mine that I started the very first day this game was available.

The plot draws you in more and more with each dialogue, and by the end of the game, you feel like you are living the experiences of your character. The main characters around whom the main story revolves are well thought out, each with a wonderful story and a wonderful ending to their story.\r\nOne of the game's strengths is its graphics. The graphics in this game are very beautiful and are the perfect complement to the cyberpunk world. You are fully immersed in the game world.\r\nUnfortunately, the game has a small flaw. There are bugs, and while playing through the game several times, I encountered NPCs who behaved inappropriately while driving vehicles. The most annoying bug is that at certain points in the game, I fell through the map, and to get out, you have to completely restart the game.\r\n(I also played the DLC for this game, which has an incredibly touching story with an unexpected ending. I recommend everyone buy the game together with the DLC!)"}

High amounts of replayability and decade defining! This game is probably the biggest reason there are so many Dark Souls knockoffs coming out recently. 30 million + copies are well deserved.\r\n\r\nFor those worried about difficulty, it is more challenging than your average Easy Mode in other video games. However, the developers have made changes to the Dark Souls formula that makes the game easier than its predecessors. These changes are likely the reason for why Elden Ring has sold so well. I find the game's difficulty to be less than the hardest difficulty of most other games, so it's not gonna be insanely impossible.\r\n\r\nI would compare the difficulty of this game to Super Mario Bros. 3 (not the gameboy version)."}

There's a solo mode now (although it's much more demanding on your computer) and most of the heists are at least somewhat fun. Dare I say, Boys in Blue is pretty damn good. Alot of the voice acting is amazing as well, with the pager/radio response lines taking the cake as some of the funniest. Chains calling himself a werewolf gave me a good chuckle when I was playing the tutorial, and Clover calling Dallas captain america will always be funny. The game is a little lacking with free content, and there's a lot of power creep with the desert eagle effectively making most other sidearms useless, but otherwise the content and weapon drought isn't too bad, especially considering you can join other people who have the DLC heists, just like in Payday 2. I'd say it's not worth 30 bucks right now, but pick it up when it's on sale."}

Joe-ass video game. I picked it up for way cheap in 2025 and had some fun with it. I kinda dig the near-future tone of the game. Gunplay feels kinda awkward like Battlefield V. Some good maps, but also some maps that just feel barren and unfinished. The hero system is just a strange decision, but once I'm in the game, I don't really notice it. I would've preferred just letting the player change their character freely like in every other modern game in this series. \n\nPortal is confusing and not as good as just having user servers. Also, the Portal search functionality, for whatever reason, is very finicky. I don't know, if I wanted to play these older Battlefield games, I'd just go boot them up with some fan mods, and not try to play some bastardized version of them through 2042.\n\nI've had the game crash on me at least 4 times in 12 hours of play. I might return to this in the future for the specific look and feel of 2042, but there are better Battlefield games - hell, there are OTHER Battlefield games."}

The stealth is much more enjoyable, and I like the leveling of guns and customization a lot more than in the second game where you needed luck basically. I can really recommend it, and I am very exciting for upcoming updates and DLCs. Hope they bring back more PAYDAY 2 maps to this game :D"}

So i look it up, read the comments and people talk about how they get blackscreens etc from it. I already played nearly 100 Hours without the need to do such extra steps that potentially messes up my pc. \n\nWhy do i have to do such extra work for a not even properly finished game.

Due to weekly lockouts, you will spend months soloing content nobody runs anymore before catching up to current endgame, where you will be gatekept - because game strongly encourages running 3 raids per week on 6 chars, people want fast clears and won't risk taking someone inexperienced as they really want their 18 weekly raids to take 30 minutes each rather than 3 hours each. If you endure, after a few months you can catch up, somewhat. You can also swipe to skip the grind, but being gatekept for no experience will still apply.\n\nGame is pay to win in the sense that it enables cash to in-game currency exchange. There's technically no advantage over other players that can be obtained exclusively by swiping, but paying enough can skip literal years of grinding, making you relatively stronger than players who spent less.\n\nIn short, game with amazing combat, great story - but badly translated and with mixed quality of voice acting, awful progression and equally bad, actively hostile new player experience."}

While the gameplay and foundations are solid here, (hell I'd even say quite fun and far superior) the problem is the direction for the future is unsettling. Greedy, ignorant shareholders are already kneecapping this franchise and until there's a dedicated no internet required offline mode to keep the game alive past pulling the plug on the servers no one will want to spend any real money on this. I would gladly change my review to a positive one if that one thing was done and throw cash at more content but until then I'm looking at this as a temporary experience, a huge letdown, and keeping my wallet closed."}

The raids are phenomenal. The music is outstanding, and the content of the game is extremely fun.\n\nHOWEVER: The developers of the game do not punish people who exploit the game left and right. It's a constant struggle for power. Everything is gatekept, and if you do not play all the time, you will fall behind. It's not something you can play casually. People constantly RMT, and the community is probably more toxic than WoW or even League of Legends. It's just not worth it. I have 1200 hours in the game, and I tried returning, I'm just too far behind. It's not worth it. Even with the ignite servers now, there are just too many issues."}

The bones of this game are great, better than PD2 I'd say. The mechanics, feel, and everything else are all there.  After the armor update the game is genuinely enjoyable to play a few rounds in. What's not great is the lack of content and the obvious abandonment from the devs, they've confirmed only a skeleton crew is working on the game now; the latest heist was made by 2 (two!) people. I genuinely believe this game has so much potential, moreso than PD2 had, but they just, gave up. Threw in the towel after a bad reception and low player count despite there being so much good to build upon. This game will likely stop receiving new content after this year, when their next game releases. 100% worth to grab on sale, but full price? Definitely not. RIP Payday."}

V’s struggle against the Relic chip isn’t just about survival—it’s a soul-shaking battle between humanity and technology. Side quests like \"Never Fade Away\" made me laugh, cry, and question what it means to be \"alive.\"\nCustomization That Defines Me‌\nChoosing the Street Kid lifepath shaped V’s grit, while my cyberware upgrades turned me into a walking experiment. Want to be a silent hacker or a bullet-spraying beast? The game lets you live out every cyberpunk fantasy.\nWorld That Breathes‌\nNight City isn’t a backdrop—it’s a character. Corporate ads taunt me in the rain, NPCs share secrets in back alleys, and every district pulses with its own rhythm. Here, I’m not just a player—I’m a citizen of a world that feels alive.\nVerdict: A Cyberpunk Masterpiece‌\nDespite its flaws, Cyberpunk 2077 is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

They basically annihilated Stealth builds, which were the best part about this game to begin with in comparison to Payday 2, and made it completely worse than Payday 2 in now every literal way. The masks and cosmetics are trash to begin with, and haven't gotten better. The game showed itself to be a shallow cash grab on release and all this time later it still is. They basically turned themselves into the payday crew to legally steal your money with false promises. Just play Payday 2 over this garbage if you want to go guns blazing. If you want stealth, you are stuck with this shallow pool of garbage water."}

I bought the game semi-recently as it went on sale and played through every heist in the game on overkill, but after that, there's really nothing left to do. It's sad cause the game is nearly a year old now, and there's maybe like an additional 2 free heists that've been added. The heists themselves aren't really that fun either (hate the wifi circles), feeling really uninspired and slapped together. There's not really much build variety since perk derks are gone and the skills are kinda wack, so I got bored pretty quickly. I do admit, I had fun when playing it for the first time, but there's not enough content or variety to keep that fun going."}

It's just not worth the headache of hundreds of hours to get to that point, just for you to see how bad it is.\n\nI'm done with it personally. Maybe one day things will change drastically, but until the playerbase completely bottoms out and folks stop spending money on gacha systems and slot machine rolls that exist in this game, that isn't happening.\n\nTl;dr  just don't. Avoid like the plague and play something better.\n\n\nEdit  wrote this before 2023 LOAON and china release\nMore censorship is coming down the line for CCP sensibilities.

I’m not the biggest fan of still having to pay for heists after launch but I have all the year one dlc’s and might get more since I’m a sucker. I pray that this game does a payday 2 and go through a comeback and become amazing. I love the payday franchise and want to see it succeed, so I can only give this game a slight thumbs up.

You have to keep on playing/grinding to keep up with the content and that's me playing an average of 5+ hours on work and 12+ hours on off work days. Literally did not touch grass when I was grinding on this game.

I enjoyed this game a lot. I took a long break from the game from around January to April. The only reason I came back was because three people I know finally were going to play this game after I tried for so long to get them to come play with me. They were having fun with the one character that they used the powerpass on and another one questing trying to level up. A few days ago when we had planned to play, they said they were banned because of apparently botting. When they appealed the ban, two of them were denied. These guys had the worst built characters to ever be accused of botting. Therefore I do not recommend this game to any new player.

While it is incredibly versatile, incredibly buggy and visually stunning it still in my eyes remains as a pretty cookie cutter 'Action-RPG' with nothing too interesting to boot. \n\nAn very vast and in-depth character creator and customization system...for a 95% first-person experience. Most you will see of your character besides during driving is with the shadows which are less than stellar.\n\nThe story branching into these multiple paths with your choices impacting the ending is not played smoothly. This isn't even to boot how the romantic options in the game are both limited and very stupid from a story perspective.\n\nNone of the games systems were explained well enough for me to take full advantage of them during the course of my gameplay.\n\nOverall Cyberpunk remains very fun and incredibly easy to access but I would not and never lord it as an incredible game. It was a bug-filled mess on launch and still wears those scars. It's still good in a pinch however, just incredibly middle of the road."}

I’ve been playing since Battlefield 2, and I’ve played all of them  except for Battlefield 5. I skipped that one because I didn’t like the beta and wasn’t going to pay for a game I knew I wouldn’t play.\n\nBut this one, Battlefield 2042, honestly… I played the beta, and it was terrible. I played for a month of EA’s subscription just to try it, and when the trial ended, I didn’t renew it because it simply wasn’t worth it. The game was incomplete at launch, the maps were bad, and there’s really not much to praise about it.\n\nSome people might like it, but as someone who’s played all the Battlefield games, there’s nothing here that stands out in a good way. I’ve got around 250 hours in it only because I bought it on sale for about 4 bucks, and I was grinding BF6 skins in Portal servers while AFK. That’s the truth.\n\nDon’t waste your time buying or playing this game. There are better ways to spend your time. If you want to play Battlefield, my opinion and just my opinion play Battlefield 6 or 4, or 3, or even Battlefield 1 if you like World War I settings. But this one, Battlefield 2042, really isn’t worth it."}

At First I didn't really enjoy it, maybe because it was so different from what I'd been used to, or maybe because I wasn't good. But once I continued to get a couple more hours in I started to like it. The gun play is smooth and fast, while also managing to feel semi realistic (unlike cod). If I had unlimited storage I would definitely continue to play even though I already own Battlefield 6. Even if Battlefield 6 is better game in almost every way, Battlefield 2042 is still a great game and an even better, cheap alternative."}

Some of that was patched later. But even now, the core problems are still there. The maps are too large and empty, matches feel chaotic instead of tactical, and teamwork matters far less than it used to.\n\nThe Specialist system is a big part of the problem. It removes clear class roles and turns Battlefield into something closer to a hero shooter, which just doesn’t fit this franchise. Instead of improving the formula, it waters it down.\n\nPost-launch support also feels late and reactive. Major fixes only arrived after a large part of the player base had already left, which makes it hard to trust the game as a long-term multiplayer experience.\n\nBattlefield 2042 may be more stable now than at launch, but “more stable” doesn’t mean “good.” It still doesn’t deliver the Battlefield experience many players expected.\n\nDo not buy this at full price. Even at a discount, know what you’re getting into. This feels less like a failed patch cycle and more like a failed direction."}

With the various changes throughout the months, AGS has managed to comeback with the new regional director (or similar title) matt. GIGACHAD.

The netrunner game mechanics are super fun, and the story is compelling, making you attached to characters and invested in the outcomes. \r\n\r\nAt times, the game almost becomes a movie, with interactive cutscenes that last 15 minutes.

You are frequently thrusted into the middle of some situation where it's difficult to understand your characters motivation for being involved, or the NPCs motivation for their actions. There are too many random side plot points that are hard to understand \r\n\r\nThe game is pretty dark which some people might not like, but I personally didn't mind it\r\n\r\nOverall, I would give this gamed an 8/10"}

I didn't just play the story; I was lived it, customizing cars, exploring deserts, and embracing the chaos that made it all unforgettable.\n\nSan Andreas is more than a masterpiece; it's a time capsule of laughter, freedom, and innocence. It reminds me of the GOLDEN DAYS when my heart - a timeless reminder of the joy of being young and free.\n\nStill grateful for those memories, and always will be.\n\nA forever-grateful player❤️"}

The story is cool, the skills are flashy, there's lots of side content, and the dungeons are challenging. But here's the problem. After 400 hours, I've played 95% of the game alone. There are virtually no players in T3, and it's designed so that you can play it alone because the developers know that you're completely on your own. I thought it would be better in T4 because it's “presumably” end-game content. Even there, I can't find any people, and if there is a party, you have to wait forever. I only see parties for end-end-game content, but until then, it's NOT an MMORPG just because you see some people in towns. And now comes the worst part: from T4 onwards, you realize that progress becomes difficult without the cash shop. I have nothing against progress becoming more difficult, but I haven't found a way to grind. All you can do are dailies and weeklies. And if you have to spend $500+ a month to get “the experience,” then it ultimately leads to Lost Ark being a mobile MMORPG light."}

They haven't put the Playstation controllers mapping on PC into the game after nearly 4 years with a crazy amount of copies sold. Another thing is that they don't care about people who do not live in English speaking countries because if you buy this game on Playstation outside of non-English countries, you might not even get to play the game in English version which makes it a big struggle for me to play with the weird ass translations in my Native language which is Thai. So I feel like the dev of this game doesn't really care much about feedbacks and are just lucky to have the fans protecting them all the time even on reddit (about the playstation controller mapping etc.) I see a lot of complaints on the languages too and still haven't received any changes since the release also."}

Battlefield 4 left us with Final Stand as a DLC and seeing a prototype Titan I was genuinely thrilled that 2042 possibly had a return of Titan mode... unfortunately with how the launch went and how EA treated this game, they definitely did it extremely dirty. Now, having been years later I will say that I do think the game has improved immensely, but... I'll admit I'm still rather salty we never got more direct usage of prototypes going into the futuristic warfare and losing the 64v64 game mode.\n\nI would still recommend the game as now all these years later it does feel like a battlefield game, but I could only really suggest it when it's on sale."}

DO NOT BUY THIS TRILOGY, it is a shitty mobile port that was rushed and has wayy to many issues. Furthermore this game has not received an update in years so its safe to say it is abandoned and will be left in this broken state forever.\nEdit: Even after trying this new update i still only needed 5 minutes to see that the game still is not the definitive way of playing these classics, as i said before it is a game that was meant for mobile devices and the graphics say it all, it looks even worse than the originals in my opinion and i strongly urge people to try and get their hands on the original games."}

Now it's cancelled. It's obvious why, it's not because it's \"not feasible\", it's because of greed, most likely.\n\nThey are capable of making offline work, as they already displayed in the \"BETA\" offline mode, but they just want certain things that they wouldn't able to do without making us play Online 24/7. If they gave a damn about their players, they would make sure Offline mode was going to happen. They've shown us they don't care."}

The only positves I have is that it works natively with a controller and can fill any size screen. Both of those things you can get out of the original with a small amount of modding. Which you will need to do to either game because of how bad the native map on the definitive edition is. It shows the full map of the first city, which is first give away of the lack of care given to the re port. As you go the map has less care shown to it and some things are censored or just missing because of the terrible AI paint job slapped on. Spots in the map that were fine in the original now have tree poking through the highway. Poor AI correction turns words that were low rez crown logos into crom. Just get the original and spend 5 minutes on Nexus making it look better than this soulless cash grab"}

It's REALLY worrying.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend this? yeah sure, buy it during discount seasons.\r\nWould I keep playing this? probably...

Sliding feels so dynamic and a nice, cool change from the usual shift-jump-crouch. The only complaint is this game is boring without friends and the damn Cloakers or whatever they are called after you enter hard mode; also the way the game sells an atrocious amount of DLC. This game isn't trash nor low effort, worth while it is on sale due to the DLCs. If the full game came without DLCs except maybe the licensed DLCs like Jacket and legacy heists that aren't apart of the overall story, it would be worth it at full price.\nExpanding on the annoying Cloakers, they won't at shoot you and prioritize kicking you down specifically if you play with AI, all you can do is watch your AI teammates run around trying to save you, and Cloakers are always present on the map no matter what, a normal heist will see you face 1 Cloaker per 10-15 seconds. Unless you play with friends you can't properly fight against Cloakers... and with the game having a bad reputation no casual player is willing to drop any money on the game unfortunately."}

Still, it's extremely nice to go Classic Conquest or Breakthrough after a long day, with only 63 bots and having all the progression stats being counted. \nI haven't played this game when it was launched, it caught my eyes when BF6 proved to be a terrible disappointment because of EA's stupid mentality of catering to COD players/streamers instead of caring about the game. They added tons of microtransactions and not just for cosmetics, also for better equipment. \nMaybe in some years when BF6 is old, I will play it like I'm utterly enjoying 2042 now."}

For once they didn't desaturate and make every environment as unpleasing to look at as possible. Before we take a wrecking ball to everything the maps look nice.\r\n+Gun play. The gunplay feels more like the far older battlefields except smoother. its actually more reliable and consistent. Your weapons don't feel quite so unpredictable like they do in the other more recent titles.\r\n\r\n-New Maps. The new maps are mostly terrible. Way to big and empty. They look nice, but play like garbage.\r\n-Vehicles. The vehicles are far to annoying in this title. There are way too many and the over sized maps grant them complete dominance."}

It has its bugs here and there, but the story still holds up to modern times (2025), and the upgraded graphics and control scheme really help make the game remain playable.\r\nNot to mention that some of the bugs can actually enhance the game slightly (such as the burglary money glitch)\r\n\r\nThe game engine is a bit buggy; the Rockstar engine can't handle above 147 fps, but I have experienced that with this game, above 138 fps creates graphical issues, and above 60 fps creates animation timing issues (cars moving to the wrong location when being driven by NPCs and the like). \r\n\r\nThis game plays quite nicely at 30 fps if you have a controller, so if you want the best experience, locking the game to 30 and playing with a controller will have the best playing result. \r\n\r\nOn a Radeon GPU, I would advise disabling all GPU enhancement features for the game since most of them conflict with the game engine, such as Enhanced VSync or Anti-Lag, which creates this really bad tearing effect in the game that is very distracting. Not sure if this is also the case on Nvidia GPUs."}

They butchered my favorite GTA game! Thanks guys!\nIn all seriousness, this one is not quite as bad as the other two. Don't get me wrong it fucking sucks. It's ugly, it messes with the art direction which leads to weird stuff throughout, the flying controls on PC are switched around from the original version [i.e. \"steer\" control (usually a and d) changes the yaw instead of the roll, and vice versa for the \"look left/right\" controls (usually q and e)]. I know that sounds nitpicky but considering how much flying I've done in the original it was really annoying to get used to that. Granted, the flying controls are actually all ASSIGNABLE in this game, unlike the other two, so that's nice. My standards are that low, I'm praising the game for having all the controls assignable! Anyway, tangent over, that's really all I've got to say without just writing an essay here. Fuck you Rockstar for replacing the original version with this garbage. Grove Street 4 Life"}

I've played it through fully twice, and each time my experience was different, as was my V. The way I interacted with characters, and the things I chose to do largely hinging on how I felt at the time. And players can do exactly that, choose what they want to do, whether it be to help or to fight the cops, to go in guns blazing or to use stealth, to make friends with characters, or ditch them. The game provides such a sense of freedom while still following a guided set of actions that lead to Cyberpunk's many endings. I'll focus specifically on my first run because it was the one I went into without any prior knowledge of the game. Overall, it was a run filled with options made because of opportunities not taken. Some because they never realized the options were there, and some because they didn't realize it was a better choice until it was too late. All of which is extremely human. It's one of the reasons I like this game. It's human. If you're someone who is really into games that match that description, \"Human\", then I'd bet Cyberpunk 2077 is for you."}

My main complaint is that they removed music from the original game that was released way back when i originally played these games on the PS2, however if you look hard enough you'll be able to find a mod that re-adds those removed songs. i found a link to them on reddit as they had since been removed from Nexus. Overall these games look really well with updated graphics in my opinion and still feel like they did when playing on the PS2. Some may say that this version of these games still suck, however i thoroughly enjoyed re-playing them while going for 100%. Would i purchase these games again?

Every NPC speaks in riddles, and I’m 90% sure half of them are gaslighting me. I met a guy with a pot for a head and trusted him more than any human in my real life.\r\nCombat is incredible.

When I tell you this is a game every gamer must experience at least once, I mean it. You got to hear this match I just had.

I reported and muted them of course :D I played the entire game absolutely fragging out and then on T side my tm8s gave me a molly and I know they want me to throw it so they can run in it and die so I smoke it and win the round. Last round comes and I'm going 16 kills 5 deaths, I throw a molly ramp and one of them kill me with an awp before I can smoke it and they all run in it, I get kicked, and then get a matchmaking cool down for doing too much team damage. This was by far the most funny moment I have had on this game and I'm not joking. I was drunk and couldn't stop laughing that basement dwellers like that exist along side me on this planet. Really makes me more confident and I think I'm going to get a promotion at work and another girlfriend after that experience ;)"}

It encourages unhealthy habits and isn’t worth the energy people put into it. Many players act like it’s their whole life, and that’s concerning. Instead of wasting time here, focus on something productive—work, relationships, or personal growth.\n\nThe developers clearly don’t care about quality or the community. The game feels poorly designed, unbalanced, and driven by greed rather than creativity. Bugs, exploits, and hackers are ignored, while monetization is pushed aggressively. Progress often feels locked behind paywalls instead of skill or effort.\n\nThere’s no real future in investing time or money into this. The gameplay loop is repetitive, frustrating, and unrewarding, and the player experience keeps getting worse instead of better. This could have been a good game with proper effort and respect for players, but as it is now, it’s a disappointment."}

A ambientação cyberpunk é muito bem feita, tudo tem personalidade, desde os becos até os prédios gigantes cheios de neon\r\n\r\nA história me prendeu demais. As missões principais são muito boas e as secundárias surpreendem, várias parecem até missão principal de tão bem escritas. Os personagens são marcantes, principalmente o Johnny Silverhand, que acaba virando uma presença constante e bem interessante durante o jogo.\r\n\r\nO gameplay é bem livre. Dá pra jogar no stealth, sair hackeando tudo, ou meter o louco no tiroteio. Conforme você vai upando e colocando implantes, o personagem fica cada vez mais forte e divertido de jogar. A sensação de progressão é muito boa.\r\n\r\nHoje dá pra dizer que Cyberpunk 2077 finalmente virou o jogo que prometeram. Recomendo demais pra quem curte mundo aberto e uma história bem feita."}

There are some differencies I don't like, for example biking works differently, melee fighting is more 'modern' with lock in, but that makes it worse and Idk what it is, some missions seems much more easier than in original, but might be just a feeling. I'll personally stick with original SA, don't think I'm ever gonna touch this version. There are many more things I like more in original or are missing in the remaster, but the review would be too long."}

Oh and the combat is so deep because u could make so many different builds or just ditch it and go for drip that you can master anything from lightning-fast claws to massive gravity magic whilst wearing the toughest fit on. The story also isnt just a boring cutscene its this massive, tragic puzzle hidden in item descriptions and ruins that makes you feel like a detective in a fantasy apocalypse and once i actually took the time to read up and study it i was more immersed in the game icl made it more enjoyable. yea and i dont think i need to talk about the graphics and design. 10/10 peak"}

This games used to be the bees knees ngl, overwatch one back in the day was a great time and I think a lot of us stick around for the nostalgia at this point. \r\nThis game really shines with cooperative team play utilizing comms but the way the community has devolved at this point most have resorted to full muting all text chats and not joining voice even in ranked games while profiles are default on full private. playing this game solo is exhausting and I have noticed a concerning increase of blatant cheating.

There's a huge difference between a game designed to be fun, and a game designed to be engaging, and I feel like a lot of people struggle to understand that. Lost Ark's business strategy is literally create a problem to sell a solution. I'm convinced everyone who still plays it just has Stockholm syndrome, because that's what it felt like to me in hindsight. Once I finally got off for longer than a week, the only feelings I could ascribe to the whole experience was a sensation akin to finding out someone I'd been hanging out with was only around to get me to buy things for them."}

It was great for the first few matches, but then it just...got stale. The new heists they keep coming out with are DLC heists and I really hate spending cash on a game that I've already spent $30 on when the extra content is just going to be enjoyed for a few days max. I say don't bother with the game if you don't want to be disappointed after 5 heists"}

So instead of an amazing game we're stuck with just a very exceedingly okay game. It's not bad, but I can't recommend it as long as this keeps happening. Just go Payday 2 with mods or even Crime Boss instead. At least those will still be playable ten years from now."}

Five seconds later you whiff an entire mag and start blaming ping, teammates, and life in general.\n\nMatchmaking is a social experiment. One teammate thinks it’s Faceit, one is playing with music on, and one just discovered WASD. But when the team clicks? Pure cinema. Clutches still make your heart stop, comebacks feel illegal, and winning a close game hits harder than it should.\n\nIs it balanced? Sometimes. Is it stressful? Always.

To anyone.\n\nI love this game, I've loved this game since I started playing it, but the only real way to play it now is to join the very limited amount of community servers with specific rulesets that aren't the vanilla game or don't run the standard maps in rotation.\n\nValve has left the game in a borderline unplayable state since Meet Your Match released and have done little to nothing to fix it. Casual mode (and by extension Competitive mode) are horribly buggy messes that should have never been introduced into the game. A matchmaking system is entirely antithetical to what Team Fortress 2 is; a casual pick-up put-down first person shooter. Until this issue is addressed, my review will remain negative.\n\n#YouWillNotPlay"}

I played about 15 minutes, got so frustrated with how difficult it was, and never played again. After 3 years I randomly decided to try again, and I think this is now in my top five favorite games ever. It has completely rewired how I play video games, and has helped me get through a very dark time in my life. It deserves all the praise its gotten for sure. I'm glad I tried again."}

There's a solid roster of fun classes to play and raids are very well crafted. Honestly, the story isn't half bad either. Definitely worth a try with all the new updates but don't expect a social experience."}

It did not have a smooth launch, as I recall it myself (we bought the game, trailers looked great, nobody knew the terrible condition). \r\n\r\nThat being said, they have turned it around. It runs decent, feels as good as the old pc ports with quality of life improvements, and looks really nice. The unreal engine was not a bad choice here.\r\n\r\nArt style and character models were not the right direction and that's my main criticism. Some areas look like an unreal engine tech demo and not in line with the original 3D era GTA games.\r\n\r\nOther than that, these are pretty much exactly what I was looking for. I like the simple fun of the classics a lot more sometimes, and these get pretty much everything down. Any missing content you need, just mod it back in. Otherwise I'm happy with it.\r\n\r\nDon't get it for base price. Only get it on sale."}

I did not necessarily like Elden Ring in the beginning, in fact, I returned it the first time I bought it. But over time, I was able to appreciate the deep lore, game content, diversity of builds, and pure creativeness that is in the players hand for how they want to play the game. Initially that can feel daunting, especially with many large AAA titles quite literally spoon feeding you content on a monorail around a theme park. \r\n\r\nElden Ring does quite the opposite. It will feel overly punishing in the beginning, but turn into a fruitful experience in the end appreciating a game that is complete upon release but lets you find out what it has to offer, and beat it how you want to beat it"}

Has some weird input lags so I had to dance with ChatGPT for a couple of hours but couldn't fix it all the way.\n\nSometimes cars disappear right in front of you, not when you look away, like in the original.\n\nThey changed NPC looks for some reason. So it's harder to spot some kinds of Ballas, and especially police officers. They used to wear distinctive black uniforms, now it's grey so they blend in.\n\nUPD:\nNew flight controls with the mouse suck.

The early experience delivered unpredictable moments and ridiculous vehicle plays that everyone loved, even if it wasn’t polished.\n\nA few months later the patches toned things down. The vehicle changes removed a lot of that launch-era craziness, and while the gunplay was decent, it felt more arcade-like and less true to classic Battlefield roots. After that, I stepped away from the game for about a year.\n\nComing back right before BF6 released, the game was in a much better place. It felt more balanced, more stable, and surprisingly captured the Battlefield vibe well enough to hold me over until the next game dropped. Overall, Battlefield 2042 became a solid stepping stone for the series—rough start, but it eventually grew into a fun, respectable experience."}

There are also some cool encounters but you have huge issues getting into groups, so you might as well consider this game not having them in the first place. After taking everything into account, all that is left in this game is chores."}

I just recently redownloaded the game after armor 2.0 and so far its been fun. The buff to enemy AI seems good, giving players much more challenge in higher difficulties, Armor 2.0 adds much more build depth/variety, so overall its not bad right now although far from perfect. I do however have some small problems like the reduced ammo pickup, i feel like it can be harsh on some weapons especially the weaker ones like SMGs on Overkill difficulty, they chew through ammo and get 4 bullets back per box. Ammo bags does, of course fix this but still, with Crew AI sometimes putting ammo bags out in the open, its not always easy trying to get back ammo, especially if you use an entire clip just to break dozer visors/kill a dozer. But again, overall, I like where the game is right now.\n\nEdit: Literally right after writing this review Crew AI phases through the ground and gets stuck, they cant shoot or move, they do however drop armor/medic/ammo bags but since they're underground, i cant get them... Still recommend the game if you plan to play with others though."}

It is a fun game with vivid and fantastic artistic designs and visuals through the different continents in the game. If you can manage to get a group of friends or find a very active guild finding group content is a lot funner until you get to end game which is the largest grind fest since you need to use alts in order to farm mats, gold, and other resources to funnel to your main to get your gear and items to where you need them to access end game meta builds. Overall I enjoyed the experience of the worlds story and art with the combo of making your own builds along the way."}

When I first played it, it felt unfinished and I was honestly a bit disappointed, especially given all the hype. I played it through once and then stopped. I went back to it about a year or so later and found it had improved massively. Night City feels alive and full of personality, and I found myself just cruising around and taking it all in. The story pulled me in more than I expected, with some genuinely great characters and moments that stick with you. The gameplay is decent and gives you plenty of different ways to complete missions. I’ve found that character skills also play a big role in how the game plays. Visually, the game looks great, especially at night. One of my main gripes is that the NPCs feel a little lacking compared to some other games, but that’s relatively minor. In the end, it turned into an amazing game and I’m glad I gave it another go."}

The wonderous feeling of exploring is wonderful to all players, and the challenge is something to overcome that gives you a sense of gratitude. I will be playing more of this game, as I have beaten Dark Souls 3 and loved every second of it. Hats off to you, Fromsoftware, for bringing this amazing experience. I would gladly pay 200 dollars for this game. Play it now, especially if it is still on sale. All challenges can be overcome, whether your skilled or not, as you can find ways throughout the open world to get against these challenges effectively."}

The fact Starbreeze is release paid DLC for an incomplete game is wild to me, but it just feels in line with what we have come to expected from companies now a days.\n\nThe game can be very fun, but the original heists are so tiny and rubbish, that you NEED to buy the DLC ones to get enjoyment from the game. \n\nWould still recommend PD2 over this. \n\nMay 12th 2024:\nOnly reason I didnt refund the game was because Im holding out Starbreeze will start listening to the community and fix the game. \n\nIf this game interests you then dont buy it, buy Pay Day 2 instead will all the DLC, its a more fleshed out game with better content. Even the earlier missions of PD2 are better than any mission in PD3. Maps feel smaller and less interesting/fleshed out than PD2 maps. Missions are basically all the exact same BS with no character to them.\n\nThis game feels like they took everything great about the Pay Day series and threw it out the window to modernize it. \nUnless they fix the game and gameplay, Id stay 100ft away"}

However, the absence of single-player legion raids for normal difficulties could be a missed opportunity. Implementing this feature would address the desires of players who prefer to experience content solo without compromising the existing group raid mechanics.\n\nAdding single-player legion raids on normal difficulties would also benefit new players who may be hesitant to engage in group content early on. It would serve as a stepping stone, allowing them to hone their skills, learn raid mechanics, and gear up before venturing into more challenging group raids.\n\nFurthermore, solo legion raids could offer an alternative way for players to experience the lore and unique encounters at their own pace, providing additional depth and engagement to the game's solo gameplay."}

Combat is plastic-ky and buggy.  Stealthing feels awful. Vehicle shooting is just one big bug and genuinely enrages me every time I have to go through it.\r\n\r\nHow is the game getting good review is beyond me, this is simply unacceptable. Make an adventure game like Quantic Dream games and dont pretend this game is anything other than barely interactable movie....with bugs."}

When I first heard about it coming out, I was super excited to play, But that quickly turned around. The customization compared to Payday 2 is extremely minimal which is surprising because Payday games were partially famous because of their wide range of weird customization combo's. Also, there are so little heists -not to mention they get boring very quickly. and the thing that I missed the most was the crazyness of the heists, they feel so empty in Payday3, while in Payday2, the heists were a total mayhem which never made a heist boring no matter how many times you played it. To summarize it, this game does have good graphics which is a plus point, but by far never enough to compensate for the complete bullshit the rest of the game is on.  Do.Not.Buy. Not even on sale."}

Payday: The Heist on PS3 was an absolute banger, and Payday 2 became one of the best co-op shooters of all time. I own most of the DLC, have over 100 hours across flat screen and VR, and it’s been nothing but excellence. Then came Payday 3…\n\nTo say I’m disappointed is an understatement. Starbreeze had the chance to deliver one of the greatest sequels ever, but fell short in almost every way. Day 1 was a mess — constant issues, online only restrictions, and unstable servers. The map selection was tiny and mechanics were janky. Now in 2025, little has changed. Instead of meaningful content, we’ve seen pathetic DLCs dropping and almost no substantial updates.\n\nPayday 3 feels less like a sequel and more like a downgrade. Unless something drastic changes, I don’t see Starbreeze recovering from this monumental failure."}

The nostalgia is hitting hard with this one though. I just picked it up yesterday so I only have a few hours on it but in the last two play sessions I've had I've actually enjoyed my time quite a bit. The menu and lobby system is a bit weird. I'm not a fan of the constant reminders in game, but I also don't mind it too much either. I mean seriously. For $9 you get payday 2 but with modern graphics and interfaces. Also I have no idea if the in game voice chat even works. I've enabled it but haven't ran into anyone else using a mic yet."}

The visual upgrades really help, everything looks cleaner and smoother without losing that old-school vibe.\n\nThe story still hits, the gangsta atmosphere in Los Santos is as fun as ever, and the missions are just as good as I remembered. Gameplay holds up surprisingly well even after all these years. Throw in a few mods, and you’ve got something legendary.\n\nIf you played it before, it’s definitely worth coming back to. And if you’ve never played it – what the hell are you doing? This is a piece of gaming history.\n\nStill one of my favorite games of all time. Fully recommend it."}

This limits my freedom and enjoyment. Payday 2 set a high bar for weapons and customization, and it's disappointing to see this aspect fall so short. other than that im very happy with all other aspects of the game. the graphics are good and the sound design is awesome. I'm gonna keep playing it though in hopes that this gets fixed and they take the NMS approach not the Sony approach."}

Most talks about the game now are what could of been if \"X wasn't monetized\". They have jump starts coming up. Which will re merge back into the horridly p2w server economy within 3 months. I got an email from amazon to complete a lost ark survey and it gave me the details. Such wasted potential.\n\nPeople are waking up a bit more then they used to. Forcing games like this to die or straighten out their monetization. Lost Ark is going the dying route VS just making the game proper.\n\nIt was fun until I hit level 50 though. You might get enjoyment up to that point. Then all gear gets liquidated into a honing system and there isn't any cool armours or anything. Just a few different sets that get bigger stats with honing. The game gets really bad at end game. Its just running the same thing over on several characters then logging off. It stops your loot drops if you keep playing.

I took off from work, got all my buddies to play....\n\nAnd was immediately let down. I was expecting a long story campaign, and it was long alright, but for all the wrong reasons. It was just a janky mess, with busted cut scenes, 1hp open world enemies and 1M hp dungeon enemies. It was constant whiplash.\n\nThen you get to the the meat of the content, the repeatable stuff you do for gear... and it's just BAD. It never explains anything to you. Just \"okay, this is unlocked now, have fun!\" \n\nEvery inch of this game is pay to win garbage. Covered in content designed to be not fun unless you pay for stuff.\n\nAnd lets not get started on the \"community\" around this game. Almost worse than League Players. In the earliest trials, there were people rage quitting groups because someone didn't know the mechanics ON THEIR VERY FIRST RUN. Also like 40% of the players are just bots. For most of my time playing the game I ran into more bots than people, and the people I did run into were incredibly toxic and nasty.\n\nDO yourself a favor and stay away, the cool combat isn't worth the rest of everything."}

Playing the Definitive Edition just brings back all those old memories, but now with way better graphics. Everything looks cleaner and more detailed, but it still feels like the same game I grew up with.\r\n\r\nFor me, this is the best GTA ever when it comes to story. CJ’s whole journey, the family drama, the gang stuff, it all just hits different. There are so many moments that stick with me even after all these years.\r\n\r\nEven though it’s an old game, the Definitive Edition makes it feel fresh again without losing what made it special in the first place. To me, it’s still unbeatable."}

I play it on a laptop not meant for gaming and so there was the added difficulty of a pretty bad pc port which has very slow input lag and control drift, in addition to stuttering and whatnot, but enemies and bosses are mostly doable as long as they are predictable. Once I got a controller, everything became much easier due to more responsive controls and whatnot, even on this potato laptop.\r\n\r\nSome critiques:\r\n1. Some of the level and arena designs are quite poor in that they present difficulties unrelated to the game mechanics but are purely technical such as giant bosses in tiny arenas which lead to cameras constantly clipping into the walls and the boss itself\r\n2. These poor design issues combine with poor controls to create situations where you are really fighting against your own PC and camera rather than the boss itself, which can be a challenge in itself but not the enjoyable point of this game.\r\n\r\nAll in all, still a very enjoyable game with an actual challenge."}

The end game is extremely grindy though. (Upgrading gear and increasing item level in order to unlock more content and get to the late game other islands.)\n\nI enjoyed the level 1-50 experience, playing through some of the early and mid game areas and progressing through the story. Pretty story rich watching the cut scenes and listening to the voiced dialogue through the main quests.\n\nI haven't made really any progress in end game after hitting level 50 besides the free powerpass that they gave out. The player does get 1 or 2 free power passes when they complete the main story up to level 50. Which allow you to boost a character to level 50 and get to the beginning of end game. Which is nice, but the game just gets so grindy after that with RNG gear leveling. \n\nFun to try out. Would recommend for that."}

So many things lost from Payday 2 when coming into this game, you question what's the point of a sequel when it has less content and its worse overall.\n\nI won't go into detail given the countless negative reviews commenting on how this game sucks, so I'll just comment on my least favorite aspect of this game.\n\nThe cop animations are vastly inferior than Payday 2. In that game, cops reacted in a multitude of ways depending of the angles they're shot from. They would occasionally trip and fall, spending time to regain their footing. If shot on the back, they would throw their arms in surprise and fall forward. They even have an unique animation if you shot them in the balls. That energy is sorely missing in Payday 3. They brush off bullets as if they were airsoft pallets. They don't even throw themselves on the floor anymore to escape line of fire, they just occasionally sidestep and ragdoll on death.\n\nNo matter how much they rework Payday 3's skill or armor system like how they've been trying to do for over two years (holy fuck), this level of detail and energy on the cops is something we'll never see again."}

The gunplay feels random and unrewarding. Damage is inconsistent and if you ADS and start shooting too fast the weapon is inaccurate as well.   Even with good latency you still get killed when you have already reached cover. No real server browser, the matchmaking system puts you in games that are about to finish. The maps are super diverse and there are only a couple of 'fun' ones.

It's a serious problem as population of players is artificially replicated meaning not likely for there to be any server merging anytime soon unless Amazon Games and Smilegate do something about all the bots. If you have 3 other friends you can play with everytime youre on you can make it work as a 4 player coop game but other than that good luck to you as I haven't even been able to get into raids or dungeons without bots just shooting at random due to their scripting causing a severe lack of damage and ruining the fun of the game and increasing the already harsh difficulty of grinding for gear level.

Glad they felt the need to add a almost uncounterable vehicle to the game that is already often dominated by helicopters, because counterplay isnt the core of battlefield or anything. Glad the devs seem to be making better moves but they were beyond moronic with 2042. This dumb free pass event that has a bunch of reused assets has done nothing but remind how horrifically bad the devs can and will fuck up their games. IF you guys screw up bf 6 i hope you get canned by your new owners."}

Its better in 75% of all ways. \nPayday 3 wins out in the perk trees being more robust and useful. Other than that Crimeboss has better maps better gameplay more modes and weapons. \n\nUNLESS YOU ACHIEVEMENT HUNT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNLOCK LATER UNLOCKS. The only way you can level up is by getting achievements not just general gameplay. It is the most antigamer progression system in a game. It forces you to play in ways you do not find fun or use weapons you do not want to use to be able to level up. Makes replay ability almost pointless. \n\nDo yourself a favor play crimeboss rockay city. And if you are really that bored then maybe buy this game on a 90% sale if only to negative review it so the dev will fix their game, tho I doubt it."}

However, the 5th and 6th gates individually can take hours for pug group if raid wipes are constantly triggered. 15 minutes of raid time just wasted if the last few mechanics are failed."}

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The community gives them a pass for their crappy systems and saying time gating, rng in honing, and horizontal content is \"hard work\". Raids are fun, but don't expect to play the current raids with your friends even with all the free stuff that they give. The guys who say you can catch up in a month from scratch no life this game and are currently in divorce proceedings. If they just made it easier to even get to the normal mode of the latest raid/dungeon I don't think it would be an issue. Think of it as getting to the normal mode of the latest raid in WoW or FFXIV and working towards the harder content. Grinding older raids for 2-4 months before you even get to normal mode sucks. And if someone says \"well alts keep the game fresh and you can push your main with it\". That's not the issue, if you can push your main with only your main it would make for a much healthier game, then people can play alts only if they want to with the rewards just being mats. Also don't tell me we need pheons here to control the economy - they need to fix the core of their progression system instead."}

Can play multiple different classes and they do give us many ways to get them up to par with your main. Raids are all pretty fun, especially in call with your friends. Only issue is that they take relevant issues such as disconnects and things that actually affect players in a non-serious manner and their own mistakes that benefit the players as urgent issues that require emergency maintenance. I wouldn't recommend this game if you care about how it is managed, but getting a character up isnt too difficult anymore."}

I hope they do radical changes like this every year to keep people into the game.   I see quite a few negative reviews.  Anyone who wants no change but is willing to play for 30 years can go back and play the WC3 with the mod, that thing is frozen in time forever.\n\nI have to admit the game is starting to wane with me too, but thats not because of the changes.

The graphics? Smoother. The city? Bigger than my attention span. The nostalgia? Hits harder than Big Smoke’s order at Cluckin’ Bell.\n\nYou play as CJ, a man who just wanted to go home but instead got dragged into a whirlwind of gang wars, corrupt cops, and driving across the entire state just to deliver a pizza. It’s freedom, chaos, and comedy rolled into one—basically a life simulator if your life included jetpacks and chainsaws.\n\nThe remaster makes everything look cleaner, but the heart of San Andreas is still the same: stealing cars, ignoring the main story for hours, and wondering if you should go to the gym or just eat 40 burgers. Spoiler: it’s the burgers.\n\nBy the time I finished, I wasn’t just playing a game—I was reliving a piece of gaming history. It’s the rare remaster that makes you feel like a kid again while still reminding you that you’re way worse at flying planes than you remembered.\n\n10/10.

Most of the guns you'll encounter are meta weapons since they really have a big advantage over some of the weaker guns. Take the PP as an example.\nPlay this game if you like large scale battles.

The game has potential to come back like no mans sky if they put more work into it they can make it work also dont use grenade launcher near civies even with the upgrade where it doesnt kill them total bs will still kill them. also devs please add more control over ai so i can have an ai press a button while i use a keycard to open a damn vault instead of the lobotomite team mates. other than that if this game can fix its issues add some original payday content move out of new york and do more payday content and not have a crazy ending like we did in two we might make this game a goty for 26"}

It's like the second part, but the graphics are better. I'm playing it on low settings, even though my graphics card is decent. It still slows down like it's some kind of crap.\n\nMy recommendations:\n1. Remove the mandatory registration. In the post-Soviet space, the game doesn't work without a VPN, as the internet is blocked or slowed down.\n2. Provide free content.\n3. Improve the solo mode or combine single-player and online modes into one, like in the second part. This is because the game crashes due to the mandatory internet connection.\n\nI hope that by 2026,"}

This is definitely a flawed game with p2w but long-time players play despite the issues because the raid gameplay is just that good. The other parts of the game will provide a few hundred hours of gameplay but they're not nearly as engaging as the raids. \n\nMany of the problems that plagued Lost Ark in its early years have been alleviated or solved. For example, chaos dungeons and guardian raids are only once a day, raids are generally only two gates (compared to the old Brelshaza raid that had 6 gates), and alts aren't necessary to play the latest raids. However, the content is timegated weekly so people typically make more alts to play more. Gatekeeping is still present but is alleviated for new/returning players with the mokoko bootcamp that gives veteran players an incentive to bring newbies to raids. There are also revives available in raids and progressive nerfs to raid boss HP/damage so the pressure during week to week reclearing has been greatly reduced.\n\nNow is a great time to start or return to the game with the recent progression events and Paradise system that aids progression."}

There are plenty of half baked synergies presented to the player but in truth there are only a handful of viable builds. So many are distractions that should be ignored. Stacking a 2.5% bonus, or in some cases 0.05% bonus 5 times does not present an opportunity to base your build on that. Same goes for \"cool\" sounding combat loops that are impractical for 90% of scenarios.  For instance if there are mitigation perks & bonuses then I expect to construct a full build around mitigation and if I stack everything correctly it should be as powerful as having full armour + max health. \r\n\r\nThe synergies are too weak, and most wearable items DO NOT PLAY INTO IT AT ALL!!. Missed opportunity to say the least. Ridiculous. Learn from games like Underrail where they got everything right.\r\n\r\nBy end game you can end up having 15+ in all attributes which cheapens your RPG efforts. \r\n\r\nAlso do not appreciate the overall dystopian & unrealistic presentation of a corp led world, but that could be source material related.\r\n\r\nMusic is also pretty bad, only like 5 good tracks on the radio."}

The story, while kinda goofy is enjoyable in some parts!\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is honing is the progression system and boy is it aggrivating, if you don't wanna spend money you gotta grind for a few days to attempt to hone an item. Oh it's like a 2% chance to upgrade? well pony up some cash or keep grinding. It sucks that f2p is so held back but I understand it's the play model they're choosing. \n\nOverall it's a 5/10 great boss fights and fun mechs but the end game progression sucks. Perhaps it's changed but with POE2 out I don't see a reason to go back."}

Literally unplayable during the day due to the amount of people and the fact they made it online only.\nIt's taken a little bit but I haven't had any issues lately and the game isn't super buggy.\n\nMy only real negative about the game is that sometimes objectives are kinda obscure when they should be right in front of you. It took me like 20 minutes to find the box to lower the bollards (i forgot which mission) when it should've been fairly obvious with the amount of action taking away from being able to search for it.\n\nBut the game is super fun, not quite up to par with what we expected of a PAYDAY 2 successor but the heists are engaging, the game feels good, everyone misses Bain but he had a good send off and Shade seems like a good stand in.\n\n\n AND THEY BROUGHT BACK WOLF"}

Done the battlepass on time and it scratched my BF itch until BF6 drops soon. \n\nJust hope we see more level-lution stuff like in BF4. Oh yeah, I hope I can get an LMG with a grenade launcher.

You can fall behind pretty quickly, and it got to a point where I couldn't afford to gear up my main (bard) and definitely couldn't afford to gear up an alt. Too tempting to swipe to keep up with everyone else and get accepted to raids and too grindy to maintain even one character."}

The level design is genius. You don’t just walk across a map; you scale jagged peaks, descend into rotting catacombs, and traverse floating ruins. Every time you think you’ve seen it all, you find a hidden elevator that leads to a starlit underground city or a secret path that opens up a continent-sized region you didn't know existed.\n\nBuild wise, the experimentation is pretty much endless as well.

The free updates are great throughout the year, but it's too late. I will never forget I couldn't even be a proper engineer and have both an rpg and blowtorch. A sniper with infinite ammo and heals was also stupid. Most core maps sucked, only good ones are recycled from previous games. \n\nThis game needs to be a reminder what not to do on release. When you try to pander to more people copying silly trends, you end up pandering to no one and not even the original fanbase is interested. A concrete vision and principles are needed otherwise the mix of foreign mechanics deviating from the core identity ruins it for everyone. The devs tried to justify their logic and they paid harshly for it. Don't fuck it up in BF6 with some demented \"vision.\" Keep locked weapon classes. Saw a sniper with a carbine on the Assault class in BF Labs, dumbest shit ever. This ain't CoD or Fortnight."}

I'm looking more to the company being greedy now under new management or something, I can't blame the dev's that have no say in the direction.

The bad part is that the game design is to gatekeep players so hard at the endgame. For me, when I quit and if I come back, no one will want to play with me because you will fail the mechanics on new raid bosses or you're not geared enough and anger everyone since no one wants to waste their time failing over and over. Also, this game is a grindfest/P2W, and when you reach the endgame, it becomes quite boring to do the same crap over and over."}

I won't deny that Payday 3 still needs more time, but after catching it on sale... I figured I'd give it a shot, and surprisingly the year I turned my interest away from Payday as a whole ended up making this game somewhat enjoyable. Janky, but quite enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWhile I miss Simon Viklund's music, Gustavo really was allowed to cook, and man am I here for it! \r\nFor the time being, I give the game a 6/10. Some may view the game as a disappointment, but Payday 2 didn't exactly have a great track record for a long while after release, so I'm going to sit back and do what the Cook Off Soundtrack says to do: Let Them Cook."}

Night City is astonishing and really feel like one day I will explore each corner of all the buildings just for fun.\n\nI don't know what else to add considering I am still at the beginning of the story but I really loved each moment. What left a huge hole is the Isometric Air soundtrack that plays right before the Konpeki Plaza heist. Since the first second I was in the car with Jackie and heard it I knew something big was about to happen. Then heard it again during the elevator scene and all I wanted is to go outside on the balcony and listen to it while admiring the view. Haven't had such a feeling in a long while. Good job, CDPR.

Not only did it run smoothly, but CD Projekt Red patched it so well that i could no longer see any cracks. The world is incredible, with deep lore, insane humor, and moments that genuinely made me stop and think, “Wow…this is one of those games.” \n\nAfter all the patches and updates, this game went from disappointment to an absolute must-play."}

The game felt unfinished and directionless. But as time went on and the developers kept updating it, the experience slowly started to grow on me. While it never reached the memorable heights of Battlefield 3 or Battlefield 4, 2042 eventually found its footing. Still, it always felt like the odd one out, kind of like Battlefield Hardline. Now that it’s reached the end of its life cycle, I can say Battlefield 2042 served its purpose. It was never meant to be the next great Battlefield, even though it was hyped as one. In the end, it feels more like a stepping stonea placeholder that gave DICE time to prepare for what fans truly wanted, which we’re finally getting with Battlefield 6.\r\n 2042 ended up being... alright. Not great, not terrible, just a chapter in Battlefield’s evolution."}

Some fight inside buildings, others drive tanks or fly helicopters. The fights are strong, and the situation can change in a few seconds. Sometimes the weather makes it hard to see or forces players to move, which makes the game more exciting. The game gives a lot of freedom. You can play aggressively, help your team, or act alone.

The glitches seems to be more controlled than the original release back in 2020 or 21 don't remember. But over all I'll just give this game a 6/10 at most because of my problems with the npc's and the driving. Even the 2004 game npc's didn't do this BS too me. But I'll still recommend only when it's on sale cause 60$ is too much for 3 broken games."}

Game literally tells you to do your adventure island for rewards to help upgrade your gear, only to then have islands be locked behind having a certain song or emote. Look up how to get said song or emote and then you go on a goose chase across various things just so you can wait for that adventure island to come back up again.

Played the Battlefield 6 BETA which is laughably better than whatever this is. Will play the Battlefield 6.....but I'm uninstalling this. land vehicle gameplay is the best of it and some of the maps are good (NOT all of them), but even having said that you cant see when vehicles are going to become available again after they're destroyed, and any jets/choppers/anything in the air they make far too difficult to use....as a result most don't ever bother with them which is just sad. on the infantry side - I think the recoil is far too unforgiving, whereas I think BF6 BETA struck a great balance. I feel a lot of the weapons are fairly unusable until they get specific attachments which is just plain wrong to me."}

There needs to be an increased difficulty option, just like one down in Payday 2.\n\nStealth is also ridiculously hard on overkill compared to Payday 2 where you could just breeze through maps on Death sentence, one down.\n\nI still like the game, but i am hoping that the bugs get fixed and new content with more maps come out soon."}

Sure there are some valid complaints coming from real bf heads out there but man most of what I see is straight bitching. The game is a decent battlefield game. Not the best and not Hardline. \n\nMy experience is that I avoided this game for the majority of its life until after the BF6 beta. After I played the beta I wanted more BF. So the logical next option was this game and wouldn't ya know it, it was on sale for a whoppin' 3 bucks. I told my friends to get it and we been jammin ever since. Probly not gonna finish the battlepass for the BF6 shit but we've had fun and its been a great baseline if you will for what we can expect in BF6. \n\nFrom my perspective, this game is not terrible and does not deserve the hate that it gets, generally. I wouldn't pay full price but at any discount this is a decent shooter. Not that it matters much anyways since BF6 is right around the corner, but I wanted to say my piece."}

And the bigger issue is no one tells you why they wont even invite you, so you dont know what you need to fix.

I've been playing Dota 1, both online and offline, and it took some time before I tried Dota 2. But when I tried Dota 2, I immediately decided to stick with the game.\n\nFor Dota 1 players, you will find transitioning from Dota 1 to Dota 2 quite easy since Dota 2 is very much like Dota 1 although significantly improved. The game is as exciting as Dota 1 since players will have to use their wits and skills to beat their opponents in battle. \n\nThis game will test not only your hand and eye coordination but also your ability to make quick decisions and good strategies. And because you will have to work with different players in your team with varying personalities, you will ultimately learn or acquire valuable traits like patience, leadership and the quality of being a teamplayer.\n\nTherefore, for me, this game deserves 5 stars!"}

I liked the crazy cracked builds and hostage takers, broken ass passives, active skills etc. The skills and the passives are REALLY dumbed down here. Like there is literally no depth. But the swap from the abomination that was the Diesel engine to a proper game engine that can handle... you know... GUNS feels like a fever dream. They feel awesome, animations are snappy and thonky. The hitreg is awesome. Cops don't have 2 animations for being hit. The hitmarkers are very clean which helps the hit feel a lot. \n\nI hated stealth. I still do. But this game, they made it so much more interesting with a brand new gadget slot, unmasked gameplay, several new interaction animations, CQC with hostage grabbing etc. Makes for some fun times. I still go loud as soon as I can tho.\n\nBe mindful that i got the game and a few dlc's on a massive discount, it made me remember the good old times and hope for its better future. I still want to go back and play Payday 2 but god forbid that game engine. Do me a solid one Overkill and cook a great game. You have good potential."}

Why is this game still riddled with bugs and other issues? The quality of life improvements like the weapon wheel and the updated GPS are nice for sure, but they don't make the purchase of the game feel worth it when it's objectively an inferior version compared to the original release. I bought this game on sale for 30 dollars (its still full price as of this review) and its still not cheap enough for the quality that you're paying for. Its a shame they delisted the original version of the game off steam because that's the version you should still be buying and playing. I can't recommend this version of the game if you already own the original. Genuinely this game should be 5 dollars because that's all I'd pay for it."}

This game has incredible world building to it, with amazing boss fights, Lore, seamless Co-Op and Graphics. I did not expect too much from this game and expected it to not be any different from any DS game, but when i first played it on console, it exceeded my expectations.\r\n\r\nWhen i first started i knew what to expect from a Fromsoft game, i thought the game was very difficult and almost gave up and never wanted to come back, But after every single boss fight i felt this rush of dopamine and it is very satisfying when you defeat a boss that you die a lot on,  When the DLC dropped i was very excited and this dlc made me more hyped about how eldenring was going to exceed more expectations.\r\n\r\nThe game will start off very difficult and it might wanna make you quit but the open world aspect makes the game a whole lot easier and make it very fun to play, i have beaten this game almost 15 times on console and i still cannot get a break from wanting to play it, This game absolutely Deserved game Of The Year"}

Some of the vehicle gameplay feels better than BF6, the bigger maps feel better than the BF6 maps. Some of them were beautiful. This game had to happen for them to learn the lesson. But not all of it was terrible like people say. going from BF1 and BFV to this, was jarring, and I expected more from the developers. Hopefully, they can make this right in the coming years with BF6.\n\nIf you want to play 2042 now, go for it, there is a lot of content to unlock and if you cant play BF6 for whatever reason this will entertain you for a bit."}

The open world is massive and bristling with life in a way that makes respect for nature hard to avoid. And there's always something fun waiting around the corner: a new area to explore, an alien boss that kicks your ass\r\n\r\nThe fighting is real severe at the beginning, but when you figure it out, everything is very satisfying. Every victory feels liike it was earned through sweat and blood, which can be rewarding in its own way. The bosses are memorable, the atmosphere is amazing and it is nice to realize that a game doesn't punish you just for asking questions\r\n\r\nBut it's definitely not for everyone. If you don't appreciate ultra hard games the way some people don't mind cutting off their noses to spite their faces (I have fun with these folks) then Elden Ring is a hard sell. However, if you're a challenging open-world gamer who digs the world or likes a good line of dialogue just as much as I do, this has got to be one of your most enjoyable experiences"}

There has been a map bloat in recent times as well... (And its not like Valve themselves makes ANY of this cosmetic and map content)\n\nThough not many current TF2 players know this, but there used to be a \"quick play\" system to easily find and play matches, with preference options and even an option to include community servers. It was all removed in favour of \"Casual\", where matches can start with 3-6 players on each team (instead of the nearly full 12v12 lobbies), or you could join a match that has already ended, or have no option to avoid a steam roll (You used to be able to change teams and also call a vote to scramble teams to even out the odds!), and lastly, the matches can last less than 5 minutes before sending you into another long loading screen...\n\nI would love to change my rating because this is genuinely one of the best FPS shooters out there, but I can't condone what Valve is doing, clearly knowing they can get away with as little content as possible while earning tons of money."}

It's definitely not for everyone and it has issues but no matter what it's the kind of game you just have to try out.\n\nIf you don't like daily grind, korean mmo aesthetic and p2w it might be hard for you to enjoy it but I would still keep and open mind and try it.\n\nP2w is there, no questions asked but having played a ton of p2w games it's really not that bad, if you play the game to enjoy gameplay and you like grind the p2w doesn't stop you in any way from having fun.\n\nAnd the biggest strength of lost ark is it's combat and raid design. Not really much to say here those 2 things are one of if not the best elements out of any game I ever played and carry the whole experience (for me) to the point that I will probably never really quit."}

Its developer tried to innovate with something new and the community did not respond well. Instead of allocating resources to make it a better experience, Starbreeze defunded the game and shifted its focus to a different game entirely.\n\nTo say the least, it’s a huge disappointment. Every facet of gameplay is less enjoyable and the story is non-existent compared to PAYDAY 2. The gameplay and music are not as good. There’s less guns with less customization and the whole thing really just feels like a cash grab by Starbreeze."}

It was my dream to play the game but to stay at the top i would need to at the very least play on 3 characters. Most optimal is 6. The game isn't allowing because of that for any sort of other game. No this is the MAIN game period. \n\nThe gatekeep is big, no one want to waste time for rookies making mistakes it's natural but also hard for new and returning to get back as unless they pay to be carried by buses (basically 8-9 ppl afk and paid the 1 person geared very well to do raid for you) they aren't going to complete the raids. Which is stupid because while they have the content done they have no experience in it which will cause further trouble down the road.\n\nGame is on downright spiral since the time i quit and i was the most serious about it. To this day i hope they will change it so if i want i can play with just 1 character not 3-6. \n\nThe game have insane potential and i hope it's not going to get destroyed on the west by it's success in the Korea as it keeps being ranked 3-6 each month of all games. If game changes with characters ill gladly come back and not only me."}

From emerging through a tunnel and seeing the sacred Erdtree in perfect view, to killing a boss after an unholy amount of attempts, to finding the most niche easter egg, Elden Ring can easily have you busy for THOUSANDS of hours.\r\n\r\nThis is a game I recommend playing at your own pace, in your own style, because the first playthrough will be your most memorable by a landslide.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I know the whole point of this vague, open world game is to allow you to have your own adventure, but I think a quest log of some sort wouldn't hurt just to provide a bit of organization and prevent players from skipping out on content.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a very memorable gaming experience that I could see a wide variety of gamers enjoying whether they be more casual or hardcore."}

Superb graphics and game play. No one appears to talk in game, which is disappointing. I believe there is a Discord server for it, but I haven't tried it or care to. The AI however really needs to be softened up. They are relentless. Every one of their shots are a kill or direct hit.  Infantry have too much firepower when it comes to taking out tanks. They actually do more damage then facing an enemy tank. If you happen to be on foot and confront an infantry soldier and are fortunate to kill it, a handful of AI soldiers appear out of nowhere (even behind you) and take you out. It's too bad, because it is a very fun game. With all of its shortcomings, it is still one of my favorite games and I play it all the time."}

Some of the new faces actually look WORSE than the original game, CJ's girlfriends in particular have some of the worst re-skins I've ever seen. Combat-wise, I can't count how many times I was shooting directly at a target that the game didn't register, especially with SMGs, which made me die and need to restart missions an insane amount of times through no fault of my own. I think San Andreas was iconic enough to get a remake instead of a remaster, so the jankiness of this game was a real bummer."}

This version is the easiest way to play it on modern hardware without spending hours modding it, but it’s definitely not perfect.\n\nThe Good: The controls are much better—they finally added a \"weapon wheel\" and modernized the aiming so it feels more like GTA V. The lighting at sunset looks genuinely great, and having GPS on the mini-map is a lifesaver.\n\nThe Bad: Some of the character models still look a bit \"off\" (almost like clay figures), and they took out some of the iconic fog that made the map feel bigger. There are still occasional bugs, though most of the game-breaking ones from launch are gone.\n\nVerdict: Buy it on sale. It’s still CJ, it’s still Grove Street, and the radio stations still slap. Just don't expect a full remake."}

You have to do raids on repeat an endless number of times before you can even get into the next raid.\nAlso, SOOOOO many fights at higher-end have \"if one person makes a mistake, the group all dies\" mechanics, which makes people just hate each other. I found myself refusing to group with people I didn't know/wasn't certain knew what was what. And I'm the kind of person that enjoys helping lowbies in other games, etc."}

And I can sympathize, asking $20 per game for titles that are 20 years old now, you'd expect some more polish and fixes in most areas. However, this is still an older title that brings it up to compatibility for newer machines which I can appreciate. If I'm playing, I'm not really looking for out of place objects or paying attention to random texture glitches. For my playthrough (I'm at 88% completion on San Andreas), I didn't see or run into anything game breaking. In fact I would say it was a far more enjoyable experience than playing the original. I'm sure if you go out of your way to find them, you will indeed find flaws in the remake but personally that's not why I bought the games.\n\nIf you're just looking to play the original trilogy without having to deal with compatibility issues and having a more modern control feel, I can recommend this. If you're looking to play the original trilogy where everything is fixed and flawless, I would not bother."}

Bugs, glitches, and performance issues haven’t been fully eliminated, and some updates still break things instead of improving stability. There are also quality-of-life problems that the community has already solved through mods.\r\n\r\nThis is where the biggest issue comes in: mods. Fan-favorite mods and collections—especially large ones like the Welcome to Night City Nexus/Vortex collection—greatly improve visuals, immersion, UI, and gameplay. Many of these mods fix or enhance things the base game still struggles with. CD Projekt Red should seriously consider officially integrating or supporting popular community mods, or at least providing better tools so updates don’t constantly break them.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 has amazing potential and has come a long way, but it’s still not “finished.” More polish, long-term fixes, and better mod support would go a long way toward making this the definitive version of the game it was meant to be."}

When Lost Ark came out it was all I played, the initial story and grind was fun and I was always looking forward to the next big Raid Boss to come out but then the classic MMO feeling of the game being more of a chore simulator kicked in. After leaving for a few months and coming back I noticed how impossibly far behind I was despite having a capped Item Level before my hiatus. Now the only real time I play is if I get the desire to pub stop in PvP and item score there doesn't mater. I understand why the game has done so well at launch and also understand the decline in player base."}

Zeus early game should be a hugely annoying with wrath. Some heros should be OP if played well. but its up to the player to know how to counter the play or strat. When Dota2 first came out heros were played as is for several years till player could have their say.. on what they thought was OP and not. then nerfing began.

Driving through Los Santos, exploring the desert, or hitting up Las Venturas feels like you’re in a whole different world. There’s just so much freedom while doing missions, messing around, or just cruising with the king of cars SULTANNN <3\n Replayability? Endless.

I LOVED the second one. I would play it with friends, with randoms online and by myself. I liked going loud but I really liked going stealth. I had so much fun. The fleshing out of stealth in PD:3 is a welcome upgrade but that being said I think something is missing from the game. Alot of time has passed between the two games yet in PD3 the replayability doesn't feel here right now. It feels like its missing polish. That being said if on special I'd definitley pick this up. especially if you can convince 1-3 friends to come with you. Fantastic group experience."}

Night City feels alive in a way few open worlds do, packed with atmosphere, unforgettable characters, and stories that actually make you stop and think. The freedom in how you build and play V, combined with impactful choices and emotionally heavy side quests, makes every playthrough feel personal. With its stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack, and the massive improvements over time, Cyberpunk 2077 has grown into a deeply immersive experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Easily one of the most memorable games I’ve ever played."}

The game is not difficult just fucking annoying, boss fights don't frustrate me but the platforming does. If any other open world game was so repititive with it's dungeons it will be massacred but FS gets a pass somehow. And the fact that you need to read each and every item description and decode whatever the fuck the NPC's are on about makes no sense, I shouldn't be needing to check a lore video to understand the game universe and quests, atleast the basics of it. Difficulty is mostly artificial with delayed attacks and spam attacks and just overlevelling a bit makes the game much easier so the only usp of souls-like being the combat and boss encounters goes down the drain."}

Jetpack is unusable, you can't fly cars anymore, weapons lose sound randomly, some cars look like glass (Its so much better to just turn down the settings). Textures don't match at all (some are GTA V grade and some are GTA 3 grade), its so much worse both in graphics and in gameplay. GIVE US AN OPTION TO BUY THE ORIGINAL."}

Yes when I was a kid.. I fell in love with San Andreas. I loved spending hours trying to find cheats and what not for the game. Talking with friends about it.. now to have the Definitive edition as an adult with adult money and time... I'm still in love with Los Santos. Even more so now that I have spent the last 10 years playing GTAV. Coming back to the roots of LS, seeing all the connections made, obvious improvements, hearing voice actors Rockstar has used in other titles from recent years in GTASA has been a smack of nostolgia. Of course there's the buggy gameplay in some points. but what do we really expect? I purchased on sale, and honestly.. just from only playing 13 hours at the point of review and only roughly 19% completed in ONLY GTASA.. yeah it's worth full price. Especially because you get GTA 3 and GTA Vice City in the bundle. If you're a hardcore GTA fanboy, must buy. Go relive your early days of picking up hookers and droppin bangers."}

Ran perfectly for me, never ran into any bugs or crashes although I would definitely recommend a controller for the flying missions, plane controls are HORRIFIC on Mouse and Keyboard. But other than that a great trip down memory lane.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely important to remember this is a remaster NOT a remake, don't expect breath taking upgrades in gameplay or graphics, just the game you remember and love in higher frames and definition.\r\n\r\nAh S***, here we go again."}

Exploring the Lands Between is constantly exciting, especially when you stumble into a hidden dungeon or a major boss fight that feels truly epic, but in the first 40-80 hours.\r\nThat said, the open world can feel oddly empty at times: long rides through beautiful scenery with little happening, and many caves/catacombs start to feel repetitive with reused enemies and layouts. Quests are also so cryptic that it’s easy to miss content without using guides. Even with these flaws, it’s still one of the most memorable action RPGs out there."}

It tells a rich story and has some of the best systems in game (what other game tracks how much you eat because your level of fat determines how likely someone would date you?). I feel that this was better than GTA 4, personally. It has a lot of the tropes from other GTA games and if you don't like violence, this isn't for you. If you like other GTA/Saints Row type of games, you will probably love this game."}

All 3 of the definitive edition games are broken just like the rest of rockstar PC ported games. More bugs on here than the the original releases using a compatibility mod. I've had numerous hud bugs, map loading glitches (my pc is brand new and fairly top of the line). Also checkpoint bugs when leaving the game after failing a mission. Overall, it looks better but performs worse than the older games."}

The game will never die and thats verryyy coooooooooooooooooooool :3 luv the game"}
