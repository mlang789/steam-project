Not very balanced champions, slow and with an unintuitive shop drags this game down below other MOBAs in my eyes.

I highly suggest playing community servers as they have more freedom and diversity than casual servers and are usually better than casual servers. I hope anyone who likes first person shooters tries this game because its a lot of fun when you understand how the classes work and how they function. The only problems I have with this game is barely any new updates and some very minor bugs but besides that this game is a beautiful classic and I think everyone should try it at least once."}

Dates and engagements with friends and spouses. Tons of interactivity seems missing. GTA4 really sold this years ago.\r\nThe characters and story are what sell here.

Everything about it, story wise, narrative wise, and your options go above and beyond. The combat sandbox is actually great with the endless possibilities of what you can do, what insane builds you can run and playstyle you prefer. I would give this game a solid 9.5/10. The braindance sections are extremely annoying but that was my only gripe with the gameplay."}

I started a whole new game out of pure embarrassment.

I was beating dragons, giants, monsters… yet still losing every single fight with gravity.\n\n10/10 game. Painful, disrespectful, magical. Would absolutely get clapped again."}

Can't speak about all the issues when it was released but current state of the game is great. \r\n\r\nStory is quite cool. Side missions and gigs are fun to do.

I have a high end PC, or 2 actually and its the same problem the 1% lows and the game can go from 390fps to 60-80 and get stuck there.. I've tried every fix there is.. Formating pc, all tweaks diffrent windows models diffrent drivers.. And i just have to accept the game is trashly optimized..

The world feels alive, chooms: corpos scheming, street thugs hustling, and fixers dropping gigs like hot data shards.\r\n\r\nThe combat? Preem. Whether you’re blasting gonks, slicing with monowires, or quickhacking enemies into flatline mode, it feels slick once you’re chromed up. The story hits hard too—full of moral gray zones and moments that make you stop and think, like a real braindance.\r\n\r\nAnd the achievements? Absolute nice to grind (expect for some endings ) but nevertheless nice to spend time on them—pure nova. Each one feels like scoring serious eddies, rewarding you for exploring every dark alley and wild build Night City has to offer.\r\n\r\nSure, it had some rough patches back in the day, but now it runs way smoother and feels like the game it was always meant to be. If you’re into deep stories, open-world chaos, and that high-tech low-life aesthetic, this one’s worth the jack-in.\r\n\r\nI’d totally recommend it, choom. Cyberpunk 2077 is nova-tier now—don’t sleep on it."}

The graphics are great, the story is amazing, it's very easy to mod, and the combat is fun as hell. 9.5/10 would smash Panam again."}

The reflections are so realistic that I spent two minutes admiring water puddles on Mirage before getting one-tapped by someone with 300 hours in aim maps. The smoke grenades? Now volumetric, baby. They react to bullets and grenades, which means instead of providing cover, they now beautifully showcase how terrible my spray control is.\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise, the tick rate upgrade feels good—until your 17-year-old teammate starts yelling “PEEK HIM!” while your 200ms reaction time proves you are, in fact, too old for this. CS2 runs smoother, but your rank? Still the same. Valve made sure of that for emotional continuity.\r\n\r\nThe new UI looks sleek, the gun models gleam like freshly waxed sports cars, and the matchmaking queue still perfectly matches you with teammates who bought AWP and died without using it. It’s good to know some traditions are sacred.\r\n\r\n\r\nCS:GO but in 4K and emotionally damaging in new and exciting ways."}

Before the long form review, I'll say I've played both the main game and Phantom Liberty twice, of those I played 2/3 lifepaths; however I still have yet to complete all endings, all sidequests, and the nomad lifepath. This means that there's still a lot of side content I never finished due to burnout with the game.\r\n\r\nSo the long review? Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed but good game that takes the hallmarks of games like GTA and attempts to put a coat of Cyberpunk paint on it, while this does mean the gameplay is fairly strong and CDPR's standard build/playstyle flexibility exists, gameplay can get stale fast in longer sessions; however this is generally made up for by great voice-acting, good to excellent environmental storytelling, and a semi-compelling main narrative. Overall I had fun with my time but definitely not a game that's endlessly replayable or repeatable. 8.5/10\r\n\r\n*FYI Mac users, Mac port runs great barring a few bugs here and there, if you haven't already, definitely pick this one up on sale."}

They hit hard, give you little to no breathing room, and have huge health pools. Without summons and soul grinding this game is probably the hardest Soulsborne game. But the summons trivialize everything and make many bosses  easily beatable within 5-6 tries. They failed to strike a balance. \n\nThe open world is just bad. Plain and simple. It's dead, lifeless, hollow, and every synonym of these words. It was fun to explore for the first few hours, but it gets really boring real fast. There is just so much repetitiveness (reskinned bosses, reskinned catacombs, ruins, caves, etc.) that it made me stop exploring and just rush through the game so I can move on to other games I wanted to play.\n\nThe storytelling is From's weakest area, yet they decided to create an even deeper lore, make it even more cryptic compared to the other games, and combined it with a HUGE open world so the story and lore are even harder to understand. \n\nThe level design is still good though. I'll give the game at least that. \n\nThumbs down for me."}

For all of its promises of being an RPG, you have very little meaningful choice in the story and gameplay. Quests typically have one outcome, rarely two, and the outcomes often just boil down to what kind of vendor trash weapon you get as a reward. Combat is divided into conventional gunplay, which is fine; melee combat, which is weightless and uninteresting; and quickhacks, which are useless for 50% of the game and blatantly overpowered and boring for the other 50%. \n\nThe world has nothing to do but engage in repetitive combat encounters, side quests and main story missions are all variations of combat and stealth encounters with no interesting mix-ups to the gameplay. The writing feels like the first draft of a 9th grade edgelord's fanfiction, and all of the characters so painfully dull it actually became a chore to suffer through their cutscenes. I want to shout out Keanu Reeves in particular for giving his usual bored, monotone drawl for a 100 hour game.\n\nGet it on sale."}

Free-to-play, easy to pick up but brutally hard to master, it boils down FPS fun to its purest form: tight 5v5 bomb defusal showdowns on iconic maps like Dust II and Mirage.\nEvery round hinges on teamwork, map knowledge, and precise weapon control—no flashy abilities, just raw skill. The satisfying crack of an AK-47, the heart-pounding rush of a 1v3 clutch, and the thrill of ranking up keep players hooked for hundreds of hours. Sure, occasional cheaters and a salty community pop up, but Prime matchmaking and a loyal fanbase smooth those edges out.\nFor over a decade, CS:GO has stood the test of time, cementing its status as a must-play for anyone who loves fast-paced, strategic shooters. It’s not just a game—it’s a staple of gaming culture."}

Picked up Global Offensive in 2015 - 2016 which was the first time i'd touch any CS game.

Gameplay feels familiar enough, core mechanics are unchanged (except for the trade ups ofcourse but...yikes) and overall it's just a new way to keep our beloved GO spirit alive.\n\nThat being said, after ten years they still haven't fixed the cheater problem. At all. That is one of the few nitpicks I have against this game. Other than that, sure I'd say go ahead and play it for a few hours & see if you like it. Prime status helps with getting less cheaters but to be honest, roughly 60% of the playerbase is cheating anyways which just straight up sucks.\n\nTL;DR CS:GO went super saiyan 2 but still has a cheater problem.

The new Source 2 engine brings noticeable improvements in lighting, smoke physics, and overall visuals, making the game feel more alive without losing its competitive identity.\n\nGunplay is still satisfying and skill-based, which longtime players will appreciate, while the updated maps and mechanics add just enough change to keep things interesting. The new smoke system is one of the best additions, adding more depth and strategy to every round.\n\nThat said, CS2 still has some issues to work on, such as optimization, bugs, and missing features compared to CS:GO. However, the core gameplay is strong, and with future updates, the game has a lot of potential.\n\nOverall, CS2 is a solid step forward for the franchise and a promising foundation for the future of competitive FPS games."}

Many secret areas to find and places to explore.\n\nI enjoyed a lot of the combat and the game offers you a variety of ways to dispatch your enemies from many hand to hand combat weapons, to magic or distance attacks. The game lets you get creative.\n\nA lot of people complain the game \"freezes\" or stutters.  Here is the solution: The game runs at 60fps... Ensure your monitor is set to 60Hz refresh, change all nvidia settings in your panel for performance and also cap the fps at 60. Ensure all Vsync/Gsync settings are set within nvidia and on your actual display. Works flawlessly.\n\nThe game isn't perfect but it is a great game."}

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2023 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."}

Reed (Idris Elba) steals the show with full spy-thriller energy. That DLC alone is wild.\r\n\r\nThe side quests are where this game really shines. Weird, emotional, unhinged, and memorable. Dialogue choices actually matter and let you be whoever you want to be. No two moments feel the same.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 is bold, creative, chaotic, and unforgettable. Leaving Night City after 203 hours felt like saying goodbye to something special. <3"}

(may be this is different on higher level but i guess ill never know).\r\ncant wrap my head around why >1 million ppl are playing ts right now many of whom waste thousands of hours on it\r\nthe gameplay feels so repetitive for me i think addition of a bunch of maps possibly with frequent rotation could solve that but this does not really align with competitive philosophy of the game and core audiences autistic obsession with that whole cybersport shtick"}

This isn’t just a game—it’s an experience, a sprawling RPG that perfectly balances challenge, freedom, and storytelling.\n\nFrom the hauntingly beautiful world design to the sheer depth of combat, every corner of the Lands Between feels purposeful. Exploration is endlessly rewarding, whether you’re uncovering hidden dungeons, secret NPC quests, or massive optional bosses that test your skills to the limit.\n\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, and endlessly versatile—you can experiment with builds, weapons, and magic to tackle challenges in countless ways. The lore is rich and cryptic, encouraging curiosity and rewarding those who pay attention to every detail.\n\nIn my opinion, Elden Ring sets a new standard for open-world RPGs. It’s punishing, yes, but every victory feels earned and every discovery feels magical. Few games leave such a lasting impression, and this one will stay with me for years to come.\n\nAbsolute must-play. One of the best RPGs I’ve ever experienced."}

This is one of these games we'll all look back on as a major event in the history of gaming. If you are a discerning individual of high taste, this game is preem. I cannot recommend it enough!\r\n- It's like GTA in the near alternate future.\r\n- The level of immersion pushes forward the open world RPG genre. \r\n- Action was great, many ways to get things done leaving this game have an incredible amount of content in a single release, and the work continues with the expansions, fan mods, etc.\r\n- Visuals are great, not much else to say these days for that. If on PC there's a lot of flexibility as you get up the hardware scale.\r\n- This review is after 2.3, I played the update before and thought it was great too. \r\n- The story was enjoyable but went by too quickly! Or I wish it was longer, your choice. To new players interested I'd say if you want a really good experience you could spread out finishing all of the main missions and secondary missions.\r\n- I can't emphasize how much this game just grabs hold of you. You'll be speaking in the Night City brainrot in no time. Enjoy every bit!"}

I looked at the videos of gameplay and was initially really turned off by the first person POV of the game. However, after playing for just a bit, I got pulled in by the story. Then I got pulled in by the rest of the game. Holy crap! To say this is my new favorite game would be quite an understatement and I can easily see myself sinking just as many, if not more, hours into this game as I have in Elden Ring so far. It's immersive, and I feel as though I am actually V, making these decisions in the game and surviving as I am. There are so many things that pull my attention that I sometimes feel like I suffer from some type of shiny object syndrome, but it's a good thing I think. Definitely not going to get bored any time soon! I'm only halfway through so far (I think) and still have so much left to do in this game, plus there are options for replayability with different build or paths to take. I'm going to spend a lot of time on this game."}

From the first moment I entered Night City, I felt connected to its atmosphere, characters, and story. The neon lights, futuristic technology, and deep choices make the game feel alive and unforgettable.\n\nWhat makes Cyberpunk 2077 even more special is how it brings my friends and me together. My friends Cr0w, Smokey, and Tokyo all loved the game as much as I did. We spent hours talking about the storyline, our different choices, and our favorite characters. Each of us experienced the game in a unique way, yet we all shared the same excitement and passion for Night City.\n\nThe game also taught me how powerful storytelling in video games can be. Every mission feels meaningful, and the choices you make shape who you become in the game. Playing Cyberpunk 2077 with my friends made the experience even better, turning it into something we all remember and enjoy together.\n\nIn the end, Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t just a game I love—it’s a world I shared with my friends, and that’s what makes it truly special."}

Vast choices of weapons, armour and play styles. The magic was so beautiful and also had many different schools of magic. Lovable characters, I ended up getting quite attached to a lot of them, and they had good stories and quests. My only critique and thing I disliked in the game, was trying to find the cursid wise beasts, the spirit turtles, they proved very difficult to find. Overall I had a lot of fun with the game, it was worth my time and effort. I highly reccomend."}

This truly speaks to how captivating and engaging the experience is.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 stands out as one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. The detailed world-building in Night City is unparalleled, with intricate narratives and complex characters that kept me hooked from start to finish. The freedom to explore and customize your experience is truly remarkable, and the modding community has only expanded the game’s potential, making it even more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Cyberpunk 2077 apart is its blend of deep storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and a dynamic, living world. It’s a game that rewards exploration and creativity, and it’s easy to see why it’s become one of my all-time favorites.\r\n\r\nIn short, if you haven’t yet ventured into Night City, I highly recommend it. It’s a game that truly deserves a spot in any gamer’s top 10 list."}

The open world feels huge, alive, and full of mysteries. Every location is unique, beautifully designed, and invites you to explore. The atmosphere ranges from mystical and calm to dark and overwhelming and that’s exactly what makes the game so captivating.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is absolutely masterful. The music fits perfectly in every situation, whether during exploration, intense boss fights, or quiet moments. It enhances the mood, builds tension, and often creates pure goosebumps.\r\n\r\nThe bosses are another major highlight. They are creatively designed, challenging, and incredibly epic in their presentation. Every fight feels like a special event. The lore and story, which gradually unfold, add a lot of depth and make the world even more fascinating.\r\n\r\nFor me, Elden Ring comes incredibly close to being a perfect game. It’s very near to what I would call a truly flawless and outstanding experience.\r\n\r\nElden Ring is an absolute masterpiece full of atmosphere, excitement, and unforgettable moments. A clear recommendation."}

Quitting the game for the final time for the same reason as the first couple times. The unskippable, monotonous, boring cutscenes and gameplay. I had about 20 minutes to play right now, loaded save game. Braindance. Oh, right. That's why I stopped playing before, because I didn't have time to waste. Alas here I am writing this review instead of playing. \r\n\r\nTLDR. It's okay. Melee is fun. Guns are unique and boring the same. Feel pretty good to shoot, especially as you level up and fine tune. But you'll quickly discover each playthrough/character is very specific. You use SMG on this guy. You use swords on this guy. You hack with this girl. Top all that off with the fact you can only respec your character once. Why? So I'm forced to play the awful story missions, again? \r\n\r\nThe bugs are out of control. The crime system is still incredibly lame. Driving vehicles is, again, okay. This isn't an RPG. You can't do anything and be anyone. You are V, the person who will run the same boring mission and die the same way. Again. And again. \r\n\r\nPS: The Witcher 3 wasn't that great either. My how CDPR has changed."}

The challenge could be fun at times but didnt feel very rewarding\r\n\r\nSome things I didn't like:\r\n-Fighting through the world didnt feel challenging enough\r\n-Aside from treasure, most open world loot didn't have much use\r\n-Not enough human-like enemies. It feels boring to fight just a bunch of oversized masses that flop themselves at you\r\n-Even the final boss wasn't gratifying at all in stage 2. It is just another blob that then uses mobility, distance and burst spells to cheese you\r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n-Fights with bosses like Malenia, Crucible knights, Malekith were all enjoyable and the game needs more enemies and bosses of that style\r\n-You might lose a lot of runes in Haligree if you are trying to loot everything like me\r\n-If you are struggling, it is probably 1 of 2 things... 1) you are in an area that your levels simply arent ready for yet or 2) you haven't yet figured out how to min-max your DPS with weapons/abilities/spells yet\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I have played about 20% of the DLC and just don't feel compelled to continue. Due to the reasons above\r\n\r\nGLHF"}

Years. Through patches, updates, metas, and whatever phase the devs are currently experimenting with. Loyalty has never been the issue.\n\nThe cheating system, however, very much has.\n\nIt would be fantastic — truly revolutionary — if at some point during this long, shared history, the developers decided to fix it. Not reinvent it. Not “improve detection over time.” Just… fix it. Cheaters remain a regular feature, and reporting often feels more ceremonial than effective.\n\nThe game itself is still fun, otherwise we wouldn’t still be here. But nothing kills enthusiasm faster than realizing skill, time, and effort are optional when someone else is running third-party software with zero consequences.\n\nWe’ll probably keep playing. We always do.\n\nIt would just be nice if fair play eventually joined us.\n-SR"}

Good combat as well especially the gunplay and quickhack (stealth) aspects of it. Game's a little glitchy and buggy though.

The first playthrough should be blind or partially blind in case you get lost, other than that I recommend that you go for one type of build instead of spreading your stats across the board (Health > Stamina > Str/Dex/fai/Int). For the best experience (after your first run) imo is to run a basic straightsword or greatsword with nice shield and then try and learn all the bosses. It is extremely hard ofc but its honestly my favorite way to play since winning feels better than any other achievement in life. Just you, your sword, and your shield against this unfair world of monsters. Remember this if you feel like the worst player to touch a game... no human is able to beat these monsters in real life, that is the point, you are not human for you are the tarnished, chosen to defy death and come back to life and retry the bosses all over again, don't get greedy as the bosses never become slower, they never change their movesets or counters. Die.Learn.Destroy."}

The threat of bots is always alive as long as Valve continues to funnel the majority of tf2's playerbase into their own servers, where they do little to no moderation.\r\n\r\nValve should bring back the ability to select teams, in order to keep games balanced. Valve should also bring back the quickplay system. It kept both Valve servers and dedicated community servers populated. And matches within community servers are allowed to go on for hours, meaning you can play on the same map/gamemode to your heart's content.\r\n\r\nTf2, as a software, was developed by Valve, yes. But its very experience was developed by the community FOR the community. Don't let anyone tell you Valve can replicate it through their servers alone."}

Super fun once you get the hang of it, and I really really love delving into the lore of it all. Certainly a good start if you're looking to try a Souls game or soulslike, but don't know where to start. The open world aspect means you can leave and come back later if you feel stuck on a boss or area, so you aren't forced to fight something if you aren't having a great time. Of course, that doesn't mean it's easy; it's still a hard game, no matter where you go, but the option to go wherever you want (for the most part) makes it a fun experience. Also very fun to read messages from other people, and leave some of your own. Dog ahead :)"}

The characters are memorable, the quests are often hilarious or heartbreaking, and the main story is engaging enough to make you care about a bunch of people who are probably going to get cybered anyway.\n\nCombat is slick, hacking feels satisfying, and the driving physics are… well, let’s say fun in a destructive way. The bugs exist, sure, but sometimes they’re so ridiculous you can’t help but laugh — like when a NPC phases through a wall while screaming existentially. Classic Cyberpunk.\n\nIf you enjoy open-world RPGs, absurd cybernetic enhancements, and a city that refuses to play nice, Cyberpunk 2077 delivers a wild, unforgettable experience.\n\nHighly recommended. Upgrade everything, survive the chaos, and maybe don’t anger the mechs."}

The Phantom Liberty DLC expansion clearly shows the difference between Night City and Dogtown. Some parts of the Edgerunner movie are also recreated in the game, such as \"David's Jacket\" and \"Guts, Rebecca Shotgun.\" These are items you can obtain in the game thanks to scenes from the movie, which makes the characters even more important. Furthermore, the game's six endings offer players a multi-layered emotional experience. In short, Cyberpunk is a game worth trying and experiencing from many different perspectives."}

I'm also very impressed with the feeling of vibrant future urban space that it gives when driving or walking trough the streets. \r\nIt has a very good balance between scripted scenes and feeling of freed of where to go next. \r\n\r\nI would only mention two minor complaints:\r\n- What you say doesn't seem matter match in the way of how things develop. It might give different response, but the outcome rarely differs. However, the RPGs got so much \"spirit\" in them most of the times I do not mind it. \r\n- The netrumner build is seems way to strong. I'm mean if you didn't have cameras hacking to lunch you forward in to enemies bases it would still be to much. But again, it is mostly fun either way."}

I am completely immersed in the game. There are some good sex scenes but I wish there was more interaction with your romance partner. I do like that you can hang out and you actually interact like you are a couple but I'd like to be able to get down on the spot if I want and it be INTERACTIVE ( I hope CD Project Red sees this ). I say go all the way or not at all on that subject. Overall though I am very happy with this game and recommend it. Panam is my girl and she is Hot and fun ;). Plenty of action to be had in this game and plenty to do. So far the Phantom Liberty DLC is awesome and action packed! Have fun in Night city....."}

There is a lot of comms that are needed within the game and also a lot of cheaters cause Valve jus don't care imo. Regardless I suggest the download and put in at least 20 hours into the game to really see if you like it or not. That is all!"}

The community are mostly eastern European and everybody swears so much in the vc which is so fun but also puts tension on you since the whole team relies on everybody so you can t let them down by playing like a pussy. You can play with friends and there are a bunch of gamemodes. There are hackers tho so watch out and for that, there s the prime version for 14,00€. It s worth it, it gives you better matchmaking, better teammates, a lot less hackers and xp from playing casual. I recommend CS2 since it s so customisable and the community, the developers did a great job."}

The goal is to work with your team and win rounds. The game looks better than before, with brighter maps and cooler smoke effects.\r\n\r\nThe shooting feels realistic and takes skill. You have to aim well and control recoil to do good. This can be hard for new players, but it makes winning feel rewarding.\r\n\r\nOverall, CS2 is a good game for people who like teamwork and competition. It keeps the classic Counter-Strike style while making it look and feel better."}

Granted, most of the large issues such as crashes (Most of the time) or overall surface presentation have been resolved in due part to patches. However, I question whether or not this approach to game design is going to work out for studios when they can't even out develop a game from a decade ago or more. There are multiple arguments or conversations to be had about why the game shipped in such a state for the initial release, but it doesn't help everything has to be reworked and tacked on due to poor planning. Such additions don't feel natural personally and very awkward during a playthrough. \n\nI can at least praise the concept/art/music aspects of the game or even the general plot of the story, but interest just falls off for both areas so quickly after Act I. It would at least hold up in some regard if it played like an RPG, but a lot of times you are forced into doing whatever the scenario wants you to do. This is also strained by the fact that a lot of the time this feels like it wants to be more of a movie or some single-track amusement ride on rails than a game."}

I think it's because of the lack of ways you can interact with the world around you. But after changing my play style to be less inquisitive, I found it much easier to become immersed. Basically I don't go snooping too far down dead ends anymore and I maintain that sense of wonder, haha!\n\nIt is very good, and the gameplay is fun! My favourite part so far has been the Delamain side missions! Delamain is my favourite character, haha!"}

The world feels alive — every corner hides something worth discovering, whether it’s a new boss, a hidden dungeon, or just breathtaking scenery. The combat is punishing but fair, and every victory feels earned.\nWhat really stands out is the freedom: you’re never forced down a single path. I’ve spent hours just exploring, finding my own way, and still feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. The sense of scale and mystery keeps me hooked, and I’m loving every moment.\nIf you enjoy challenging combat, deep lore, and a world that rewards curiosity, Elden Ring is absolutely worth it."}

And I have been playing computer games for 48 years, so I know what I am talking about.  It even tops my other favorite, Baldur's Gate 3,  especially if you are into science fiction.  Excellent writing, acting, graphics, game play, story and characters. The only drawback is that it is so immersive and edgy that it can generate a realistic level of anxiety.  But if you want thrills, this is the game.  And there are an incredible variety of seamlessly working mods that enhance the game without replacing it.  Cyberpunk 2077 2025  A masterpiece for the ages."}

Horrendous port for computer experience!\n\nThe game also uses your full screen resolution and aspect ratio and introduces black bars to force an intended and completely frustrating game experience. \nThe lack of support for Ultra-Wide aspect ratios and the never fixed washed up and constantly fluctuating HDR implementation is a thing you are forced to deal with. \n\nThe requests for options by the customer to fix the issues are completely neglected by the developer!\nThis kind of experience is nowhere stated by the developer, leading to a misleading communication with the buyer."}

Still one of the best games out there... if your PC can handle it at higher settings. A lot of the game is set on the atmosphere and the world building and while the game is playable at a lower setting and just as enjoyable, the city feels very empty due to the fact that the game scales back the number of NPC on the streets. It's a minor complaint thats entirely circumstantional to my own PC build but with a 3060, 16gb of ram and a ryzen 5 I should be able to get a little bit more optimization."}

Some of the scenery\n\nCons:\n\n1. The open world feels useless and way too big.\n2. You need to grind materials/runes for everything.\n3. Bosses are spammed and copy-pasted across the world, besides they just feel unfair, delaying their attacks too much and being way too fast in their attack outcome.\n4. Bosses like Promised Consort or Malenia aren’t hard, they’re just overwhelming in their animations (I can’t see sh*t in that 2nd phase) and the sheer amount of attacks they throw at you.\n5. Torrent dies everywhere, anytime. \n6. The camera just sucks, especially in fights with big bosses.\n7. Invaders are either other casuals you beat in just a few seconds (20%) or some toxic little sh*theads, who can only win with their skilless twink gear (80%).\n\nDARK SOULS III > ELDEN RING"}

Previously, I could feel like a netrunner annihilating everything my demon could reach, but now hacking is a joke: you either don't kill anything or overclock yourself so you have 1 HP left to shoot the enemy. Overall, I'm disappointed. I'm a big fan of this theme and genre, but they've made the game worse and unplayable."}

To anyone.\n\nI love this game, I've loved this game since I started playing it, but the only real way to play it now is to join the very limited amount of community servers with specific rulesets that aren't the vanilla game or don't run the standard maps in rotation.\n\nValve has left the game in a borderline unplayable state since Meet Your Match released and have done little to nothing to fix it. Casual mode (and by extension Competitive mode) are horribly buggy messes that should have never been introduced into the game. A matchmaking system is entirely antithetical to what Team Fortress 2 is; a casual pick-up put-down first person shooter.

I wasn't an addict then.  Fasft forward to DOTA 2 release, I resisted playing.  Eventually my son asked to play a game that sounded to me like DOTA.  I been addicted ever since, and he's been playing since he was 6 years old.  The new patch I thought is a great way to freshen the game.  I hope they do radical changes like this every year to keep people into the game.   I see quite a few negative reviews.  Anyone who wants no change but is willing to play for 30 years can go back and play the WC3 with the mod, that thing is frozen in time forever.\n\nI have to admit the game is starting to wane with me too, but thats not because of the changes.  Its hard to keep up with the game trends to remain relevant in playing.  \n\nKudos to the makers of DOTA 2., keep evolving!"}

I'd say it's more of an FPS than Fallout.\r\n\r\nThis isn't like The Division or something where you can't take on high level enemies just because they are high level. Sure, you can't take on a gang of upper level enemies but one or two you'll be ok against even at lower levels.

The population that plays this game has decreased in quality dramatically since its last update (2017) likely due to covid causing a surge of new PC owners and gamers.

Players are certainly more competent or aware on average than they were a decade ago, which one may think would lead to better match quality, but they are also more exploitative of the game's poorly designed mechanics and systems, and they speedrun matches so they can get back to the loading screen ASAP. you rarely see players who actually like TF2 for what makes it special and try to achieve mastery of mechanics and instead see a flood of people basically cheesing games to get petty \"victories\" and achieve the fleeting ecstasy that only a subtard could feel upon being told that they \"won\""}

Do the gigs, side gigs and whatever else you find. Pickup loot to sell and buy condos, cyberware and cars. Take out cyberpsychos without killing them, or kill them if that's what you feel like doing.

I dreamed of playing it years ago, waited actual months to get my hands on it. First few days i couldn't do anything besides it and those few weeks were insane. I played almost daily and that's the reason i regret going to the Embers.\r\n\r\nI felt like there is still time, one more gig here, another mission there and that is still will be time to finish the game, but i rushed it — went to the Hanako and finished the main story. And after the ending, even when i'm back to the NC — it's no longer the same city. \r\n\r\nI love Night City for it's aesthetics, seeing the centre for the first time felt to like being a child, having the whole world to discover.

There’s plenty of hidden loot and clever easter eggs to discover, which makes the experience even more rewarding. Overall, this is a truly memorable game."}

I play it on a laptop not meant for gaming and so there was the added difficulty of a pretty bad pc port which has very slow input lag and control drift, in addition to stuttering and whatnot, but enemies and bosses are mostly doable as long as they are predictable. Once I got a controller, everything became much easier due to more responsive controls and whatnot, even on this potato laptop.\r\n\r\nSome critiques:\r\n1. Some of the level and arena designs are quite poor in that they present difficulties unrelated to the game mechanics but are purely technical such as giant bosses in tiny arenas which lead to cameras constantly clipping into the walls and the boss itself\r\n2. These poor design issues combine with poor controls to create situations where you are really fighting against your own PC and camera rather than the boss itself, which can be a challenge in itself but not the enjoyable point of this game.\r\n\r\nAll in all, still a very enjoyable game with an actual challenge."}

I googled my concerns, found that there were many others like me. I refunded the game, and never looked back.\r\n\r\nUntil now. Man, what a comeback. What a STORY. I played 80% of the game in vanilla 2.3, and THEN I modded it and WOW. It's like an entirely different game both times. There's a ton of depth, a ton of different ways to play. Stealth? Done. Shoot em' up? Done. Cars? Weapons? Almost unending variations, then mods will add even more if you wish. Every time I turn down an alleyway I haven't explored, I find something new to do. \r\n\r\nThe story progresses at a rate that gives you a chance to relish in a feeling or a mood, but still moves along fast enough that you can spend an hour each evening and feel like you accomplished something.\r\n\r\nJust buy it if you haven't tried it, and if you like it as much as I did, there's an expansion that added almost an entirely new main story worth of content. \r\n\r\nI am pleased with CDPR and the efforts they took to fix the game, and I am VERY excited for a sequel."}

As of writing this, I'm playing through Cyberpunk 2077 for the fifth time across Xbox and Steam. It is that good.\n\nThe gameplay and customization is great. You really can go at most scenarios however you wish, be it stealth, guns blazing, turning enemies on each other, or even charging in with a plastic meat stick. There's a solid perk system that allows you to create some interesting, highly specialized builds.\n\nThe story is well written and entertaining, even the side missions and filler tasks have their own little stories that occasionally tie into the overall plot. I have found myself actually getting lost reading logs and listening to dialogues just to see some of those webs that the writers at CDPR created.\n\nThe setting and visuals are amazing. There's a reason this game has been used as a benchmark over the last five years, but beyond that, it truly is something to see the neon filled, futuristic dystopia that is Night City."}

I love this game since you can't go in sword swinging or else your getting punished.  It teach's you real things you can apply in your real life as well.  And i think that's what made my love for this game so strong and don't want to stop playing.  It can make you want to quit when you die but you'll never truly fail unless you give up.  It's so fun exploring new areas or fighting a difficult boss even if your getting destroyed, it's still fun.  I love dying in stupid ways since it makes me laugh almost every time.  Give it a try if your wanting to get into these types of games.  Elden ring has proved it self to fun, fair, and difficult challenge and adventure.  Can't wait for the dlc and ng+."}

There are many different styles of play.

My biggest gripe is that the catacombs, mines, and some bosses tend to be either straight up copies of one another or feel repetitive.

I would rate this a VERY solid 8/10. So far I have completed one of the endngs and plan to see the rest as well as complete the DLC. \r\n\r\nThe main reason I don't give this game a 9 or 10 out of 10 is mainly because I ran across quite a few bugs (Still nothing close to how bad it was when the game first released) and I also have a few nitpicks about the story and character resolutions. (However, this may change after I see the other endings even though I think I may have gotten the best one)\r\n\r\nOverall, this game is definitely worth it and I recommend it to anyone even at full price."}

Terrible anti-cheat. Good thing that with minimal effort you can just say no to EAC, and with about the same minimal effort you can install a simple mod to do better coop than was available in the base game. Unfortunately, the fact that I refuse to deal with EAC means my review may be tainted by my respect for my computer, so bear this in mind...\r\nThe game is utterly beautiful. Nobody is shocked by this, but even on low graphics, the game looks amazing. The gameplay, too, is fun. It's tense, and it can be frustrating when you die at a bad time, but overall I quite enjoy it.\r\nI hear the story is incredible, but I was spoiled with half of it years ago and the friends I play with want to skip cutscenes (having played the game several times), so I really don't experience it too often. Though, what I do experience is interesting.\r\nThat said, the game is sometimes unstable. I wouldn't bring this up on my [i]modded experience[/i], but I've heard from almost everyone I talk to that the base game is [i]worse[/i] on this front.

There will, for better or worse, probably never be another game like it. I have never inhabited a world so deeply considered and detailed than the Lands Between, each step you take carries with it the footsteps of generations past. It's beautiful! If you care for a world with layers upon layers of history and civilization, Elden Ring is a tasty fuckin meal. Of course, as always, From's combat is top-notch. \r\nIt is not a perfect game, but it is truly, truly magical for your first playthrough. My gripes are common refrains too - too many repeated enemies and bosses, the world is a little too big for its own good. Comes together to deserve every last bit of praise it gets, though."}

Recommended if you like story‑driven RPGs and neon‑soaked chaos — especially on sale. 🎮"}

This is probably my favorite FromSoft title because of its open-world mechanic that allows players to fine-tune the difficulty of their game without having a dedicated difficulty setting. Plus, that allows for so many unique builds that makes this game so replayable. I've already finished this game 4 times over and will not be stopping any time soon."}

Sure. Did I care? No. Because the rest of the experience genuinely blew my mind so much that I belived for 95% of my playtime - I was a merc in night city. \n\nI guess one of my biggest 'fears' of this game was my belief that they would use Keanu as a 'star attraction' -  but his character and his story are written so well, that he feels like his own solid identity.\n\nAnyways - If a rich story, great open world with lots of unique missions, stupid amounts of replayability , fantastic voice acting and animations, absolutely sick and FUN to play unique builds interests you, get this game.  After the first five hours, you'll be hooked. \n\nThanks to all the dev's who worked on this - Your passion for this game showed in every single minute I lived in Night City."}

They always frustrated me because you couldn't do anything except bang your head against the same wall (boss) until you defeat it and hit the next wall, or stop playing. \n\nThis is the first souls-like I completed. The #1 thing that let me stick it out was the fact that there is always something else to do if you find a boss you can't deal with at the moment. The #2 thing that really made me fall in love was the fact you can be a true tank despite the purists poo-pooing that playstyle. \n\nThere's also nothing wrong with throwing in an mod making you very overpowered, because experiencing the sense of wonder the game provides is plenty worth it. I got my friend to play with me in the co-op mod, and even with his absolute hatred towards souls-likes he proceeded to fall in love just as I did. \n\nIt still has classic, chunky, weighty combat that takes a bit of getting used to. But once I got a hang of it, it allowed me to transition to other souls games and have a much better time understanding the language of the game (even if I haven't beaten most of them. The linear nature of the other ones still drives me nuts)."}

Story and world building are solid, characters are interesting, gameplay is well developed for all playstyles. There's an insane amount to do for completionists and most of it doesn't feel too tedious. For second playthroughs the act 1 skip makes good choices and sets you up well. Wish they had more than just one character reset but that's really negligeable. Romance options in the vanilla game are also kinda bland with Panam being the only sane choice. With mods this is one of the best powerfantasies on market. Become a cyberninja, chromejock, or netrunning god. Enjoy extra gigs and streets of chaos. Play a visually fantastic first person experience however you like. The community is great and a good portion of the collections on nexus are pretty thoroughly tested for something that's free. When it says easy install they mean it."}

Overwhelming negative reports, all the videos of the  bugs and glitches. so I never touched it, until I caved and watched Edgerunners (well over a year after the anime aired) which reignited my curiosity, and when I finally stepped into the game, I was stunned by how much it had evolved, and how much it wasn't all the negative things I thought it'd be. What once seemed like a cautionary tale of hype now felt like a living, breathing world transforming it from something I ignored into one of my most cherished gaming experiences."}

I found a pool table once that I could interact with and got super excited... only to find out the interaction was just a single time animation. \r\n\r\nUntil you get to the DLC content the side content is worse than GTA3 tbh. You just show up at locations and sneak by or kill everyone. \r\n\r\nMusic is good\r\nCombat feels good\r\n\r\nI really really really wanted to like this game. I had been hyped for it since the very first trailer years upon years ago. I only put off playing it because I wanted to make sure it was stable and all the DLC was out.

I hardly experienced any bugs during my entire playthrough and got way more immersed in the world than I expected to. It still isn't perfect and in my opinion has a few areas that could be improved (many of which they thankfully did address and improve upon significantly in the DLC) but I do think the game in it's current state is well worth the time if you're interested in it, especially if you include the DLC."}

I thoroughly enjoyed it even through the rough launch (originally bought on Xbox Series X with about 3-400 hours in December 2020 and never experienced game breaking issues). Since playing on PC, the modding scene is fantastic as well. If I had to name one negative thing, it would probably be that many minor side quests can get repetitive. Even then, for me, the level design makes it so fun to approach each mission from a different angle, and seeing the unique rewards, dialogue, and outcomes you can get for certain approaches. 11/10"}

The game doesn’t just show a futuristic city; it explores where humanity might be heading. Corporations, AI, the Blackwall, transhumanism, Soulkiller — all of it ties into unsettling questions about identity, consciousness, and what it really means to be human.\r\n\r\nThe idea of copying a mind, losing the self, or existing as something almost human creates a genuine existential tension that sticks with you long after you stop playing. Night City feels alive, oppressive, beautiful, and tragic all at once.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t just an action RPG — it’s a story about humanity facing its own reflection in technology. An unforgettable experience."}

The tutorials make the basic mechanics easy to understand.\n\nBut this game is only recommended for those with great patience, time, energy & good multitasking skills. It takes time to master.

There's a reason it's fans still root and fight for it for over a decade at this point. Even if there's quite a few more hero shooters nowadays, they can't achieve the style and communicability of TF2. And even if, other big companies won't go for it anyways, they only wanted the competitive part.\nIn other words, there probably won't be any kind of game that would somehow replace it, probably not even from indie devs. Maybe I'll be proven otherwise ten years later, but... who knows, who knows..."}

I made a checklist in my mind that i was going to play this game when it came out on sale and after waiting for some time it came out on sale for 20 euro not a lot, otherwise i would say it was worth the wait. \r\n\r\nPEAK game with a sad story and the EDGERUNNER Netflix series is as good as the game and i watched it before i played the game and i knew much more when i started playing. Like i knew the basics from the beginning. I WOULD TOTALY RECOMMEND THIS AWESOME GAME. Might just be my favorite game of all time, like the graphics, story, cyberwere and weapons and cant forget the weird driving its like driving a slime ball so wiggely and hard to drive. \r\n\r\n100% Recommend! \r\nGet it on sale, much better.

Back then, with all the bugs and awful optimization, the only thing I could really praise was the story - and even that felt hard to appreciate through all the crashes.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 is now a legit 10/10. After years of patches and polish, this is finally the game we were supposed to get. The story is still incredible - dark, heavy, with choices that actually made me sit and think. The characters feel real and stay with you long after you finish. This is \"mature\" in the best way - not just edgy violence and sex, but genuinely thoughtful storytelling about life, death, and what it means to be human.\r\n\r\nAnd Phantom Liberty? Absolute banger. Seriously one of the best expansions I've ever played.\r\n\r\nI've done 100% completion now. Not a single regret about any hour I spent in Night City. If you skipped this at launch like most people, now's your chance. CDPR really pulled off the comeback.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended."}

Decent game, nice world, but with a lot of unfulfilled potential. \r\n\r\nNow, 5 years later, and with the Phantom Liberty DLC, I thought: let's give it another go. Did not regret. I can't describe how pristine and alive this world feels. Mind you, I've never enjoyed a game more on replay than the first playthrough, but this time it's definitely more fun. It's immersive, the story is good, just doing your own thing in Night City feels good, naturally even, and there's so much to do that does not feel like a grind or repetitive at all. \r\n\r\nIt's insane to me to see how much has changed for the better. CD Projekt Red, I take my hat off. Game's a 10/10 without question now."}

Biggest reason i bought the game on release was Johnny Silverhand, even tho it had lot of problems i finished on different Gen consoles and after that i bought on steam as well, now i've been experiencing this masterpiece with mods and they fixed almost all of the bugs its working really good on Pc and consoles. This game pulls no punches.  It's one of the greatest games I've ever played."}

I've been playing Dota 1, both online and offline, and it took some time before I tried Dota 2. But when I tried Dota 2, I immediately decided to stick with the game.\n\nFor Dota 1 players, you will find transitioning from Dota 1 to Dota 2 quite easy since Dota 2 is very much like Dota 1 although significantly improved. The game is as exciting as Dota 1 since players will have to use their wits and skills to beat their opponents in battle. \n\nThis game will test not only your hand and eye coordination but also your ability to make quick decisions and good strategies. And because you will have to work with different players in your team with varying personalities, you will ultimately learn or acquire valuable traits like patience, leadership and the quality of being a teamplayer.\n\nTherefore, for me, this game deserves 5 stars!"}

While one might initially doubt it, as games of its type have been a bit oversaturated in the modern market, this game will almost always capture from its opening moments. The main standout feature is the incredible amount of character customization: Not only are there tons of fun and interesting weapons to use, the methods used to acquire them immerse you in the world and make you feel like your on your own personal epic fantasy quest. The difficulty is also pretty great: If a boss is ever too hard for you, you can just futz about for a while in the open world, come back, and blow them away with you new equipment and stats. Great story and worldbuilding, too."}

Every area has the same feeling when you enter, and nothing feels new when you find it. The lore is better than other soul games, but its told in the most lack luster way so the feeling of hearing something new just feels the same as the last knowledge you obtained. I would not recommend this game because it feels unfinished in a lot of areas and the way enemies are laid out in each section feels totally nonsensical."}

I cannot believe it has been over 5 years since release already! Anyway I cannot recommend this game enough! I think I first got it in 2022 on Xbox One and had a blast racking up over 100 hours on there before getting a new computer and preordering Ultimate Edition on here in 2023 and racking up another 400+ hours on here. \nMy only complaint about this game is that after 5 years there is still a game crashing bug in the Queen of the Highway quest."}

Too zoomed in so you can't see whats happening. \r\n2a.  Stuns and silences that last literally 6 - 8 seconds to remove all chance of counter-play.\r\n2b.  Because of this BKB is needed on 99% of all heroes, giving a few second window where you get to play.\r\n3.    Hero speed is much faster and the map is much bigger, combined with point 1 and its constant panning.\r\n4.    Jungle role is still not a thing, and the jungle is way less interesting.\r\n5.    Hero balance is non-existent. heroes hard counter each-other. Games are decided in hero select.\r\n6.    Somehow even a more toxic community.\r\n7.    Items are less diverse, and it seems the only way they can develop interesting ones is to give them all \r\n       active abilities, making the game a memory game of what item is in what hotkey slot.\r\n8.    Blink is still an expensive item you need to buy, forcing you to chose between mobility or power, making\r\n        it impossible to play a hero that needs a blink in a losing lane."}

Act 1 is great, then act 2 feels a little convoluted for a bit, but then it starts to tie together really well. It's the same with your character build: at first it all feels generic, but then it starts building in whatever direction you take it, and a lot of different styles are viable. Strongly recommend getting phantom liberty with the game as it mixes up the middle part of the game a lot and has a strong plotline. As a whole, with the DLC, this is a great game. I bought it back at launch, and it was hard to get through. Now, it flows much better. The character writing can be hit or miss, but eventually all the characters grow on you, like real people. Strong RPG, just takes some patience to feel invested. Overall recommend."}

Except an ending that doesn't leave you slightly depressed. But that's the cyberpunk genre for you. High tech, low life, and no real winners at the end of the day."}

The way that the player interacts with the main character and how V interacts with the world is metacognitive hell and I wouldn't have it any other way.

It’s an experience that sticks with you long after you turn it off. From the moment you step into the Lands Between, you realize you’re playing something truly special. The world is massive, mysterious, beautiful, and terrifying all at once — and none of it feels empty. Every corner hides a secret, every horizon pulls you in, and every enemy demands respect.\r\n\r\nThe combat is brutal but fair, and the boss fights are some of the most unforgettable encounters I’ve ever had in any game. The sense of achievement after overcoming a tough challenge is unmatched. The game never holds your hand, but it constantly rewards curiosity, patience, and skill.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, music, lore, characters… everything comes together perfectly. It’s dark, epic, emotional, and full of moments that feel legendary. I genuinely felt like I was carving my own story.\r\n\r\nElden Ring isn’t just my favorite FromSoftware game — it’s one of the greatest games ever made. If you’re hesitating, don’t. Just dive in and let the world consume you.\r\n\r\n10/10 — A modern classic."}

The story is just 'meh.' I guess it’s a matter of taste, but for me, it was a huge disappointment."}

I have played a lot of open world games and loved them especially with mods but this is just too open and aimless for a fromsoft game. Dark souls 1 is one of the best games I ever played, I also really enjoyed 2 and think it's a good game with some flaws but this, which neither 1 or 2 suffered from, is boring. Sad to say it, I want to like this game but It's just really dull.\n\n I wanted to buy DS3 but it wasnt on sale so I bought this instead since everyone rates it so highly. Honestly very very very average experience, I think if you have not played many open world games/RPGs or fromsofts previous titles you'll probably like this but just know this game is not a masterpiece and the people saying that are genuinely clueless as in they have not touched a good RPG in their life hence they see this as \"10/10.\" Dark souls 1 was a masterpiece on it's own for what it did, this is absolutely mediocre and I hate to say it since I paid 50 CAD for it and I literally don't wanna continue it. Hopefully 3 goes on sale and they stop asking retail price for a 10 year old game"}

The game stumbles a bit after, with over-tuned and overused enemies. You can clearly tell fromsoft put a lot of time and effort into the game leading up to the capital, and the rest afterwards was a bit more rushed and less methodical. \nThe late-game one-shot potential of ordinary enemies, especially ones that are reused is my main critique. For me at least, I just end up avoiding a lot of fights in the late game vs feeling a meaningful and enjoyable increase in difficulty. The late game bosses are a bit over-tuned I felt as well, with some feeling like sekiro enemies, while you are stuck with ER mechanics. \nOn another note, the game is in dire need of a quest log or something of the sort. Trying to navigate some storylines is near impossible without a guide. You should just have the ER wiki ready to go when you load up the game and accept using it. \n\nOverall, 9/10. The game is utterly beautiful and chopped full of content, but definitely has its weak points."}

The storylines are engaging, there are easter eggs in abundance, and there is plenty of content to keep you amused for a long time. \r\n\r\nI'm in two minds about the changes to the progression systems - I preferred the earlier version, and can't see why the devs nerfed the modding system for clothing and weapons, which was a bit weird, but seemed to work well.\r\n\r\nThe game did suffer a lot from early release bugs and issues but these have mostly been ironed out and new features added. This game could really do with a coop version to engage a broader player base and re-engage people like me who now need an excuse to go back to it, but it provided a lot of interesting and enjoyable game play over the years.\r\n\r\n9/10 for look, feel, humor, characterizations and a decent story to follow, and, of course, Keanu Reeves... but you do need a pretty fast system and excellent graphics card to really make the most of it - it runs like a dog on low end systems..."}

I love this game: the story, the characters, the fun, the love the devs put in all of the updates, the graphics, the music, just all of it. ALL OF IT. To me, this game is a 9.9 and truly, I hope someday a game will beat it for the top spot in my heart. It would be a perfect 10, but... it needs a better character creation without mods to make it better. Like, complete body and face sculpting to perfect your desired look.

It's still pretty good, but it has a couple of things that thoroughly annoy me to my core. First and foremost is that there is never a quiet room in this entire city! There are tv's in every single space of the entire world in this game. The sound of the same 20 ads cycling round and round has given me mild ptsd. If you loot a building for 10 minutes or more.. with a tv in it! You'll want to just leave the loot behind. The other thing is the fact that you spend the entire game hacking wall sockets to upload deamons that are just far too common and get boring after the second time you do it..... so enjoy the next 4,500 times you do it.. There is a possibility that there is a perk that makes them automatic or skip the actual hacking sequence.... not sure, but it wasn't the skill tree I built, which is making for a miserable experience after 250 hours. Completely over some of the gameplay but still trying to 100% what I can so I feel that I've accomplished something..."}

Dope story line, interactive & full of choices, and the combat is challenging but not overly frustrating if you play it right. I had the game initially through family sharing, but after finishing the main story line, I only felt it was right to purchase the game + Phantom Liberty. I've yet to check out Phantom Liberty, but if it's anything like the main game, I'm psyched to see what's next. Truly 10/10. Thank you to the devs and everyone who made this awesome game possible.

Too alive. Every pedestrian has a full backstory, a trauma, and a reason to walk directly into your car at 200 km/h.\r\n\r\nThe graphics? Insane. My GPU aged 5 years in 10 minutes. Ray tracing so realistic I could see my own bad life decisions reflected in puddles.\r\n\r\nThe story hits hard. One minute you’re saving the city, the next you’re questioning free will, capitalism, and why Keanu Reeves lives rent-free in your brain telling you to commit crimes.\r\n\r\nBugs? Sure. Sometimes NPCs T-pose to assert dominance. Cars spawn inside other cars. But honestly… that just makes it more cyberpunk.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 isn’t just a game.\r\nIt’s a beautiful, glitchy, existential crisis simulator where style matters more than morals and everyone needs therapy.\r\n\r\n9/10. Would install illegal chrome again."}

Even at 20 dollars this was too much. People say (rightly) that Ghostwire Tokyo and Starfield are half baked mediocrities, and to a certain extent they are right, but I would happily play them for hours compared to spending one more hour in this tedium simulator. The first does urban exploration better, the second at least lets me explore its bleak dead world without having to be pestered by a phone, endless cutscenes, and nonstop mostly linear dialogue as its core focus. \r\n\r\nIf 'Press E to advance conversation' was a game."}

Every round feels important, and improvement actually matters. That’s why CS2 stands above other shooters.\r\n\r\nI’m also waiting for the return of operations, which will make the game even more enjoyable with new missions and content.

My issue with the game is that it was hijaked by the LIBTARD MODERN WOKE FEMINIST MINDVIRUS, it's quite evident when you look at the roster of characters. They added a black handicapped male.

After a rocky start, the devs rallied and got it into working order. Fun, dynamic world, with a lot of interesting premises and characters, the magic system is a little weird (selecting hacks from a list), but the game is more designed around the gunplay anyway. Even the procedural quests are pretty fun to play with (for the most part). Soundtrack is awesome, and the art style is pretty perfect for the game."}

Ive suffered a critical gambling addiction and endured utter pain and suffering from watching team spirit crumble in the recent months. Playing counter strike Has caused many losses in my life including My relationship, Premier Rank and Family Trust. Now, Would i recommend this game to someone else. Yes, Yes i would.
