He discover a town full of gang war, corruption, drug dealers etc... and have to save his family from it. In a 90's ambiant with some very good soundtracks and better graphics than the release version, I highly recommend it!!! 💗💗💗"}

A mess from start to finish, and I can't even get my $130CAD back for this trash heap that was sold to me, but whatever. It serves me right for pre-ordering and It's certainly been the best lesson for me to never do so again in the future."}

There's a huge difference between a game designed to be fun, and a game designed to be engaging, and I feel like a lot of people struggle to understand that. Lost Ark's business strategy is literally create a problem to sell a solution. I'm convinced everyone who still plays it just has Stockholm syndrome, because that's what it felt like to me in hindsight. Once I finally got off for longer than a week, the only feelings I could ascribe to the whole experience was a sensation akin to finding out someone I'd been hanging out with was only around to get me to buy things for them."}

Even with good latency you still get killed when you have already reached cover. No real server browser, the matchmaking system puts you in games that are about to finish. The maps are super diverse and there are only a couple of 'fun' ones. I had the most fun in the extraction game mode, though most of the forementioned issues apply there as well of course. \n\nJust a very frustrating experience overall, glad to have completed the unlocks for BF6."}

Payday: The Heist on PS3 was an absolute banger, and Payday 2 became one of the best co-op shooters of all time. I own most of the DLC, have over 100 hours across flat screen and VR, and it’s been nothing but excellence. Then came Payday 3…\n\nTo say I’m disappointed is an understatement. Starbreeze had the chance to deliver one of the greatest sequels ever, but fell short in almost every way. Day 1 was a mess — constant issues, online only restrictions, and unstable servers. The map selection was tiny and mechanics were janky. Now in 2025, little has changed. Instead of meaningful content, we’ve seen pathetic DLCs dropping and almost no substantial updates.\n\nPayday 3 feels less like a sequel and more like a downgrade. Unless something drastic changes, I don’t see Starbreeze recovering from this monumental failure."}

DO NOT BUY THIS TRILOGY, it is a shitty mobile port that was rushed and has wayy to many issues. Furthermore this game has not received an update in years so its safe to say it is abandoned and will be left in this broken state forever.\nEdit: Even after trying this new update i still only needed 5 minutes to see that the game still is not the definitive way of playing these classics, as i said before it is a game that was meant for mobile devices and the graphics say it all, it looks even worse than the originals in my opinion and i strongly urge people to try and get their hands on the original games."}

Actually caring what happens.  Cyberpunk 2077 and the expansion (Phantom Liberty) have somehow pulled it off.  The story is masterfully written.

Currently I have 900 hours played and I am still finding things I've never seen.\nId recommend this to any gamer (and even non gamers) 100%.\nThat said the game does have some bugs and limitations,  Though nothing major that cant be addressed with mods or just ignored.\nPhoto mode is amazing, but I would like to see more freedom in it. Like a free pose mode and the ability to use it anywhere at anytime no matter the action.  \n\nFinally the modding scene is EXPANSIVE. There is an almost endless amount of customization available.  \nCDPR pulled this game from a pile of crap (at release) into an expertly cut gem. 5/5"}

Main quests being stuck and needing to load from older saves, crashes for no apparent reason, minor yet annoying bugs all over the place. \n\nIn the end it is a unique piece of art that I can’t not recommend, but this could’ve been a masterpiece and a GOAT."}

Even though its gameplay and combat is top tier, the microtransactions and P2W aspects of the game breaks it IMO. It makes it that you have to grind for a extremely long time to be able to get good gear, while you can it right away if you pay. I had good 60 hours played when it first came out without paying anything, it was fun. But then got stale real quick when you came to the grinding part. The could learn how to monetize a game without it being P2W or unfair from Digital Extremes, which makes \"Warframe\". Warframe is also free to play with fair and no P2W microtransactions. We should not accept such tasteless practices from any developer/publisher, even though koreans are infamous for their scummy business practices in gaming."}

I won't deny that Payday 3 still needs more time, but after catching it on sale... I figured I'd give it a shot, and surprisingly the year I turned my interest away from Payday as a whole ended up making this game somewhat enjoyable. Janky, but quite enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWhile I miss Simon Viklund's music, Gustavo really was allowed to cook, and man am I here for it! \r\nFor the time being, I give the game a 6/10. Some may view the game as a disappointment, but Payday 2 didn't exactly have a great track record for a long while after release, so I'm going to sit back and do what the Cook Off Soundtrack says to do: Let Them Cook."}

The guns feel punchy, the movement is smooth, and the heists look amazing. Stealth is actually enjoyable now, the AI is improving, and new content keeps coming in. When everything clicks — coordinated takedowns, tight timing, big payouts — it delivers that classic PAYDAY chaos in the best way.\n\nIt still needs more maps and polishing, but with friends it’s an absolute blast and finally feels like a proper follow-up to PAYDAY 2.\n\nSolid game now, and getting better every update."}

The core of San Andreas—its sprawling world, rich story, and addictive gameplay—remains just as engaging and nostalgic as ever. Exploring Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas with Carl “CJ” Johnson’s journey through gang wars, corruption, and personal redemption is timeless. The Definitive Edition improves on textures, lighting, and character models, aiming to deliver a fresher visual experience. However, these upgrades often fall short of expectations, with inconsistent graphics, awkward animations, and technical hiccups that occasionally disrupt immersion. Controls and user interface improvements inspired by newer Rockstar titles are welcome, making gameplay smoother than the original. While longtime fans might appreciate the nostalgia and newcomers get a chance to experience a GTA classic, the Definitive Edition struggles to fully honor the original’s legacy due to its rough execution. Still, beneath the flaws lies a sprawling and memorable adventure that remains one of the most influential open-world games ever made.\n\nRating: 7/10"}

Decided to try this game after I heard they fixed the bug issues and fell in love with it just as much as the show. Night City is alive. There is so much to see and do, so many friends and enemies to make, and so many stories to be told. The gameplay is so crisp. On my playthrough I decided to go sandy melee and despite slowing time and chopping up enemies every minute or so, I never got tired of it. Side content inn this game could be paid for its so good. Do all the quests you can. Plan to Platinum this beauty some day. See ya chooms!"}

Characters 10/10. Its good to see cyberpunk in its all prime after the disastrous launch. Really appreciate how CD Projeckt pulled off cyberpunk from the grave. \r\n\r\nAnother key factor about cyberpunk which i really liked is the game design. I've around 150+hr in cp but still cant remember the way without map, its kinda dense and complex which makes us feel like we are actually visiting the place we visited multiple times feel like a new place."}

Do I think it's as bad as people say no but it is indeed in every way worse then PD2 the only fun addition being social stealth. My personal problem is definitely the skills and weapons pistols are basically useless unless you DLC pistols the judge or one of the revolvers every other pistol is like tickling the enemies as for skills I have 3 builds a hip fire, a ads and a stealth build all stealth builds are basically the same a far cry from the amount of builds and play-styles I've had in PD2. I will continue to see how the game will develop hopefully there soon will be an actual offline or solo mode for people just looking for a fun robbery themed shooter its definitely a good option especially on sale but for people wanting a true payday experience go for 2"}

Some of the negative feedback that I saw in the reviews mentioned gatekeeping of raids and a pay-to-win (P2W) system, so let me share my perspective on them.\n\nGatekeeping of raids: If you join an active guild and put in the effort to find the right people to play with, they will raid with any class you have. If you prefer not to be friends with other gamers, you can create your own raid lobby and label it accordingly, such as 'learning party' if you are just starting out or 'hw party' if you are well-experienced. You might be surprised by how many people are waiting to join you.\n\nP2W: Frequent events, shops, and daily prizes provide a good amount for you to level up. While it might take a while, the progression is meant to be more like a 'stroll in the park.' Appreciate the quests and the storyline, farm some mokokos, and work on collecting items and enjoy the game fully.\n\nOther than some toxic players ruining the raid, I've met really good friends through this game who are miles away from me. The new update with the Breaker is coming out soon and it will have lots of modifications to players needs and I am here for it."}

It's a constant struggle for power. Everything is gatekept, and if you do not play all the time, you will fall behind. It's not something you can play casually. People constantly RMT, and the community is probably more toxic than WoW or even League of Legends. It's just not worth it.

There's a solo mode now (although it's much more demanding on your computer) and most of the heists are at least somewhat fun. Dare I say, Boys in Blue is pretty damn good. Alot of the voice acting is amazing as well, with the pager/radio response lines taking the cake as some of the funniest. Chains calling himself a werewolf gave me a good chuckle when I was playing the tutorial, and Clover calling Dallas captain america will always be funny. The game is a little lacking with free content, and there's a lot of power creep with the desert eagle effectively making most other sidearms useless, but otherwise the content and weapon drought isn't too bad, especially considering you can join other people who have the DLC heists, just like in Payday 2. I'd say it's not worth 30 bucks right now, but pick it up when it's on sale."}

But it is one of if not the worst Battlefields of them all.\nA good portion of the maps are wide open, making camping with snipers the only playstyle that is actually viable. \nThat being said, the idea of weather effects really creates some unique experiences.\nWeapons are average at best. Most of the guns you'll encounter are meta weapons since they really have a big advantage over some of the weaker guns. Take the PP as an example.\nPlay this game if you like large scale battles. But consider spending a bit more and just buy Battlefield 6 if you want a more 'classic' Battlefield experience"}

The level design is genius. You don’t just walk across a map; you scale jagged peaks, descend into rotting catacombs, and traverse floating ruins. Every time you think you’ve seen it all, you find a hidden elevator that leads to a starlit underground city or a secret path that opens up a continent-sized region you didn't know existed.\n\nBuild wise, the experimentation is pretty much endless as well. Whether you want to be a hulking knight with a slab of iron, a cosmic pew-pew sorcerer raining stars from the sky, a nimble samurai or a Bonk Boi with a massive hammer, the game has something for you.\n\nMy verdict : Masterpiece out of 10. You need to play this."}

I feel a lot of the weapons are fairly unusable until they get specific attachments which is just plain wrong to me."}

I figured I'd give it a shot, but after 10.9 hours of attempt - with two different characters - I'm throwing in the towel.\r\n\r\nWhile it appears there is a plethora of content, the various areas of the game clearly are locked behind high-level bosses who one-/two-shot players. Even within the early area of the game, there are mini-boss characters who absolutely wreck, without the player having a chance apart from staying out of their view. Going into a swampy area and heading toward a small island resulted in a massive dragon that dropped out of the sky and one-shot'd me without so much as a \"Good evening, crunchy!\"\r\n\r\nApart from the actual play, the menus are not intuitive but instead seem to be an after-thought. Figuring out how things work, where to go to set up primary- and secondary-arrows for bows required looking information up online instead of any tutorial. The learning curve is exceptionally steep while the enjoyment factor is low.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'll be asking Steam for a refund. One day of playing this was far more than enough for me."}

I would say the story can get a bit confusing at parts. I also felt underwhelmed by the main plotline. It wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. The witcher series had a much more enjoyable and interesting story line. I felt that the games atmosphere, gameplay and graphics is where it really shines. The gameplay is very in depth. You can take fighting to many different areas of expertise. You can be crafty and become a net runner, disabling attackers with net attacks. You can take the exact opposite and be more of a brawler and use melee weapons. The enemy combatants also take many different modes of attack towards you as well. So overall I would recommend the game as it shines in many areas and the part where it didn't shine in the story it made up for in it's other positives.\r\n\r\nfor short\r\nPositives\r\n+Atmosphere\r\n+Gameplay\r\n+Graphics\r\n\r\nNegatives\r\n-Underwhelming main plot"}

The gunplay is SUPER fun! Though unlocking attachments is lame ngl. I miss perk decks but overkill weapons are fun imo, especially the new Jacket sociopath bat.

The problems have just been getting worse over time as well, there's a reason the player base has dwindled so much. I want to love this game but I just can't."}

Much better after all the updates and changes made since launch. Actually a very enjoyable Battlefield game that feels like a Battlefield game but with added personality. Like or love the creative choices Dice made with 2042, they had a vision and direction for this game and it showed. Not without its flaws, a very long way from the likes of BF2 and BF4 but a decent Battlefield game nonetheless.\n\nI gave up on the game during its launch period but frankly I enjoyed playing 2042 in the lead up to the release of BF6 much more than anticipated. In fact I'd go as far to say I found this game more enjoyable and more close to a proper Battlefield game than BF6.\n\n2042 got a bad rap, it was mostly deserved, until it wasn't, because it turned out ok in the end."}

Fanging your car around in the badlands is always fun.\nI don't know how they managed to fit so much game into this game and still have every side quest and story feel unique and impactful.\nThe depth of the storytelling through characters, media, environment and just everything is unparalleled.

I currently give it a 6/10. If you reading this that means you care about PD3 like i do so grab it when on sale.\n\n\nOne more thing at least the gameplay is not a stale as these other games ......"}

While I managed to put in around 70 hours and had some fun, it was impossible to ignore how disappointing it felt. For a franchise that’s so close to my heart, it was clear that the game lacked many of the qualities that made earlier entries shine.\n\nRecently, I decided to reinstall it thanks to a discount and some unlocks for BF6. To my surprise, much has been improved, and I ended up sinking another 60 hours into it.\n\nThe game still feels a little soulless and generic at times, but there’s definitely fun to be had. One of my favorite aspects is the sense of scale that comes with 128 player Conquest. The addition of weekly missions pushes me to experiment with different weapons and tactics, which keeps things fresh. Text and voice chat have finally been added, and some genuinely great maps too. Plus, the cringey voice lines? Gone.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nLaunch: 6/10\n\nNow: 7.5/10\n\nI’m cautiously optimistic about Battlefield 6, but I can only hope EA doesn’t crush those dreams—as they’ve done before"}

I don't know why it's this hard to make a good sequel to a game I and don't know how they messed it up this bad because they were able to make a good sequel to Payday the heist. And no I am not going to talk about the lack of content in this game because their is no content in this game to begin with. Take this information as you will but you should not to buy this game if you want to play a better game get Payday 2."}

Every patch adds a new item where you will have to constantly re-roll for a best-in-slot stat. In addition, most new players are also \"gatekept\" from advancing in any of the raids due to the numerous idiotic, toxic players that look at your item level, gems, titles, etc. As if the horizontal content wasn't enough to burn you out. Get ready to continuously grind through constant RNG tables, deal with whales, deal with burn out, and have an overall miserable time with the idiotic cheat engine along with old game engine that still has de-sync issues. \n\nThe game started off great but has been plagued with the aforementioned issues."}

I liked the little cameras we can throw anywhere and being able to check them. I also liked how we can grab civilians alive and move with them for stealth. That's about where it ends. I pre-ordered the gold deluxe edition or whatever that was around $100 and I feel like I definitely got scammed. With the always online Bullcrap I wasn't even able to access the game. I should've returned the game instantly because server issues took so long to fix that I wasn't able to return the game due to Steam's return policy. Despite being Payday 3, it is missing a lot of fun features that Payday 2 had. Customization is severely lacking like with melee, masks, guns, characters, loadouts, and much more. Money feels useless and the tasks to level up is an atrocious feature. All in all, Payday 3 does not even hold a candle to Payday 2. These clowns should give up on this dead game. L game. I'd rather read a book than to play this dumpster fire of a game AND I HATE READING BOOKS!"}

A world rich with lore and incredible storytelling. This was my first Souls game, and I have already played through it three times and am starting my fourth. I also completed the DLC, which was a fantastic companion and honestly left me hoping for more.\n\nThe open world exploration is what truly hooked me. The combat is brutal, and you will die. A lot. It is frustrating at times, but when you finally overcome a difficult encounter, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.\n\nHands down one of the best games I have ever played."}

I heard so many bad reviews, and watched many youtube videos condemning this game, and I still bought it... I didn't want to be the guy who hates on a game he never played, but this is awful. All this DLC and I can't even launch the game. I hope they fix this, but even if they do, I know I won't hear about it anyway. Literally the first review I ever dropped on a game and it's such a negative one. How is this so bad I took the time out of my day to write my first ever review??? Would not recommend, froze my system on startup twice and gave me the out of memory error 4 times. I have a 4070 Ti and a 14900k... DO BETTER! \n\nI read the community board and people are posting that their servers are not able to handle the influx of people due to the sale and even more shocked that they can't even validate their game. I'm not a very technical person and could care less to know the jargon they used, however, this is what I gathered from those posts. If what I said doesn't make sense or is just wrong, who cares? Game doesn't load and has froze my system and lead to crashes multiple times. Never have I ran into this problem on any other game."}

A lot of beautiful dungeons to explore, the raids are a ton of fun and getting better gear feels really good.\n\nThat is, it would feel good if it didn't feel so shit.  The 5% chance of getting leveling a weapon up after grinding all day only to be set back and there's NOTHING you can do but wait till tomorrow to try again feels shit.  It makes the game take much longer, I get it, it pads out the content to keep players whittling away until more content comes out, but it sucks, no other way about it.  I put up with it as long as I did because the gameplay, dungeons and raids are top notch and a ton of fun.  But I can only spend 4 hours a day doing the same exact grind over and over again before I burn out. Not even gonna cover how you can just pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to just speed up the gear grind like some dogwater mobile game.\n\nOnly play this game if you want to make an mmo your after work part time job.  I want to recommend the game, and it is free so try it out maybe you'll like it but its just too much for me."}

The gameplay is objectively worse than Payday 2, the skill trees are pretty much crap compared to PD2, no unique builds, barely any variety, They are still selling DLC for this game. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of PD2. The missions feel very generic along with the dialogue sounding more stupid than its predecessor.\nIf it is any indicator as to how much better PD2 is compared to 3, look at the steam player charts, PD2 has 25k players at the time of writing this review (July 2025) PD3 has 1500 and for a good reason.\nMore people have gone back to play Payday2 after Payday 3 came out.\nThis game sucks and the developers should look back on the previous game to improve the problems wiithin PD3"}

I'd been hearing that things are way better recently, so I picked it up again. For starters, the graphics are fantastic, night city really does feel like a real city, and it's clear a lot of effort went into making it so. The combat is fun and engaging, although it does slowly become too easy even at the hardest difficulty (if you engage in all the side content). Towards the end of the game I found myself breezing through main story battles and boss encounters with ease which did make them feel slightly anti climactic. \nNow to the main highlight of the game - the story. Fantastic plot lines all round, great voice acting across the board. The game does a great job at making you feel the weight of decisions you make not only in the main story but also in the side quests which is so rare. I found myself actually deliberating before making choices and feeling hurt or at best left with a bittersweet feeling at the end of most quests.\nWould wholeheartedly recommend this game."}

I'm in love with the new details and happy the devs didn't just copy and paste the second game. Most complain for the lack of content, yes sure the game had a rough start and so did payday 2 and had many years to develop to the masterpiece it is today, this game can become the same with sufficient support from the community(sadly the community can only whine apparently), people just need to move away from expecting this game to be full fleshed to the degree that payday 2 is. Devs, I really hope you guys continue to work on this game. Keep at it. PS. I can now say the playerbase are clowns lol, go play COD"}
