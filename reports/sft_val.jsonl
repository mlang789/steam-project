Played it for the first time after Phantom Liberty came out. Added a few QoL mods and cosmetics and played the absolute hell out of it. The story is amazing, the delivery authentic, the atmosphere immersive. Incredible, realistic characters with their own personalities and goals. There's a lot of customization in the skill tree, and lots of ways to play dress-up too. Lots of cool cars and side quests. The choices are tough. Some of the choices are DAMN tough! What a brilliant game. Left me feeling lots of emotions. Strongly recommend."}

The control is. . . unpleasant and counter-intuitive.  For example, when 'locked onto an opponent' moving back is always away from the foe, even if you have run past the foe.  Like circling a drain, and that makes it difficult when dodging or riding past (mounted combat) .  You run AT the foe and then stop, within range of the counter attack and you don't leave.  I'm sure I can train to deal with it, but. . . this is not the only game I play.  Futhermore, I still haven't figured out how to fire from the 2nd arrow slot on a PC."}

If you are not a fan of toxic people and you want to play for yourself, it is recommended that mute everyone in the game. Even the only good thing about this game that takes it to a higher level is selling the boxes that you get every week. I don't understand the point of expensive skins. All in all, if you want to play the game, I highly recommend it, but be prepared for all these things, because they can easily ruin your experience in the game, and that very easily.

The world is very beautiful and terrifying at same time. Capping it to 60 is a good decision for this kind of game, dodging or parrying on higher refresh rate gives advantage to those who have high end system. Leveling the playing field is a better choice for me not just in PVP but on PVE as well."}

My journey into Souls like games started with Dark Souls 3 to impress a guy, but I forgot about him and fell in love with the Souls like series itself. From there I moved on to Nioh 2, Dark Souls 1, and eventually the golden ticket Elden Ring.\n\nWhat makes Elden Ring fun for me is the freedom in building your character. One second I'm running a pure strength build with dual colossel hammers, and the next I’m using a faith build blowing bubbles from a giant trumpet (yes, you read that right). The variety encourages experimentation and keeps the gameplay feeling fresh no matter how many hours you put in.\n\nThe characters and storyline are another standout. The world feels rich, emotionally engaging (catch me crying at war counselor Iji), and out of the six possible endings there are two that really stuck with me. \n\nOverall, Elden Ring is a game I’d easily recommend to anyone willing to dive into a challenging experience."}

Not bad.

Side quests are fully animated and voiced, even with boobies and some cush, so 18+, I guess :) Side activities are reasonably fleshed out, providing at least some call/chat logs for context. \"Living world\" is oversold tho, because approaching any activity/quest from afar you can see everybody just in place and waiting for your arrival to start the act. Could've triggered it on sight at least, but... at least they are not T-posing.\r\nBeware of your own bike being able to yeet you into stratosphere and break-dancing furniture on the streets. Hilarious as any Bethesda game. \r\n\r\nRyzen 3700 + 2060s on low medium had no hiccups, on higher settings cooling was screaming.\r\n\r\nP.S. Wouldn't mind more Judy fap material :D"}

This game grabbed ahold of me, hard. Amazing story (stories tbh, many of them), the most immersive world I've ever seen with great design on all levels, fun mechanics, soundtrack is fantastic, and just so drop dead gorgeous. I don't think I've ever cried this much to a game before, and there was plenty of goof too. Perfect? No, it's an open world game. They're never perfect. There are bugs here and there, but the mess I heard about at launch is nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt's an awful, awful city, but I could still see myself moving in to several places there. The Kabuki Roundabout and the market nearby I found especially appealing, but there's also Little China and Japantown. They just felt so alive and homely somehow. Northside, Charter Hill, and Rancho Coronado gave me bad vibes. But overall, I completely fell in love, with the places, the people, the atmosphere... and with all the anguish that entailed. It really managed to put a lot of real life things into perpective. So yeah, this gave changed me.\r\n\r\nIf you still have any doubts then I don't know what to tell you.

Cannot confirm. Elden Ring asks the question, why not open world? And I can honestly say that the open world nature of Elden Ring is it's greatest weakness. Vast expanses of landscape dotted with enemies scattered about that you can just bypass because you're on a HorseGoat. Sure...you can run into that boss far too early and really struggle and feel accomplished by beating it early, but more often than not I ran into bosses that were complete and utter pushovers. The dungeons would be the best part of this game if not for the high level of copy paste in each one. And Story? What story. Digging through obscure and obtuse item descriptions and NPCs that can be encountered in any order piece together...something? \n\nIf Elden Ring is your game, I'm happy for you, but I found it to be overhyped meh.\n\n2/10 \"Game of the Century\""}

Game stays truly interesting and extremely fun. It's frustrating and I'm saying that in a good way since it's pushing you to learn to dodge better, to manage your flasks better, to approach the boss with different strat etc. It has beautiful areas where the structures and/or the flora looks fantastic, and also PUTRID areas... where there are creepy freaky monsters waiting to ambush you and slice and dice you! It has great map as well, with lots of different areas and each one is unique in its own way!! The bosses are also amazingly designed with each one being very different from other ones. There are no two alike bosses which helps keep the game fresh and fun. The variety of weapons and armor is so much as well which really helps in above said \"different strat\" finding. Respecing your character is also easy so you can switch you playstyle almost whenever you want! All in all 10/10 game and DLC (dlc rocks as well, final boss fight is crazy good and epic!)."}
