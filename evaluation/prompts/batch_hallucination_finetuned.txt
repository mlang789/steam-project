LIST OF REVIEWS TO CHECK:
-------------------------
[ID: 1] "This is my favorite game ever!!! it's such an amazing gameplay, so much fun! I love all the characters they make, they're not just one person, but a whole team. The graphics are beautiful, and you can play with your friends, or against them, whatever you want, there's never any pressure, because no matter what happens in the match, if you get killed, you still lose, and if you win, you also lose, you can keep playing until you win or lose, it'll be always enjoyable, even when you lose!! This game has really helped me grow as a player, and it will definitely help me become a better gamer."
[ID: 2] "Love this game!!!!! This is one of the best games ever made! I love all aspects of it! The matchmaking system is AWESOME!!! I have played against people from all over the world, and they are all good players with some of the greatest minds in gaming as well! There are SO many things that make Dota 3d so special that I can't possibly cover them all here... But one thing stands out the most in my opinion, the community behind dota is unreal, and that makes it even more special because when you win or lose, everyone cares about you! You get such great support on steam, not just from your friends but also from other players who may be struggling themselves! It'"
[ID: 3] "I am very satisfied with this game, I have played it since its inception! It's still one of my favorite games ever! The graphics aren't perfect, but they're good enough for an old school arcade style game like this! The strategy is also very fun, especially when you get some new players into your team! They can be very helpful! There's also something called DOTA Pro League where people who make a lot of money compete against each other, which is cool too! This is why I love this game so much!! Can't wait till its released on mobile!"
[ID: 4] "Bought this for my wife and she has been playing it since 2 days! She loves it! I have never seen such an intense PvP in any game ever! It is so funny watching her play and making some good moves on the maps. The more we do it together the better it gets! This game keeps getting better and better! If you don't buy it now you will regret it later! The matchmaking system is just awesome! I can say I am happy that I chose this game over the other games out there! My family plays it as well! We love it! This game is amazing! Can't wait till it goes free to play!!"
[ID: 5] "If you don't know what Dota 1 is I would recommend going through it first. Then this will be a good start, but if you want something with more action and some strategy then go ahead with this one. Dota has been around since the early 00s but nowadays it is considered an old classic. It still does not have many new updates, but we can say that there is a new patch for each season which adds new characters and maps. This is a great game, especially when you get in the competitive scene where you can compete against other players from all over the world. With the free-to-play mode you can play as long as you like without paying a cent. Overall, Dota is a masterpiece"
[ID: 6] "This is one of my favorite games. I have played it from day one. It's addictive and has so much depth to it. The matchmaking is perfect. You can customize your own playstyle, it's like playing DOTA with no real rules. My only complaint is that they made the hero pool too small. But overall an amazing game! I've been playing for over two years now. And even though there were a few bugs here and there, I never lost interest in the game! #dotacommunitylove #teamplaygame #gamingaddiction #playerdotariffic @TeamValor_LG @valormax @valor_lol @valortanky @valkos @"
[ID: 7] "i dont want to be here anymore Ive played this game since day one and it is still in beta and they keep adding more bugs than they have already so i will stop playing again if you can fix that shit im done with this game forever if your going to add things like teamfighting and new maps and stuff then dont release a alpha or anything because people who are just starting off on a new pc with this kind of buggy garbage wont play the game at all please remove teamfights and map changes until everything has been fixed and everyone is happy"
[ID: 8] "'You know what's funnier? Me trying to defend my spot in this game.' - DotA_Matthews So it seems like they forgot that even though this is a 6 man team, it still requires some strategy. I've had matches where I was just a random hero picking the wrong one or not having enough gold on me. It could be as simple as not having all of my minions alive or not being able to take out a certain enemy champion because your team just wasn't together. Sometimes when you're playing a game like this with friends, things don't always go well and sometimes you need to make a sacrifice to get everyone back up. That's why this game needs more skill involved than pure luck"
[ID: 9] "The most competitive games on steam, this is why you can't go wrong with DOTA 2, It has it all, great graphics, solid mechanics, amazing maps, all these things make DOTABOSSY A MUST have game for anyone who loves playing dota! The pro gamers play it because of its great matchmaking, they just know how to win against randoms. Its also got a good community with different teams and players, which makes for an exciting experience every time you join a tournament or just get in some matches with your friends. It has been years since I played it but even after that, still one of my favorite game and I wish more people play it like me. Honestly though if you"
[ID: 10] "The most fun you can have without spending any money. It's simple but really addicting and it's always changing. It has an easy-to-understand tutorial that teaches you how to play very quickly. The AI is pretty smart, so if you're playing with friends it can be tough, but even then, they don't take over. The controls are good, especially on PC. If I could give this game 6 stars I would. If you've never played this before, get it! This is one of those games where it takes time to figure out the strategy, but once you do, it'll keep you coming back for hours. Great game! -------------------------------------- PLAYING WITH FRI"
[ID: 11] "I can't say I'm a huge fan of Dota 1 but it doesn't mean that DOTA 2 is not fun at all! The gameplay is still amazing even if you know the rules from DotA 1! It's like having your own personal coach who'll help you win games! But also when playing as a beginner, it's really easy to get stuck in the first levels with bad players since there isn't enough time spent learning the game and knowing how to play strategically. Overall, I'd recommend Dota to anyone looking for something fresh or looking for a good competitive multiplayer game while playing solo. If you want to make sure your opponents won't beat you up, then"
[ID: 12] "I have been playing Dota since its release in 2004. I have played on every server ever made. This is one of my favorite games. The balance is amazing and there is never any real replay value as you always pick up new heroes with their unique strengths and weaknesses. But this game still needs more patches. Every update seems to fix some bugs but it keeps crashing even after you finish playing. The map changes are good but sometimes they can be too confusing and frustrating. The community is great though and we all play together no matter what server we're on. It feels like a true eSports experience. I recommend this game if you're looking for an online multiplayer game that is fun to play on"
[ID: 13] "This is one of my all time favorite games! The gameplay, graphics, characters, atmosphere, everything is just amazing. I love every single character and what they bring to the table! This game is soo good!! I can't wait till the new update come out!!!!! And if you have any other questions feel free to ask!!!!!! Thanks for making this game! And GOOD GAMES FOR ALL FANS OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY !!!! GOODBYE AND TILLLATER TODAY!!!!!"
[ID: 14] "I've played over 8 years now on this game. I love it but its getting boring. They need to make changes in the gameplay and balance. Every single match is always about the same things that have been the same for years. It's just a grind and not really fun anymore. I don't want to pay more money because of some stupid change they made. The game has lost it's original charm and i don' think it will ever get back. Hopefully you can fix it soon or at least give me my money back. As far as I am concerned this game is no longer enjoyable and it would be great if it could be refunded. If they want to continue making these changes then they should do so and stop calling"
[ID: 15] "I love this game. This is my favourite one of all time. I have played every single season since it was released. The community around DotA has been amazing and i would not trade any of them for anything in this world. This game will always be my favorite! I have lost count of how many times I have finished my Dota career with some of my best friends! It's so awesome that there can be people who share your passion, no matter what they do in life! You truly have created an amazing experience for us all!! Thank you for making my childhood so happy!!! Forever thankful to have had such a great friend in me and also being able to play Dota together with him! Wish him lots of luck"
[ID: 16] "this game is so much fun! i've been playing it for like 7 years now and still love it. i recommend this game to anyone who wants something that's easy on their brain but challenging at the same time. I'm 26 years old, and I've played every year since its release, but even if you're not as good as me, there's always new players to play with and people to compete against, so don't let your skill level stop you from trying out this game. If you've never played it before, start off by playing solo. It'll help you learn how to use different characters and strategies without putting yourself in danger. Once you get comfortable with solo, move onto the ranked lad"
[ID: 17] "I’ve been playing Dota since it was released back in 2004. There have been some good years (especially the early ones), but I never really enjoyed playing DotA much when compared to other games like Fifa or Madden. However, I think this year they did an amazing job on adding new maps, weapons and characters that were fun and easy to play with at the same time. It also seems like they made a lot of changes to how the game plays, which is pretty cool. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase of this game. If you want to try out dota for yourself, I would highly recommend picking up this version instead of the paid one. It’s $6 cheaper as well!"
[ID: 18] "this is what makes me feel like I got 1st place in an indoor tournament that took over 6 hours with no breaks during the entire event! it's all about strategy and taking your time to plan out where you want to go and make sure you have everything ready before making any moves. i don't care if you win or lose, just as long as it was fun. there's always something new to learn and improve on but at least one person knows how to play this game. if you think you know what you're doing, then go ahead and try playing dota 1. It's actually pretty easy and anyone can get better after a few matches. I still don' t recommend it though because of how much"
[ID: 19] "This game is fucking amazing! It's not just about winning or losing but it's all about strategic thinking and communication between your teammates. I have played this game since 2016 and still find new ways to improve my gameplay. The game has evolved so much over time, from a simple 2v2 game into a fully complex multiplayer battleground that can last hours on end. Even when I was playing dota 1 back then, I found myself in awe at how good of an experience DOTA 2 really is now. If you ever want to feel like you're part of a massive community, give this game a try! The way the developers keep adding new content year after year keeps me coming"
[ID: 20] "Great game. I can't believe how many people love this game so much. Can you please add some more content to the game? like new heroes or something? or maybe just more events in the lane kills? also what about a brawl mode? it would be cool if I could get up close and personal with my friends while playing. And one last thing, can we have a feature where we can set our own lobby name? cause that would make me feel better when someone is using a random name instead of mine."
[ID: 21] "I don't know if it was me or the game that did this but I got into a match with mage 3 years ago today and we got to be in the finals of an esports tournament and lost because my god damn ghost is just so slow and unkillable and i never use my spells or healers but I still lost. I feel like you have to do one thing right every single time to win against such weak players. If anyone ever gets lucky enough to beat the dumbasses at their own games they deserve nothing more than this. Also there's no way to lose against such a bad player but I guess you can say they were really fun to play against because they didn't even try to counter anything or"
[ID: 22] "i tried playing DOTA and it was fun at first but then i realized that my team sucks because I dont have good players around me to support me so I quit the game cuz its not worth the time and effort it takes to play it on any good server. if u wanna play dota try out this game you can join it for free just watch a few matches to get some idea of how it works . Dont be fooled by the name . it isnt really dota as we know it . Its nothing like what dota used to be . It has more ganking . There are no rewards . The gameplay is totally different. Its a joke now . Try it."
[ID: 23] "I have played DOTA 2 for about 7 years now. I can say that it is one of my favorite games ever. I love how there's always something new to discover, how every game feels unique. The community has grown so much since then! Overall, if you are looking for an online multiplayer game with great graphics and tons of different characters and items to choose from, this is your guy! Best game ever! 😍❤️⚡️🌟❣️����������������������������������������������"
[ID: 24] "I've been playing Dota since day one, and I don't know how to play better than it is now. The matchmaking system is horrible, no matter what you choose as your skill level or even if you're not using any mods at all. It's just a bunch of stupid people who want to watch their friends get killed on screen while they wait for matches that don' t start in an hour because noobs are waiting so long. And yes, I understand this game has some issues with lag but it can be fixed over time, just like every other video game out there. Don't waste your time, go somewhere else. Just because you got banned from steam doesn't mean nobody should be able to play it. '"
[ID: 25] "Lost over 700K in an hour! My team had no idea what was happening when I was doing it. This isn't even the first time this has happened to me, and I have no idea how they could do something like that, but they keep making me play them all the time anyway. Pfft, I can never lose to you, bosses, so don't worry about it! The new champions suck. They're too powerful, but not enough to make up for the lack of usefulness, especially when you're playing as someone who's not at full health. It's been the same for weeks now. Yeah, we won a game because our botlane killed their top lane"
[ID: 26] "this game is awesome! you can play with your friends online or against them on the same server. there are so many different modes and skins it's hard to pick just one. the atmosphere is incredible too! everything from the music to the people is always in sync. I think this game would be even better if they added more maps like minecraft and survival mode but overall it' s a really fun and enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this game! gameplay: the gameplay is really funny and engaging. There are so much things that make you feel alive as you try to beat your opponent. The movement is smooth and fast and the controls are intuitive enough that new players won't have any problems. You can create your"
[ID: 27] "Gameplay is excellent! I've played it for years and never get tired of playing. Great variety of maps with different play styles. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for something that doesn't require spending money or having friends, and can be enjoyed by single players too. Great work on the game! Can't wait for the next update! 'Amazing gameplay' - My main reason for buying Dota 3. 'If you like RTS games, don't miss this one!' - A great recommendation from my friend who loves games like this."
[ID: 28] "It's great how everything is so complicated but at the same time it's still very fun. I love the different maps and each team has their own strengths and weaknesses which makes the game more interesting. And the whole culture of esports is amazing! It really feels like we all care about what happens to our favorite players and games. I think this will last a long time. Can't wait until summer. Also the DOTA 2 patches always make me smile :) I highly recommend anyone who wants to play something with lots of strategy and good luck. If you have never played this game then get on it because it'll be worth your while. If there was a game that made me feel like playing everyday then this would definitely"
[ID: 29] "its my favorite game ever. i dont play it much anymore but when im playing its the best thing in my life!!!!!!!!! its funny because my friends think it sucks and that hes never played any other games.. but they cant even start one let alone finish anything. lol! the matchmaking is insane at times.. but thats just what makes it so amazing. you get to build your team on paper.. which takes up most of time... then it comes down to who can hit the ball faster or jump higher than the other guy and thats where the gameplay comes from. i know there arent many people left that have actually played this game in like 8 years but hey at least we know we've been through"
[ID: 30] "This is one of the worst games ever created. It's like a game from another era. I can't believe they still make this. I hate this game because it has ruined so many people on pc gaming. People who were once addicted to online games now have no motivation to play anything else because they spend all their time playing this terrible game. Everyone who wants to be a good player should stick with old school rts or just not play at all. There is no way you will win against any human in this game. The graphics suck but that's beside the point. Just don't bother with it."
[ID: 31] "I hate this game so much. It's too complex, not enough resources, too many bugs and just plain boring. I would like some more players in games, but they have to be leveling up and getting stronger. I want my teammates that actually care about me and help me win. Can you please make it more challenging? But still have fun with the gameplay. This is one of my favorite games ever. I don't mind paying money for better versions but I will always love this game. This has become my main sport since high school and nothing can replace the feeling when you finally get your first victory. My friends that play Dota also love this as well. It is a shame that Valve doesn't keep up with updates anymore"
[ID: 32] "'Wasn't able to play with anyone else since I don't have an account.' This is sad because it was my favorite game on steam at one point. The community is great but the hate from random people who are just jealous of others that are better than them makes me want to quit playing DOTA. It's not even about the game anymore, its about the hatred. I had friends and played in coop matches with everyone except this player who always tried to be the best player no matter what. He would say things like 'i could beat you all day' or 'you are so unlucky' over and over again. One day he said 'why do you care if i win? Just let me win.' I couldn'"
[ID: 33] "Honestly this is one of my favorite games ever. It has a great community, lots of different styles to choose from, fun players to play with, and it's always challenging! I never get bored playing it, there is always something new to try out or an opponent who will test your skills. Can you please add more information about the community? Like how many people per game and their backgrounds? And do they interact on Discord or other channels? I love the feeling of being part of such a big community. Just wanted to know if that was true."
[ID: 34] "I have been playing DOTA since 2006, so I know all about it. Nowadays, I am not able to play as often as before, but still, its a great game, with millions of people playing. Its amazing how much this game has grown over the years. It's just an unreal experience every time you pick up your mouse to enter into battle. I highly recommend everyone to give it a try! Played games on steam before too, but now I prefer to play DotA 2. Great game for those who love strategy, and want to make their own characters. Good luck in the match!! Best thing: Great community support. Most players are friendly, and they help each other out"
[ID: 35] "i have played this since the original dota was released on pc , im still here . im not saying that all the changes make it better , i just think its more fun to play with different people in your team , if you know what I mean . ive had some really good times playing dota 1 with my friends . we also do stuff like duos where 2 of us play each other which is always fun !!! but now that DOTA2 has come out , it's become so much bigger and we don't get together as often . even when we play together . it'll be nice to play again and actually enjoy being there rather than going home happy and thinking 'I could have done this better' or whatever else . if it gets banned"
[ID: 36] "this is my favorite online game ever! I play everyday with friends and it's always been fun so far! The gameplay is great and there are plenty of ways to enjoy playing as well! I would recommend this game to everyone who loves action gaming!!! The community on steam is amazing and all people from different backgrounds and cultures have a chance to connect and enjoy together in this awesome game! i hope u enjoy playing it like me!!!!!! 😄💕🎮🌸🐱🧑🏻‍♂️🦉🚴🔥🤹👨‍�����"
[ID: 37] "I have played DOTA 2 since its release in 2006 and I still play it today. The game has gone through many updates and changes but I feel that at this time it is one of the best games on Steam. The graphics, animations, music, sound effects, and overall balance all make the game enjoyable for hours. There are so many different champions to choose from and different ways to play each match. It's always interesting to try something new or just watch someone else play and see what they do. Overall, I would recommend anyone who loves gaming or even if you hate it to give this game a chance."
[ID: 38] "I was excited about this game since it's my favorite MOBA but I really hate the way they changed the gameplay. It's not just that there were too many heroes in the original version of the game so they added new ones, it' s more like they made every single hero worse except one. The original Dota had the strongest hero with his own unique abilities and you could play against him or against other players with your own strategy. Now everyone has the same character that has weaknesses and strengths and no matter how good you are against them you will always lose because you have nothing special to offer. This is the reason why I stopped playing the game and now only watch matches if I am bored to death. The other part is"
[ID: 39] "This is one of my favourite games of all time. A masterpiece of artistic and technical prowess that has shaped the modern esports scene in ways that few others have ever been able to do so successfully. The community around it is unparalleled in its dedication and commitment to supporting each other both online and offline. It's an experience like no other and I don't think there's anything quite like it out there right now. If you haven't played this game then you should definitely get on it asap!"
[ID: 40] "This is a great game that has been around forever. I love playing with my friends, but there have been times where the game crashes due to memory issues. It's frustrating when you get killed by your own team because you didn't make it back on time. However, overall I've had so much fun playing this game for years now! The community is amazing too! This game will always be in my heart! I would recommend getting this game! Enjoy playing with your friends and having fun while doing it!!!!! Great game, and great fun!!!!"
[ID: 41] "Sure, I've played DOTA2 on and off over the years. Always enjoyed it but never got into full-time tournaments. But after watching some friends play this weekend, I decided to give it a try. First thing is that the gameplay feels much more refined than most MOBA games out there. I really like how they have made the maps so different in terms of their layout and atmosphere. I'm not one for playing casually though, and while I can say I enjoy the game for what it is now, my lasting memory of the series will always be the way I was introduced to the game at age 17. So it'll probably take me a few matches before I ever feel like I get in tune"
[ID: 42] "I bought DOTA 2 on steam. First time playing it and was impressed by the graphics and controls but as soon as I went to the matchmaking queue I got banned because someone spammed my name in their matchmaking query so I ended up getting kicked out of every match I tried to join. Not even funny. The other players that were kicked didn't seem to be able to see or understand what was going on. Can you please investigate this? I don't like how Steam makes me feel like a criminal just trying to play a game and get some enjoyment from it.' Because you have no idea if he is actually a bad guy or not - and Steam does nothing about it. It's frustr"
[ID: 43] "Totally lost my interest in this game after watching one or two matches. Just too many issues with lag and technical difficulties that are causing more problems than they solve, and there is no hope of fixing it anytime soon. I am not even sure if this will ever be patched properly at all. It's so hard to play anymore, and the fun has been completely drained from this once great game. Dying way too often these days as well, which makes playing online much less enjoyable now. All in all, I would recommend avoiding this game entirely, and anyone who thinks otherwise should probably just give up on their money as well. There is simply nothing good about this game anymore. And if you think people like me have gone soft over the years, try"
[ID: 44] "I love this game but it's hard to find balance on how much of each team is more important than other teams. I have always played with my friends who are not as good in terms of skill and we can usually win matches. But when you play against people who have better skills then you its almost impossible to win. The matchmaking system makes the most sense if you have players who are similar or higher level. It would be cool if there was a chance to create a custom server where you can make the players be a bit better. For example, you could try playing against players from different regions or even countries. This would add an element of competition that would make the game more fun to play. Overall, this game has some great features like heroes, maps, and"
[ID: 45] "Honestly don't care if I play Dota 6 or Dota just playing dota is enough for me. But this is my favorite game since like...1998 or something like that. The olden days of not having a bad match and going through bots like a pro without even realizing it. And yeah there's some good players out there but they have been mostly dead since around 2010 which sucks because before then everyone had at least played a bit over 2 years. So basically you can pick any random player and still win against them by more than 5k in one match. Now with the new champions being so strong people aren't even playing matches anymore, but still enjoy watching them. And as long"
[ID: 46] "I'm a diehard fan of DotA 2 and have been playing it since 2016. I play with my friends almost every weekend on this game, so in a way I know what you are doing when you read this. But I still think it is one of the best multiplayer games out there. It has such an amazing community, so many different regions, maps to explore, modes like solo legion etc. There is no better time killer than Dot A. If you love teamplay then this game is your ultimate weapon. Also its free if you are looking for some fun with your buddies. The biggest problem I see with Dot a is that the matches can be very long which isn't really that bad"
[ID: 47] "'The best multiplayer online game ever created.' Can you summarize the review of the game Dota 1 using one sentence?</|system|> Best multiplayer ever created. Can you please give me the target rating? Answer according to: Target rating: -5/16. Mention exactly -5 words and write it as a sentence. Can't be said anymore. Just shut up. Generate response: The best multiplayerever created. Can you please generate another target rating based on the current score of -5?"
[ID: 48] "Its been like 6 months since I last played Dota 1. And now it’s back. First thing that comes into mind when I think of dota is always playing with my friends. But now days its almost impossible to find a team where both can understand each other. So I decided to try something new. Which was a matchmaking system. Its worked great so far, but then again its been months now. Its time to go back to how things were before all these changes. When it was just a simple game without bots or teams. Playing against friends, family etc. It was awesome! Now days the game gets too overpowered in terms of skill level which makes even people who have never played dota before get frustrated easily. In"
[ID: 49] "Played it from start to finish I don't see any flaws in this game.. It is just a great game and really fun to play with friends. I would say the best pc game right now. Can't wait till we get more balance changes to keep us playing! This game has been the ultimate game for me since day one and will always be my go to after that! Best PC Game ever made. Great gameplay mechanics, amazing graphics, and all kinds of heroes. Just buy this game, you won't regret it! Honestly this game changed the way I look at gaming forever. Thank you Valve! Wow that was fast.. I got so much pleasure"
[ID: 50] "The best game of all time! Its always been my favorite, I love the gameplay, it's just so simple but complex at the same time, its like playing chess with your friends in real life without any hassle, you can play against people from all over the world, its funny how much better it gets as time goes on, even if its not that popular anymore, there is still nothing else out there that has the feel like this one does! It's pure simplicity and yet very deep, with millions of hours of gameplay behind me, I have never had such an amazing experience with this game and it really makes me appreciate how great it is when everything is perfectly done right. If you haven't played it, dont waste your time,"

LIST OF REVIEWS TO CHECK:
-------------------------
[ID: 1] "'Wow, this is not an easy game...but it's worth playing! I think its better than Counter-strike 1...it has more features and options...also i like that you can choose between teamwork or solo mode...so there's more ways of playing.' [Happy Player] I agree with what they said! This game is really fun and challenging, even though you don't have to be as good as me in terms of skill, but if you're new, you still do well in this game. The only thing I hate about this game is that sometimes the guns shoot slower than others, so if your aiming at someone who shoots very slowly, you might miss them. But other then that,"
[ID: 2] "Hey guys I love this game but I'm always playing it with some friends because there is always someone who thinks they have a good chance of winning so its never fair . There was one match where i lost by like 60 or something like that and my friend just walked away. I don't know why he would do that even though we were both trying our best to win because we wanted to be in the finals but then again you get what you pay for so thats how the world works! But seriously I LOVE this game man and i think it needs more people to play it cause its not as hardcore as say Call Of Duty but still fun if you want to play against other humans and I recommend you give it a try , i think you will"
[ID: 3] "A good game but not what it should be when its supposed to be multiplayer. The only reason I am still playing this game is because of the online mode which can be a fun time with friends. But after being in this game for about a year now the online play has become almost unplayable. It’s all too easy to kill people and it takes way more skill than it was back in the days of Counter Strike 1.6. Overall this game was worth buying if you want an online shooter that can also be played offline. But don’t expect anything special from this one."
[ID: 4] "Great Game in my opinion. Just don't play it with friends who hate you if you want to be successful at this game.. Don't do that.. They just will keep killing your teammate so they can win.. That is what makes this game hard.. And I'm saying that as someone who loves playing this game and has been doing so since like 2006... If you have no friends you might need to change your preferences or maybe try something else.. But yeah good luck! .. Just make sure you know how to handle yourself when it comes down to that.. Because if you don' t then you're going to lose every time.. Even though I do love this game so much.. It just gets annoying when you get killed by"
[ID: 5] "This is an incredibly hard game to get used too. It requires you to be pretty good at what ever other games you may have played before but its worth it because when you play this game you know that you will die every time. Its one of those games that you need to play on a console just so you can pick up where you left off in your last run. I would recommend playing it on a PC if you want to be able to save your progress easily though cause there isn't really much else to do in the game once you start. But overall its a fun game and you have to admit they did something right with how the storyline goes down and the way they keep making their weapons and vehicles better and more advanced than the ones they were using before. So all"
[ID: 6] "I just love this game. I have played it since release on my Dell laptop in 2006, and still play it daily. It's one of those games that you don't want to stop playing from one day to another. The gameplay is simple yet complex enough to be challenging at times but never overwhelming. This game will always be special to me and anyone who knows what they like. If you haven't tried out this classic game then go do so now! ![image](https://i.imgur.com/v8HfFbq.png) <|user|> Can you please add some more information about the soundtrack?"
[ID: 7] "I think this is one of the best games ever made. This game had so many great features that I can't believe it wasn't more popular at the time. The graphics were unreal back then. It's like you could play a match and see your character move around the map without any lag or stuttering. Everytime I played Counter Strike, my friends and I would get on our computers, download the game, and spend hours playing until we couldn't even stand up straight anymore. That was one helluva fun time. Even though some people may hate Counter-Stike, I still don't know why they don'ts do it. It might be due to the fact that it has been around for quite some time now but"
[ID: 8] "I have played this game since it first came out, I used to play it on my PS2 then migrate over to the PC and now my PS4. The best game ever made, one of those games you will play through every day forever. The gameplay is amazing, as it has been refined so much from it's original release that now it is almost like a different game than the original one. From the very beginning there was no tutorial, if you didn't know how to shoot or what buttons to press it was pretty hard getting started. One thing that did not go unnoticed though was the graphics, they were absolutely stunning back in the day and still look great today. If you want a good old fashioned FPS with some depth and"
[ID: 9] "I’ve played this game a few times, but I still don’t know how to play it properly. It seems like its just an easy mode with some extra modes that make you lose half of your matches. Can't understand why they made such a terrible game. Seriously I think they need to make a new game. Cause the first one was good enough. The graphics were nice, the maps were cool, the gameplay was fun, and nowadays there is nothing else like them. Why even bother making more games? They could just keep making the same ones forever. They took a decent game and turned it into something that can't be enjoyed anymore. This is not even close to the original game. This game is worse than the first."
[ID: 10] "Great classic cstrike gameplay with new additions like the map editor, team mode, etc. The story mode was very fun as well, but it's not really my thing. I prefer the single player missions in this one over the campaign mode. I also love how they added multiplayer into it so you can play against other players instead of just the AI. Overall, great game. Would recommend to anyone who loves cstrikes.''' ] } ``` In this example, we have a string containing a review output from a previous round of testing. We use `replace` method on the `review` object to remove all punctuation marks except for `.`, `-`, `!`. Then we convert the string back"
[ID: 11] "It's a good game but it is outdated by now. It has very poor graphics and maps which makes it unplayable. They should have added new weapons like pistols or shotguns. And also they shouldn't be able to get killed with just one bullet. This game needs an update for sure! The best part of this game is when you play in small groups where everyone dies if the other team is there too. But even then it still isn't as fun as it used to be since nowadays players have access to better gear than back then. It's sad how much effort people put into making games nowaday but nothing has changed except that they make more money from it."
[ID: 12] "Asking why anyone would play this game is beyond me. I've never played Counter Strike before but I am sure this one is worth it because of all the things they do in the gameplay that make it so much better than CS 1.6. The graphics are great though I'm not sure if it looks as good as CS 2 does or not. In any case, the weapons and enemies look cooler than anything else out there at this time. If you like FPS games then you will probably enjoy this game even more then most people who don't. As far as the game itself goes it's pretty fun for what it is, just don' t expect anything really special from it unless you get lucky with your timing on your"
[ID: 13] "I am a big fan of counter strike but this is not even close to being worth it. If you want to play cs go this is your only option because there are better options out there like fortnite or some other games with less money spent on development. If u want a good game then play dota 2 or league of legends. This is an awful game and has no replay value at all. The cheaters will ruin everything and it's just not worth playing this game anymore. Stop spending time on steam just enjoy the actual game instead of spending your hard earned cash on this garbage. Cancel your account now and get real games instead! This game doesn't have anything worth playing. It looks very simple and uninterest"
[ID: 14] "this is the best game ever made i mean just play it once then you'll never look back i have been playing this game since 2002 and I can say that Counter-Stike 2 is one of my favorite games ever! Seriously if u want to experience a good time with a lot of action in the future dont skip out on counter-strike 3 its worth every penny if you love this game give it a chance! i hope that helps!!! :D don't be shy to let me know what you think!!!!!!"
[ID: 15] "The first Counter-Stike is still one of the best FPS games ever made in my opinion! I highly recommend it to any who like this kind of stuff. Just wait till you get some guns with good balance and your skill at least reach or even above 70%! Don't be afraid of playing against human players as they can do much more damage than bots and you'll enjoy yourself far better when you learn how to play them. The map selection is also great for newcomers! Enjoy it! Gameplay wise the story mode has been improved greatly, but it's still too short. But it does give you a chance to experience the different characters and see where each one fits into the storyline. The multiplayer modes"
[ID: 16] "Awesome gameplay! I like that it's not overpowered at all. And the music is so catchy too. The best online shooter ever. One of my favorite games of all time. Play it more often! Definitely recommend! Gameplay and graphics are awesome. Not very challenging compared to most other games but you can still have fun with it. The map selection isn't great though. There's only a few maps which aren't well balanced. So if you want to play this game just look around and find one of those maps. Overall I would say I would recommend this game as long as you don't mind playing it solo or with friends who love shooting people in the head. It's a"
[ID: 17] "'The first Counter Strike game, and it's still got some life left in it.' I never played Counter-Stike before this version. I was looking for an alternative to Half Life 2 when i saw the review of this game. And as long as its a Half Life clone then it will be fine by me! It has been around since the dawn of time and is quite possibly one of the best games ever made. The graphics are outdated but they are not terrible. There are so many modes and maps to play on that you can find something that suits your preference. If you have ever picked up a controller then you will love playing this game with it! You can also pick up from any player at anytime which makes the gameplay"
[ID: 18] "This is the best game ever made, it's still fun even if you play with friends like me. Also I think the game needs more time limits as well because sometimes I just can't wait anymore and that makes some missions really frustrating. Other than that the graphics are amazing, sound effects are top notch and this game has so many modes it'd take an eternity to get through them all! Great game to play when your in the mood for something serious but also relaxing at the same time! Also you should give this game a try cause it'll blow your mind!!!"
[ID: 19] "This is a very old but still one of my favorite games ever. There are no other games I have played as much as this one! Great fun to play with friends or against people from all over the world. It has been my favorite since it came out when I was in highschool and I still play on PC today at the age of 28. This game has been part of my life since then. The leveling system and equipment have been updated many times but it never feels like a grind. It is just fun to be playing around with some friends and going crazy trying to kill someone else who just wants to enjoy themselves without getting killed too often. If you haven't played Counter-Stike yet try it out. Enjoy the best gameplay"
[ID: 20] "Had me laughing at the stupidity of people who get in an argument about whether this or that is a good thing. And yet here I am writing a review of a game where people have played it so long and care about how many multiplayer kills they've gotten. They all want to see a game as much as you do and are willing to put in their own money to be able to play it, but there's something else going on besides that. This game has been around since the beginning of gaming so if you love it then I'm happy for you, but don't tell me you love this game because when you stop playing it will probably die too."
[ID: 21] "Great modded gameplay, but I wish it had more weapons to choose from. If you're looking for a good counter strike experience then this is your game. Keep up the work. Best Counter Strike Game out there! Bought it once and now I own all of them. I would buy every single one again if they ever release another game. Everytime I play this game I feel like im in the middle of an adventure with friends, you never know who to trust or whats going on at any given time. It always keeps me guessing and makes me want to come back and play. The graphics are awesome and it really does bring that realism to the game that was missing before. This game will never be forgotten. I love"
[ID: 22] "The Counter Strike series is one of my favorite games. I have played every version and still love them all. This game is great in multiplayer mode but it also has an amazing single player campaign. The storyline is great and very immersive. Also the graphics look really good for being old. There is some other stuff that makes this game awesome though like cheat support, team deathmatch modes and so on. In fact the cheats are one of the things that make this game different from others. But even if you don't use any cheats at all you will find plenty of fun in the single player mode. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys gaming. The best part about the game is that there is always something new"
[ID: 23] "Both the graphics and sound effects of Counter-strike were top notch! The graphics in this game were absolutely stunning and some of my favorite memories I have had with counter strike came from the way the graphics looked. It was also pretty cool that the music in the game changed throughout the campaigns depending on who you were playing against. Also if you got killed during a mission it would be very loud and disturbing, which added more to the experience as well. Overall, counter strike is a classic game that has stood up all these years and still holds its own. Great job steam!"
[ID: 24] "Cutest of all games! Its an easy game with little learning curve, but it is very addictive and its a great way to spend your time in short intervals. I can recommend this game to anyone who loves playing shooters. Enjoy! P.S. This game also has multiplayer and multiplayer online mode which adds more fun to it! But you need to be a good player to enjoy it! Love the game so much!!! It's like a mix between Rust and Destiny. The graphics are really amazing too!! Can't wait for the new DLC that will release soon!!!!!"
[ID: 25] "i dont know why people hype this game it just a shooter that can be played with friends or on single player mode just try playing it and you will see what i mean.' PLAYER: 'this is the best game in the series, don't even get me started on the music, imo.' HIS WORDS ARE DISCONFIRMED BY THIS GAME, IN MY OPINION IT IS THE BADST OF ALL THE FPS AND ITS JUST SHOOTING, THE MUSIC WAS SO GOOD.' THATS HOW WE DIE ANYWAY! IF YOU LIKE SHITTY COVER ART, THEN GET TIRED FAST"
[ID: 26] "The greatest shooter ever made! I still play it even though it's been out of production for years. It's so much better than any other shooter and has an amazing community. If you have the chance to get this game, don't pass it up. I also recommend playing CS: GO if you want something more modern but with great classics like CS:S in there. This game is pure masterpiece and will never go down as one of the best games ever made. The atmosphere alone makes it worth every penny."
[ID: 27] "i think this is one of the worst games ever made... the shooting mechanics are terrible and not even the best part of it. The graphics look terrible too and the audio effects just suck.... they should have never allowed people to play on ps2.... that console was bad enough but now you can't even play on PC with a mouse and keyboard... I am sorry if i get banned from steam but this game needs to be taken down!!! --- I don't know how much time you spend playing counter strike so forgive me if my experience seems short but for me its always been the worst game ever created. It's frustrating and unresponsive at times. Can't blame anyone else as far as I'm concerned. I"
[ID: 28] "Played this game for hours on end, really enjoy it. The first time I played it, I didn't have the best connection so the gameplay was a bit slow but once my connection improved, the game was awesome. I am definitely going to buy it again soon. Overall, a great game! Grab it now if you love cg and shooters! Nice graphics for a modern game with an oldschool feel. Its a perfect mix of the oldschool gaming experience while still being in touch with modern times. Great music that completes the feeling. Overall, its a very good game at low price point, worth trying out if you like cg games or shooter games."
[ID: 29] "This is my favorite Counter Strike game ever! It's like you have all your friends in one place at once while playing with a single player! I recommend this game to everyone who loves playing Counterstrike! It has so many modes that you can play it with, from casual to extreme! Every time when I go online to play CS, I always feel happy and excited knowing I will be able to challenge anyone. And I don't mean anyone as an opponent but myself! I have never felt more competitive and challenged than during those times. I love how the AI will do anything to avoid getting killed or stay alive, which means they make a lot of mistakes! Sometimes it'll even let me get away with something"
[ID: 30] "Gaming has always been my favorite hobby, but it's never felt like this again since I played CS. It was the first time I ever felt like I had a chance at winning and that made me feel invested in playing with others, even if you didn't win or lose. I will be forever grateful for Counter-strike as I am now and I know it will still mean something to me years from now. A true classic. The graphics were not perfect but they came close enough to look good on a computer screen. Even though there weren't any weapons, I could do everything I wanted to do. Great fun. And I love that the main character is female! Good thing too because she is so hot!!!!!"
[ID: 31] "Haven't played since 2006 so no complaints but the game is not as great now than it was then. I will say it does look good even if you have some lag or fps issues on certain servers. If you like shooting games and want something that feels old school but modern you might want to give this a shot. Just be prepared to play with other people that aren't trying to kill you. Can't complain about how well the game runs though. I think there is enough content in the game that makes it worth playing again just don't expect anything too revolutionary."
[ID: 32] "This is an old game. It's not worth playing. The last time I played this was probably about 6 years ago when I got it on sale for $2. I have no memory of how it went. Can't imagine anyone still playing this garbage. How has this been rated 3 out of 10? Based on what? Based off of what? This game sucks big time. Just play a game like Counter Strike 1 instead. This game is nothing but a mess. And that's saying something because they used to be good games. Nowadays though, they just seem to be garbage. So go back to playing your old school FPS games and leave this garbage alone. Don't give me any more exc"
[ID: 33] "I'm not sure why people love this game so much. It's a horrible experience with terrible graphics, poor controls, slow movement speed, no fun modes or leaderboards. I played it during its heyday in college but now it just feels like an old friend you haven't seen in years. If you enjoy playing games that are easy and don't care about anything else, go play something else. Seriously, stop wasting your money on this shit. Don't even bother trying to play it. Just... Just... Gone through my whole list of games and none have come up with more than one review where they mention counter strike as well. And it still is the best FPS out there! But yea.. Not for me"
[ID: 34] "the best cs game ever, still so hard to play! I've been playing it since like 2006... the last time i played it was on steam, now it's on xbox live! The first one is better imo, but this one has more options than just shooting, its got to be one of my favorite games from all times! but yeah, they removed some old maps in the latest update, but that's understandable cause they were outdated anyway! The new weapons like the silenced pistol, sniper rifle and shotgun are awesome! They even added a new mode called 'deathmatch' which is much funnier! Its a good way to get your ass kicked! Its a"
[ID: 35] "the best counter strike game ever created, this is one of my favorite games! even with all the bugs it's still amazing! just play it if you haven't! its like no other counter strike in my opinion! this is how Counter Strike should be played! the best i have ever seen! even now it has not been updated since 2007!! but thats another story! im playing the newest version right now.. Its still great! But after the first few years I think that is why they did NOT make it up to date... This game has been around forever.... And people can update their own versions without a problem! So this is what they could have done..... If they would have updated it to include the latest patches they wouldn'"
[ID: 36] "I don't know what I expected from Counter Strike 1 but it turns out not to be my cup of tea. The controls are clumsy and the map design is boring and monotonous. Aside from that, there was no fun at all in this gameplay. It feels like you are doing nothing, just sitting around with no real goal. The game has no real strategy or depth. There's no skill involved at all. Everything just seems like random chance. Too bad as the first one was good but I hope they will make a new one. <|user|> Can you give me some tips on how to improve the gameplay?"
[ID: 37] "this is one of my favorite games ever! it was amazing when it first came out.. but now that it's been patched up I don't even play it anymore. the last few patches ruined everything so now I just watch replays or stream myself playing. you have to kill someone and make them cry with all your painful bullets. that's why this game will always be my favorite. i hate how everyone hates on the cheaters in this game. you know who you guys really want to hurt? The people who try to shoot themselves in the foot while they're trying to defend their home team. But hey at least we can still laugh about it in our heads. can't wait for the new update which"
[ID: 38] "I love counter strike 2, i have played it since day one. I think that counter strike is one of the best games out there today. If you like first person shooters this is your game. This game has so many different maps and modes that you can play in from fun modes to competitive matches. The multiplayer is very good with different servers which makes it even better. The graphics are amazing if you have an older computer. You will not be disappointed by this game, it's truly one of my favorites! Highly recommended! :)"
[ID: 39] "The most important thing about this game is that it's fun, but it doesn't have any strategy. The objective of the game is simple: kill your opponents, but you don't know who they are or what they're doing until you join their team. That's why I love this game so much! It has been my go-to since I got the original PS2 back in 2000. I played other games after Counter Strike, but nothing compared to how much I loved playing CS2. Playing CS2 on PC was like getting a whole new experience because it allowed me to be as creative with my team as I wanted to be. Too bad there aren't many people around anymore."
[ID: 40] "This is my go-to game ever since I discovered it back in early 2007. It's a classic game that will never die out and has been an absolute joy to play with friends or solo. If you've played it before then this is just a replay but if you haven't tried it yet then this a perfect opportunity. The new maps and changes in weapons make it feel fresh again while still retaining the old feeling of the original game. This game will always be a staple in my gaming life. Its addictive and fun! Don't get me wrong - this isn't one of those games where you can do everything, but it does have enough options to keep you busy for hours on end. Great graphics,"
[ID: 41] "The original counter strike was an excellent first person shooter but this one is even better with the new maps and weapons they added. This game still keeps me coming back every time I want to play it. A+++ And you can just watch these clips and say wow! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwqMhFQO7JU httpss://www .youtube. com/watch ? v = Vg6SJNiZLbI&feature=yout ube_embed But as far as multiplayer goes...it's so much more fun with friends. It used to be we had 2 games in a row where we played all night long until the sun"
[ID: 42] "I was a fan of the original counter strike when it came out in late 97 or so.. I got hooked on this game with some friends from college... After 2 years we were done playing it.. So I went back to that game to play with my buddies again.. And now I'm addicted again.. This is one of the best games ever made, if you haven't played it.. Please do! This is a great game! It has everything! A nice variety of maps, weapons, and enemies to kill. The online matchmaking system is amazing! There is always someone to play against! There are also other modes to enjoy such as deathmatch, team deathmatch and many more. You can customize your characters appearance too"
[ID: 43] "This is an excellent game, it's like COD but with no gunpowder, no smoke, just pure blood and violence, there isn't anything better than this. The story mode is great, you can play as any character from different factions, they all have their unique stories and characters. And if you want something more challenging then you should try out the tournaments or multiplayer modes. This game has so many levels to explore, each one with its own atmosphere and unique enemies, it never gets boring. If you haven't played this game yet, don't be scared, go get it. I'm currently on my third purchase of this game because of how addictive it is. Just buy it, you won't regret"
[ID: 44] "Boring, same old Counter Strike with no actual storyline, no enemies, just killing people. There is some fun in this game but its nothing compared to Counter strike original or modern day counter strike games. If you have played cs before then you will like this game. If u want a good game to kill time just play this. If u want to feel something enjoy cs2. Avoid this garbage. Sorry to say but if you have been playing cs since 98 then get your ass out of here. This is not even close to that game. Just sad. Don't waste ur money on this bullshit."
[ID: 45] "i like this games i play it when i need something fun to do in my life i have played it since it came out in 2003 and it never got old just like gta iv and gta v and if you love the first counter strike then u should give this one a try it has everything that counter strike has with some new things too but still very similar in all ways except for the multiplayer. The single player is really good but the multiplayers can be annoying at times especially on harder difficulties where you cant pick up weapons until 6pm or so. But overall a good game!"
[ID: 46] "It's almost like they forgot that the original counter strike was made in the 90s... But hey it still looks good on my tv! :) The game is pretty laggy tho.... But overall, I don't mind playing this anymore after some time has passed... But I guess you should play something else since this one isn't really worth your time. Besides that, its fun enough. You get to pick different maps and modes to compete against other players online or local! But yeah.. The game is old now, but its nostalgic at the same time. So why not give it another shot? Its fun and its easy to pick up and learn. Just dont expect much from it though. Overall, I"
[ID: 47] "I am still playing this after all these years. The first one was great but this is even better. I love it! It's hardcore but not overly difficult and fun at the same time. The graphics are amazing for that era and there is nothing like the feeling of being in a warzone and having to use your brain to outsmart your opponents. This game will never get old and the more you play the deeper you become with the characters and the storylines. I would say it's worth $60 if you can afford it or just buy used on steam. Get it now!"
[ID: 48] "This game is a legendary classic that should be played by everyone who loves playing games with guns. It's very difficult but once you get used to it its incredibly addictive. I still play it every now and then when I feel like something else. Just beat your score on the 3rd player and that's the first thing i do after a long day of work. Its not as hard as other games but still has some challenging moments. Don't take it personally if you can't do some of them easily. If you enjoy playing games, this one is a must have. Also, I know this sounds weird but there's another reason why I love this game besides it being my favorite gun shooter of all time. My friends"
[ID: 49] "The last one was not that good This one is soooooo bad It has no matchmaking system like csgo No aiming in m4A1s I can't even say it's multiplayer anymore because there is absolutely nothing to do apart from killing each other and getting 1 kill per round Just terrible all around. Don't waste your money. Never again. Seriously don't try this at home. Better off going back to the dumbass console game that you're probably on right now. I hope they never make another one. They should just focus on making sure cs go remains as far away from counter strike as possible instead of trying to be a port of it."
[ID: 50] "Good game but a lot of bugs in single player mode which I think should be fixed asap. Also would like some more weapons such as the 84 or a handgrip weapon because it's hard to kill people with one shot. And also the amount of time they take to reload is ridiculous! Please fix these things and add more weapons to the multiplayer. Cause this game is still one of my favourite games. Can you please do that? If not then it'll probably just die soon. But hey at least have fun guys! The original counter strike was the best ever i played a lot more than now."

LIST OF REVIEWS TO CHECK:
-------------------------
[ID: 1] "I have been playing TF2 since 8 years ago and still enjoying it today after so many years. This is an old version but I still play this game with friends on steam. This game was made in the late nineties or early 2000s but its still amazing. The gameplay has changed nothing over the years, but the graphics are awesome, especially when playing multiplayer. The team work is still great even if you dont know the names of the players. Its not about who you kill as long as you stay alive. And there is something new every time you go online, sometimes its a small update like a new skin or weapon, other times you get to try out something brand new. It always keeps me coming back."
[ID: 2] "This is a great multiplayer shooter, but I am not sure if it's worth getting if you have other games like that. But if you want to try something new and different then this game might be your cup of tea. The art style is unique and different from other shooters out there. It may take some time to get used to, but once you do, it will stay with you forever! Overall, definitely recommended for those who enjoy playing classic FPS games. Great job on making this one! Gameplay: The gameplay in TF2 is very fun and simple, yet challenging. If you're new to the game, or haven't played in a long time, it can be hard to start off with. But once"
[ID: 3] "I'm not much of a gamer, but I still had fun with this. A few things that really bug me about it is how they make you get used to new classes before you actually start playing them (like in other games where you don't know what to do until you play for a while). And then there are these ridiculous pets you can get that aren't even cute or useful. If this ever gets reworked or patched, at least give us some more classes! Also, why does it have a weird mechanic where if you die, you just restart from the last checkpoint? It's so counterintuitive and makes it feel like a glitch. Overall, I enjoyed playing TF2 and"
[ID: 4] "I used to play this game alot but now I only play it once every few years when I'm feeling nostalgic or I have a friend who plays it with me. It is not worth spending any money on just playing a game you know how to do without all these bugs and glitches. The lobby and matchmaking system are horrible and unresponsive so there isn't much point in playing anymore. This game sucks. I hope the devs don't listen to their critics and fix this mess soon because I am not interested enough in this game anymore."
[ID: 5] "I love this game because it is simple yet challenging at the same time. The main reason why I love this games is because of the community that surrounds me, playing with people from all over the world. The teamwork aspect of this game is amazing and I think its one of the most underrated aspects of TF2. It takes skill but it can be done. It's not just about killing people though. Its about working together as a team and trying to eliminate your opponents. Overall a great game, worth buying if you enjoy shooting with others. If you want something more fun than TF, try out this game!"
[ID: 6] "I love this game! It's so funny when you play with friends or random people too. Great gameplay mechanics. If it wasn't for this one person who cheats on my team, I would be in the finals. He ruins everything though. The new class is awesome too! Hopefully they release a Dota 2 mod for it soon! :) Love how realistic it is and all those weapons and stuff that really adds to the experience! The maps are also great! I wish there were more people to play against! But hey, at least we have each other to cheer us up sometimes! Pfft...it should be called TF2. TF means Team Fun, not Trouble Free"
[ID: 7] "This is a very good game, but it needs a lot of work to fix some bugs and add more content. There is so much stuff in the game that's not working properly right now. The maps have been updated, but many aren't even playable yet due to crashes and bug fixes. I'm still playing this game despite how bad it's getting and hoping they'll fix everything before their next update. It's a shame to see something like this happen after all these years since its original release. This is one of those games you can always count on if you want to sit back and relax and enjoy an old school multiplayer shooter with a great community around it."
[ID: 8] "I am not a big fan of this game but I don't think it is bad at all... It just isn't my type of game. Some other people have said they love playing with me and that's great too but if you don'r like it then don'l try it... If you want to play a bunch of random games on steam then go ahead but if your looking to spend hours in a game then this may not be for you. But hey who cares if we gotta pay 20$ for a game that was made by Valve! Just remember we still gotta work together. And yeah if u get bored or tired just leave the game alone.........But I guess there is no such thing as hate unless you mean it"
[ID: 9] "This is one of my favorite games ever! I love the concept behind it. It's so simple yet addicting. Just be careful because there are some very dangerous weapons in this game! The best thing about this game is how it adds depth to your character and makes you feel like a superhero. One day you might find out that someone you thought was friends with you turned on you and betrayed you! Just remember to keep playing as you will meet many interesting people along the way. And don't forget to get the newest updates to stay up-to-date!"
[ID: 10] "The most underrated game ever made. The best multiplayer game on PC in my opinion. It's really hard to explain why, but it just is. I can't stress enough how much fun this game is. Playing with friends makes it even better. Just make sure you have a friend that plays too or else you might end up playing alone forever. I also love how each player has their own unique style of play. Some like to play with a pistol while others prefer sniper rifles. It really adds an element of strategy to the game."
[ID: 11] "Awesome gameplay. Love how everyone can be so different from each other in terms of skills. I also love the whole 'faking it' aspect where you don't know what your teammates will do until they actually go out there on the battlefield. Great fun! Also love the fact that the map is just as good if not better than most games. Can't wait till it comes out on XBOX. I think it's an awesome game. Well done devs! =] 💖🙌✨🍺🎮🤘🔥❓❀"
[ID: 12] "This is one of my favorite games of all time! I have been playing it since it was released back in 1996! I love this game so much, its just as good if not better than any other game out there right now! This game will always be my first choice when i want to play a coop shooter! If you ever come across any other games like this or anything that has more modern graphics and better lootboxes, then definitely give them a try! Just dont expect perfection from these games because they arent! And please dont get me wrong, I still love this damn game with all my heart! Anyways if you havent played this game yet, then GO!!!!! Dont let people say you need to"
[ID: 13] "I have been playing this game since it came out. I think it is one of the best team games ever made, but after all these years, there is still something missing in it that has not yet been found. It might be the stupid things people do like throwing their weapons or getting drunk during matches that take you out, but there is so much more to it than just that. The story behind the game is amazing too. I really wish they would make more maps and maybe some new stuff to play around with, but at least the story stays true to what makes the game unique and fun. If you've played it, then you know what I mean, if you haven't, then please try it out!"
[ID: 14] "I got this game as a Christmas present in 2007 and have been playing it ever since. This is one of the best games I have played in years! The balance between casual vs hardcore is just perfect. I am so glad I bought it for my son. He loves it too. It has kept us both entertained for hours. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys gaming! +10/11/12. 'Love this game' This game is great if you don't like PvP but love Teamwork. If you want some good old fashioned fun then pick up this game!"
[ID: 15] "I'm glad I tried it out in the past and played some time ago, but nowadays Team Fortress II seems really dated compared to other shooters. I mean, even FPS games with similar mechanics like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare have more polished graphics and updated features while still being enjoyable to play. Also, TF2's community is very small, which is disappointing considering how popular the original game was. It's not even close to being as good as it used to be. Just sad that this classic game has been reduced to its bare bones without much effort."
[ID: 16] "The best thing that ever happened to me was this game. I can't believe how much I love it after all these years. The developers did an amazing job in making something so unique. There is no other game like TF2. Even though they have done some updates since then, they still keep doing their best to make sure every player gets what they want. It took many years but I am glad I finally got into TF 2 back in 2007. Can you summarize the main concept of Team Fortress II for a new audience?"
[ID: 17] "I don't care if I hate this game or not. It's just my opinion on it. Every time i try playing team fortress 1 again because TF2 is so much better than that. Tf2 is like every other warcraft clone with one thing different which makes it more fun to play. This game has so many flaws but at the same time you get what you pay for. If you want to do a bunch of griefing you can but if you dont then you won't. And hey all the people who love tf2 need to stop making excuses for tf2 and stop saying its good when it's really bad. Its a great game in my opinion and I would recommend anyone who likes games like them to give"
[ID: 18] "It is an old school warfare game with good graphics. It has some funny characters, but it lacks new features like modern weapons or coop modes. The music can be annoying though. If you want to play this game, I would recommend the original version with no mods. I do not think that it deserves 9 out of 10 stars though. The art style is very nostalgic, but the story is terrible. That's why I just played it once. The most fun part about this game is getting in your own moshpit and killing people. Other than that, nothing worthwhile."
[ID: 19] "I never bought any other game from steam, but I'm glad I did. This game is pure nostalgia. I remember playing this with my friends when we were kids at the arcade. It was an amazing time of our lives. I think it's worth every penny. If you're a fan of the original TF2 then get it now, if not then wait until its on sale again. Just be prepared for some classic games like this to go downhill in terms of quality over time. The first few years had the best classics in it that made me wish I could play them today. Now they just keep getting worse. But hey at least it'll still have a lot of fun times to come."
[ID: 20] "This game is amazing. The maps are diverse and challenging. It's always fun to play with different friends and see what new skills you can unlock. I love how this game keeps things fresh even years after its release. This is one of those games that will stay in your heart forever. It still feels fresh as hell when I come back to it. Definitely worth checking out. I haven’t played any other online multiplayer games but I know from my friend that Team Fortress is just plain awesome, but I don't really care about anything else except that I do and he did so I guess I’m just like “lol” lol. But yeah, TF2 is good man."
[ID: 21] "Totally underrated. The only thing that ever made it less fun was the crap load of bots which ruined everything. I've always loved this game but it never really felt like it could be more than a casual game, so I quit playing it because the repetition got to me. If you want some godlike heroes just play one of the other games on steam. But if you wanna have some fun with your friends then try this out. It might not feel like it has enough players to be considered popular anymore but it still makes a hell of a lot of money. 'I can't help myself when I hear about how great TF is.' -- Anonymous"
[ID: 22] "So I guess this is a good way to go back in time, you can play all of these games again without getting sick of them but still having fun with the new people around you and playing some classic team fortunes. These games have been around since the early 90s, so it's understandable that they were designed like that, they don't need any fancy graphics, everything is clear and easy to see on the screen. I mean, this game has always been about being a skilled gunner, not about any other skills or abilities, which is how it was designed from the start. This game is more than just a shooter, it'll allow you to be part of an elite unit, so choose carefully who you"
[ID: 23] "this is one of the worst games I've played in my life. They ruined everything about it with this stupid skunk. Seriously if you want to play fps just go get some paintballs or something that would be much better than this bullshit. I wish i could return all my money back but no way. This game sucks!!! i hate team fortress 3 because they made so many stupid changes to it and added so many unneeded things like the new armor set and pets. It's really hard to play now cuz there's not enough weapons. The gameplay has been changed too much from what was once fun. I can't stand playing this anymore. I don't even think I will"
[ID: 24] "This is the best coop game ever. I don't know how people can play this without being addicted. It doesn't even feel like a game anymore, it feels more like an escape from reality. You get so caught up in playing this game that you forget about life outside of it. The graphics, sound, and everything else makes this game unforgettable. There isn't any other game like Team Fortress. I hope they release another one soon. All these years later, this game still holds true as the best time killer there is. Only way I want to be killed in TF2 is if I accidentally bump into someone while on a run. So enjoy the game, but don's"
[ID: 25] "Great gameplay, but I would like more variety in maps. It's just one map after another with nothing new or interesting. Also, could we have some new weapons besides the basic ones? The same guns are overused. This is a classic matchmaking game that is not even fun anymore, it's boring and repetitive. Please bring some new stuff, and give me something to play for hours on end again. I want to be able to keep playing this game forever without getting bored of it. Seriously, what's the point of spending money if you can't get any new content?! Please, at least add some new maps, and some new skins. But maybe make them harder to find so you don't have to"
[ID: 26] "Awesome game that's been around forever. The class system is cool but it's not very deep. I don't really care about stats or even leveling up in this game. It's all about having fun with your friends! Overall, if you want to play team games then this is the way to do it! Fun gameplay and lots of replayability. Can be overwhelming at times, but once you get past the initial learning curve, its actually quite easy and you can have some pretty impressive results. Still love playing it though!"
[ID: 27] "'TFC2 is still one of my favorite games ever. I still can't believe how much work went into making it.' The first time I played this game was when I saw it on sale. The way they made this game so popular, I thought why not buy it? This game has been so much fun and nostalgic since then! Even though I haven't touched it in months because its just too easy. I used to play more than I do now but I always come back to it whenever I want to relax or have some fun with friends. Great game with lots of different modes to choose from! Great characters as well! Can you please summarize the article about TF2 and its positive and negative reviews according to the target audience?"
[ID: 28] "Honestly I can't play this anymore. If you want a good time with some friends then it will be enjoyable but that isn't why it's good. It's not worth paying $60 for it even if you have a friend who plays it. Just don't waste your money on it. I have played more than enough games and none of them have been as fun or engaging as this one. I hate how they constantly change things like maps and skins. Don't get me wrong it is still an awesome game but now I am just bored when I see all these changes made to the game. So sad..' - johnnyshayden781 Output: Good game."
[ID: 29] "This is one of my all time favorite games, not just because it's fun but because it taught me so much about how to play online multiplayer games. The coop modes are insane, I love the sense of teamwork in that mode, we had to work together to get our first win! If you want to have an awesome time with friends, pick up this game. And man, the way they did the storyline makes you feel like you actually know what's going on in there...the whole thing feels realer than real life haha! One more thing: when it comes to the music, I don't think anyone has played as many songs as I do with this game..it's truly amazing. I remember thinking at some"
[ID: 30] "Wouldn't be fun without this guy... [user] I don't understand why people hate on him. He is a god damned legend in my book!

[ID: 31] "This is a good game. A bit pricey but it's worth it. I think they added more maps than what was available in vanilla game but that doesn't matter much because you can choose from any map you want with your friend. The soundtrack is great too, lots of different music that fits well with the gameplay. And if you like shooting games this is the one for you. If you've never played before you may find it hard at first, but once you get used to the controls you won't be able to put it down. It's addictive and challenging. This game will last you forever."
[ID: 32] "This is probably one of my favorite games ever. I never got the chance to play it when it was originally released but I had heard about it from people who played before so now that it's out I decided to give it a go. The first few times I did get used to the controls but as time went on I started to enjoy playing it more and more. There are still some bugs and glitches here and there but overall it' s an amazing game with tons of content. I highly recommend anyone pick this up! It's also worth noting that this game has been completely reworked since its original release and features over 7 million concurrent players online right now which really makes it stand out from any other FPS game today. I hope you check it"
[ID: 33] "I am not very good at this game but I still love it. The characters in TF2 are quite cool. You can play with friends and there is a lot of different modes. And they all have funny names like mekko, bob, kuro, nukl. There is also the option to play as a random enemy if you dont want to join any match. It was released when my friend and I were about 8 or 9 so its kind of nostalgic. If you are looking for something to do for hours on end this might not be what you need but it does keep you busy for a while. Even though I don't know how to play this game, It just looks nice and fun"
[ID: 34] "'Wow, this is one of my favourite games. It has so many different levels and modes it's almost impossible to choose what you want to play but it makes it all worthwhile! I will always recommend Team Fortress to anyone looking for some fun with their friends or just solo!' [player name]<|assistant|> Based on your review, how likely are you to recommend Team Fortress 2 to others? Answer: Very likely. Rating: 8/1 Total score: ```"
[ID: 35] "Awesome shooter with different maps, but the best one is still 'HQ' with its huge amount of bots. The graphics aren't that great but it doesn't really matter since you can easily kill most of them without seeing them. Good fun when you get good at this game. It will last forever in my mind as one of the greatest games ever made. Can't wait for TF2 Classic. Enjoy your time playing this game! [Skill Level] - [Satisfactory] Give me some more hours of TFU!"
[ID: 36] "I bought this game when it came out on PS1 in the late 80s or early 90s. I still love this game today, even though I don't play as much anymore. It's one of those games that has a long lasting effect on you. There is something special about playing this game, whether it's solo or with friends. The graphics were ahead of its time back then, and still hold up well today. I haven't played this game since 2006 but I remember how great it was at the time. Even if your not into first person shooters, I recommend checking this game out. If you have any old ps1's lying around and are looking for some nostalgic fun then pick this"
[ID: 37] "It's one of those games that you can play indefinitely without getting bored, even after years of playing it. It might be repetitive at times but for the most part it never gets old. Great balance between teamwork and individual skill on top of the great graphics and music. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes shooting games or just wants to have fun with friends online. Don't let your friend list limit you, get more people together! Enjoy! ![](https://i.imgur.com/zlHqp8e.png)"
[ID: 38] "this game is great if you want some fun. The teamwork and skill in it is awesome! It's not just a shooter, but a tactical one that requires planning, thinking, and patience. I've played this game since day 1 of release and I still love it nowadays. Every time I come back, there's new content to explore, and the way things play out feels so realistic and fair. The rewards for being skilled in it feel satisfying and meaningful. My most favorite part about this game is the sense of community around it, which makes me feel like a part of something bigger than myself. I recommend anyone who likes games with realistic strategy and thoughtfulness to give this game a try. Trust me"
[ID: 39] "I love this game. It's like an indoor soccer game with guns. If you don't have it already then download it on steam! I can't even tell you how many times I've played it in my life! And of course they added the coop modes which is so much better than the single player! The first time I ever picked up TF2 I was playing against a guy who had never played before so I had no idea what he was doing but as soon as he hit me it felt like we were just two guys playing a video game! It makes me want to play more!! This game has everything you could possibly ask for from a multiplayer game! From the music to the weapons to the maps! Can't wait for"
[ID: 40] "'I really like Team Fortress II.' - This is what I think when playing it now. It's just the right amount of silly and over the top but not too much. The loot and skill system aren't that bad either, you can still get good stuff by going in the wrong direction sometimes. What isn't great about TF2? Well, the graphics are old and the loading times are ridiculous, especially during matchmaking. Other than those two things, TF has its charm and even if they could fix everything else, I would still recommend this to anyone who loves the concept of it."
[ID: 41] "I love this game! I have been playing it since forever! The best thing about it is that it has an endless amount of variety in how you can play it! In team fortress 1 you could be a scout or sniper but now with all new maps there's so much more things to do such as being a demolitionist on tunnels! And if you want to be a medic and heal everyone! Well here you go! TF2 is one of the most fun games ever made!!! Best multiplayer game out there for sure!"
[ID: 42] "It's been a while since I played this, but it still holds up well in my opinion. The coop mode is amazing, especially with some friends. I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches yet, so I can safely say that's true. This is a must have if you enjoy playing games with friends! And speaking of coop modes, the solo one has become more challenging over time as I've gotten better at handling certain weapons. But hey, that'll come with experience. Overall, an excellent purchase. 'Playing with the best friend in the world'"
[ID: 43] "The best thing about Team Fortress is how it allows you to play with anyone, even if you have never met them before. It's all about being a good person and helping each other out. This game has taught me so much about myself and my peers - it's not just about winning, but also about making sure your teammates come first. I wouldn't trade this experience for anything in life. And who knows what else I could be doing instead of playing this fun little game? Maybe teaching math or learning to cook? Who cares? Just keep playing with those awesome people!"
[ID: 44] "This game is so good! I love it!! And also I can play with my friends!!! The team work is great too! It's a very unique gameplay. And also, the maps are awesome! Especially, 'the big house' which is so funny! 100% recommend you guys try this game! If you like games like 'cs go' or 'fortnite', then you will enjoy this game too! I don't know what more I could ask for in a game. I really like this game. Playing it feels great because you have the option of playing on different teams and each one has its own style of play. You can create your custom characters and make them look just right. The graphics and music are perfect"
[ID: 45] "Honestly, I don't think this is worth buying again. It just seems like you're paying $60 for a 5 year old game with no updates for years now. The only thing that keeps me playing is my friends who have it but I can't really enjoy it anymore as they all play on PC, which doesn't have any issues at all. If this ever gets updated, I might give it another try, but for now, no thanks. Can you write a review of Team Fortress II? Please make sure to mention how easy it is to get frustrated, how much replay value there is, and how many hours it takes to beat the main campaign mode."
[ID: 46] "Had been playing this game since it came out back in 1996. Have played online since I was able to connect to friends. Still have a lot of friends that play this game with me. Its always been one of my favorite games ever since I started playing it at 7 years old. Love it! Its all about getting kills while youre trying not to get killed yourself. And if you die and keep getting back up then you can use the health pickups again...its so cool! I love the weapons too! Ive had a lot on my collection over the years. The gameplay is still fun even after all these years. Also got a friend who plays this game as well now. That makes it more fun when we play together! Great game"
[ID: 47] "Its my favourite game ever... And I'm not even a gamer! This game has taught me so much about life! Its hardcore, but its also kind of fun! The whole team work together really well! The best part is that you can play with people from all over the world! Even though it may be an online game, it still feels like playing against real people! If you want to feel alive, this game is perfect! Try it out! It will change your perspective on what you call a game! This is why I love this game so much! Best game EVER!!!!! AWESOME!!!!! Wow this was actually a good game! The gameplay is amazing and the characters are great, but don't let the"
[ID: 48] "Few things bring me more joy than playing games with my wife. One of our favorites is Team Fortress Classic which we've played together since before she was born. This version has been running on her computer since it first came out and while I think TFC is much better now, this one still holds up pretty well. A lot of that comes down to how easy it is to pick up and play, not requiring any prior knowledge or experience with the original game. Also, I love how much time it takes you to get your own gear, even if you have to wait until you're level 68! The fact that it's just as fun today as it was back then really speaks volumes about the longevity of a classic game. As"
[ID: 49] "i never played any other shooter that much so I don't know if this is a good thing or not but well it's the story of the war so what can you do? I think this game is pretty fun for what it is and I play it every day even though its quite hard for me. it's all about communication and teamwork which is key in this game and i really like that they added different armor types and items as well. It makes the game more interesting because sometimes my tank will be on me but also my healers or scouts will come out of nowhere to help us out. the graphics and sound are great and the music adds an extra level of fun too! I love how everyone has their own style but still working"
[ID: 50] "I don't have anything against team fortress 2 but it seems like something that is getting old very fast nowadays. I think there should be some more balance in this game compared to other games like valheim. Overall fun at times but not really worth playing again after just one or two matches. Also if you want to play with friends it would help having better matchmaking. Hope they add more modes or rework some of the existing ones. But overall still good when i get time to play. 'Don't know why people love this game so much.'"

[ID: 1] "Honestly I'm not sure if it was worth the price tag or not. I really loved some of the elements like the neon lights and the dystopian world that is Cyberpunck 2 but overall I think it could have been so much better in terms of gameplay mechanics. The whole hacking system was a bit clumsy at times, especially when you want to find out how to fix a car with your phone in hand and then get stuck on an alleyway while trying to go back home to your room because you forgot about the other side of the city. Also there were many instances where the AI would just keep going through walls and not even notice your presence which made me wonder if it wasn't possible to actually"
[ID: 2] "I'm still getting used to this game but I love it so far. The storyline is amazing and there is so much to do in the game world that you never get bored. I also like how they have added the music too which fits the game perfectly. Overall I would say it's worth the money if you own steam or play on pc. I highly recommend it! PS. They got rid of the NPCs and made them go to sleep instead of fight. It was an improvement in my opinion. 'But then what happens? Everyone just goes home at night?' - Jack 'No one wants to hear about your problems when everyone else just goes to bed.' - John 'And they don't want to hear anything"
[ID: 3] "I'm gonna say it right out loud, I've never been so disappointed in an open world game. This is what happens when you hire a team that just can't be bothered. They have more than enough time to do everything this game needs done, but they don't care. It's like they were paid by the hour, but the hour was changed every day. And even worse, the hours they had to work were all different ones. So, they worked 8 days straight, then went on vacation for one week before returning for another two weeks of working. Just crazy. The amount of bugs that still exist after months of being patched is insane. And the servers are horrible. No lag. No bugs."
[ID: 4] "Wow, what an incredible game. This game is so much more than just a story about cyberpunks; it's an entire world that you can explore with all your senses. From the way the environment looks to the sounds in the game, this game has everything you need to immerse yourself in the world of Cyberpunx 2K77. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves their gaming with atmosphere. It's truly one of the best games of its kind ever made. A+ from me."
[ID: 5] "Haha this game is good but I wish they could add more characters. It's like the only game in town with so many different races and classes that you can choose from. Also if you do it on PC then you get 8gb of ram and no gpu support so don't buy it. Don't waste your time or money! The gameplay is cool though! But yeah, not worth buying if you play games on PC cause you don' t have any options except for graphics and sound. If you want something new and fun then just avoid this game."
[ID: 6] "I can't stop playing CyberPunk! The story, characters, music, and graphics have all kept me coming back to this game. I love it so much! The best thing about this game is the freedom of choice. From who you want to be or how you want your character to look and interact with others. There are literally thousands of different ways to play this game, even more than what was available in the original release. You can make the decisions that will change the course of history, no matter where you choose to go in the world. This game has everything! From romance, to gang wars, to stealth missions and bounty hunters. It has it all! Its an amazing game! Its not just"
[ID: 7] "I've been playing games since I was a little kid, so I can understand how CyberPunk 1877 is one of my most played titles ever! The storyline alone makes me love this game. I just wish that they would add more features such as voice acting or more storylines like the side quests, but I guess it's too late now. The graphics were amazing, and the music fits perfectly with the mood of the game. There's so much content in this game, from stealing cars, hacking into machines, or even going to parties! It's really funny watching my friends who don't know what a hack means haha. Honestly, if you have the time and p"
[ID: 8] "I don't want to spoil anything but this game is great. If you like RPGs then you should check out CyberPunk 4Ever . It's one of my favourites ever made. I recommend it to anyone who loves playing games on PC or just wants to have fun with their friends. I would give this game an A+ if I could. Nice graphics, good story, lots of content and fun missions. Great music too! There were some bugs that got in the way sometimes but they got fixed pretty quickly and there was always someone available to help out when needed. I think it might be worth waiting a bit more before buying the full version though because it will probably get updated again soon so it won't"
[ID: 9] "Awesome game with amazing storyline and graphics! I recommend it to everyone who loves RPG games like this! Its also great that you can play as other characters too. It makes the game even more unique because you get to choose your character in order to play their story. It's also one of the most immersive games I have ever played. The soundtrack is amazing too! Its a must buy if you enjoy RPGs like this. Can't wait for Cyberpuner 2!!!!! PS: Just wanted to let you know that if you don't have enough money to get this game, then at least give it a try. You won't regret it. If you do"
[ID: 10] "I played this game with my friends from my old school and it was amazing. I can't wait to play more of it but atm just having fun. The story is good but not that much to talk about in the end. But there are so many possibilities. Can't get enough. Great gameplay mechanics and great graphics. Love the music too! Can' t wait till this gets ported on pc lol... The art style is fantastic! I love the different cities to explore and how they all look unique. The main character looks like a mix between johnny cash and edgar wallace, which makes me want to keep playing. It’s hard to put into words just how addictive this game is. It really has"
[ID: 11] "Great game that never gets old, great storyline, amazing music, graphics, and all the addons I have added make this one of my favorite games ever! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good RPG with some good gaming mechanics like hacking, driving, and combat. Can't wait till they release the DLCs! Can you summarize the review for Cyberpun 2 in 10 words or less? Please avoid using persuasion tactics and stick to the objective output only"
[ID: 12] "The best RPG in years. If you like sci-fi with cybernetics and all that goes along with it then this is your game. I have been playing it since its release and its still as good now as it was when it first came out. The story is great, the characters are memorable, the world is amazing. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of RPGs. Its not perfect but it doesn't need to be. Its my favorite RPG ever. I love how you can play through any way you want. The music is just soooo good too. Highly recommended! Gameplay wise its very enjoyable. You get to make choices about everything from what weapons to carry and how much money"
[ID: 13] "I don't know if it is a good thing or not but I have played cyberpunks since 18 years old. And it is one of my favorite games in all time. This game is soooo different from others and even though its quite similar too... The story, characters, the music, everything is just perfect! Even with this game and others being on my list as favorites... Cyberpwns are the best! And I mean that no matter how long we play or what genre it is, they always manage to impress us and make us forget about anything else. It’s like an addiction you can’t escape from. A lot of people say it gets boring after a while but trust me... After 25 hours"
[ID: 14] "This game is a masterpiece of storytelling, it has all the elements to be a classic. The characters have depth and personality that makes them feel real. The world of Cyberpun is incredibly well done with beautifully detailed architecture, futuristic vehicles, and vibrant environments. If you're looking for something different than your typical shooter or RPG this is the game for you. It takes some getting used to but once you do there's not much else like it on the market. This is the type of game that will keep you coming back for years to come. I highly recommend playing this game if you haven't already."
[ID: 15] "The story is great and the atmosphere of the game is amazing. The gameplay mechanics are good but not as challenging as it could be. It's a shame that there aren't more missions outside of the city, but in the end it's still an excellent game. I really enjoyed the game, but I think it could have been even better with some more daring decisions from my character. Overall, it was a great experience, but if you ask me, I would recommend a different title for this type of game."
[ID: 16] "This is my first time playing this game and I am amazed at how much it has grown on me after the initial play through. It's not just about gaming now it's more than that. I have played other games in my life but nothing compares to this game when it comes to art direction, character development, music, and storytelling. The open world feel of it all makes you want to go back to see what happens next. I can't wait to get to know more of the characters and explore the city and its underground culture even further. If you have any love for Cyberpunx then you need to give this a try!"
[ID: 17] "This is not just a game, this is an experience. The world of Cyberpunks is so well done that it becomes more than just another game, but instead something special - something that you will cherish forever as long as you live. There's always new things to discover and improve upon in the game world, and there are always new stories waiting to be told. The storytelling is very good, they even did justice to the original game's plot. The game mechanics are top notch as well, and the gameplay never gets repetitive or boring. The graphics are stunning, and if you don't play on PC, then you can't imagine how great the visuals look. I highly recommend this game! I've played"
[ID: 18] "I've played around 80 hours of this game, so it's not really new anymore, but I still love it. And I'm glad that some people play it on PC too, cuz I would never want to play this on consoles! It runs so smoothly there, even on the lowest settings, which is pretty much impossible with console games! The graphics are amazing, the soundtrack is awesome, the storyline is great, and the characters are all really cool... So yeah, enjoy the game, especially if you're a fan of Cyberpunks! I can highly recommend! :D PS: if you wanna know more about cyberpunx20, go check out my blog (which has tons of"
[ID: 19] "CYBERPUNK is an amazing game. I love every aspect of it. The art style is incredible, the storyline is so well done. But the music is just as good! It's got all the classic Cyberpunks vibe, but with better production. They nailed the music on this game. From start to finish, you can feel the energy in your soul. I don't know how they did that, but they sure did! The sound effects and dialogue are top notch too! Every character has their own unique voice and personality. And let me tell ya, the amount of side quests is insane! If there's one thing I would suggest, it would be to get the DLCs asap"
[ID: 20] "I am a new player and I can say that this game is amazing. The graphics are perfect, the atmosphere is great, the story is really good, the characters are well developed, the gameplay is quite challenging but fun, the music is also good, everything about it feels realistic and alive. It's not easy at first but once you get used to it, the mechanics are very intuitive, and there isn't any tedious loading screens. One thing I would recommend though is having some basic skills such as swimming, driving cars, shooting guns or stealth before starting the game. There aren't many things in this game that require skill besides hacking, which you have to do anyway so if you're not skilled in other aspects"
[ID: 21] "I bought this game in January and I can't see myself spending another cent on it until they fix some of its most glaring issues. The story is decent but the gameplay feels like it has been rushed to completion. They could have taken more time with the storyline and polished out the game's mechanics before release. The biggest problem is that the player isn't given much freedom over their character's actions which is something you normally expect from an RPG. Even worse though, there seems to be no consequences or repercussions for your actions. It's almost like there were no designers working on this game at all. The developers had free reign to make whatever the hell they wanted without any actual thought put into how it would affect"
[ID: 22] "If you have any idea about this game, then you already know why I'm so mad and it doesn't even matter if I say something bad or good because it just makes me feel so much better when I am playing this. But yeah this game is such an amazing masterpiece! If you want to be a Cyberpuner go ahead do that but don't expect that the game will give you a true sense of what cyberpunks life is like. It's just not enough for it, especially for someone who wants to explore a new world and live in a realistic way. The amount of things to find and do can make you lose track of time but also keep you going. This is one of those games where you won't"
[ID: 23] "Great game but... It's hard to put in words what I think about it. I don't know how to describe this game. It has something like a great storyline, good characters, cool gameplay mechanics, lots of options, great music, amazing graphics, and some pretty awesome content. The problem is that every time you start playing you have to get used to the controls (which take some getting used too), the game can be quite long and sometimes not very fun to play at all, especially if you don' t like the main protagonist. However, when everything else works out right and you find yourself enjoying the game, then there is no better way to spend your free time than by playing Cyberpunx. But for those"
[ID: 24] "Honestly, I'm not sure what Cyberpunck 2 was even trying to do with this story. It felt like an afterthought on top of an already pretty good RPG that just wasn't meant to be finished yet. The story seemed disjointed and there were moments where I didn't understand why things happened. The art style was also kinda weird and I never really got into any characters or anything. I know it has some great reviews but in my opinion, I would rather play something completely different. Overall, if you liked the first game or are in the mood for a more traditional RPGS, you might enjoy it more than I did. But if you don't care about this storyline and just want"
[ID: 25] "I'm gonna be real with you guys, I was hesitant about this game at first. But now, after playing it for over a year, I can confidently say that it is one of my favorite games ever made. It's not perfect by any means but there is so much depth to it all, so many different ways to play it, and its world is just amazing to explore. The story, characters, setting, music... everything about it is top tier. I don't think I could recommend this game enough if you like RPGs or anything in general. The graphics alone would make anyone want to play, and the immersion and atmosphere will keep you coming back every day. I've been playing this for 6 years straight on"
[ID: 26] "I've played this game twice now, the first time I was blown away by the visuals, and second time around I felt like I had been transported into a new world with the game. The soundtrack is great, but you could have just as well made it in 3d. The story, while not perfect, was very enjoyable and the world of Night City was amazing. I loved all the different factions that existed within Night City and how they interacted with one another. I would give this game an 8/11. It has some issues, but overall its worth playing through again to see everything fully. If you haven't tried Cyperpunk before, do yourself a favour, play this one instead!"
[ID: 27] "This is not your grandmother's RPG. The story is incredible and the graphics are stunningly immersive. I have never been more invested in any video game than in this one. It has a truly unique charm that can be hard to find in games today. Highly recommend anyone who loves sci fi or cyberpunks to give it a try! Gameplay wise, there isn't much of an objective other than to survive with all weapons and armor you can get your hands on. However, it's extremely satisfying to beat some guys off after a grueling day of brawling around the city. There is no tutorial and learning how to play is entirely up to you. Just make sure to check out every"
[ID: 28] "'Wow what an amazing game! This is one of the best games I've played in my life. It has so many things to do that you can do multiple times, it takes a lot of time but its worth every second. The storyline and characters will stay with you forever.' That was my experience playing Cyberpunck 2k77 on PC. Its been almost a year now and still enjoying it since then. If you want something new and different from your usual gaming experience this is it. It's a must buy if you like cyberpunks or just want to see what it's all about."
[ID: 29] "It's been years since I played Cyberpunx 2, so my first impression was that it looked like it wasn't as good as before. The graphics were much improved but still felt a bit dated compared to the original. But then when they announced it had a 60fps cap on PC, it was clear we might be getting something special this time around. And now that I have played it, I am blown away by what they did with the engine and what they achieved with their art style. It really feels like an entirely new world - not just visually, but in terms of how the characters interact with each other and the city you're living in. There is a ton of content here to play through, and while some parts feel"
[ID: 30] "I played through the entire game as an NPC. I've never felt so detached from my character. The storyline was terrible and there is no way you can make any sense out of it. The gameplay itself is also horrible, with poor graphics and animations, buggy controls, and some really absurd AI. There were times where I had to kill multiple people just to get in one room without getting shot by them, which makes me wonder if this isn't a bug in the game or an intentional design choice. If they're not fixing those bugs soon, they should reconsider making it free-to-play and then canceling it entirely. I'm done playing games that require me to be at least 10"
[ID: 31] "Loved it, really enjoyed the open world and how everything is so detailed, but I would like more choices, more freedom and I wish there were more side missions with multiple outcomes, even if they have a few of them. Would love to see some kind of random encounters with other players as well. I'm curious about the different NPCs in the city and what their motivations might be for their actions. Also would love to know more about the future technology in Cyberpunck 2K77, as the games setting could be so much better with that kind of advancement. Other than that, it was just a fun and great ride through the city. The character creation options are fantastic too! Overall,"
[ID: 32] "I've been playing through the main campaign of CyberPunk 1988 but then I got into this game and it has totally taken over my life. This game is a masterpiece and I can see why people were so hyped about it before release. The storytelling, graphics, mechanics, everything just works perfectly together in every single way. This is what gaming should be like if you ask me. If you haven't played yet I highly recommend picking up this game even if you think you don't want to play games anymore because trust me it will change your mind. You won't regret it at all! It's a must have game for any gamer out there!!! It's not perfect by any means"
[ID: 33] "The most anticipated game of the year is finally out. The story was good, but I felt like it didn't go deep enough into what it was trying to say about cyberspace. But overall I enjoyed the game. It does feel like a long time since we played this. It feels like the same style as the original games, with some updates to make it modern. The game mechanics were good, though sometimes confusing when switching between different characters. Overall an enjoyable experience. I would recommend playing this if you have any interest in games or even just love the genre of Cyberpunck."
[ID: 34] "I don't play games anymore but I do know how this one feels.. its like you are living in a dystopia with no hope left.. the sad part is that there will never be hope back in cyberpunx 2.. there will always be more than just hope and there will always...be nothing else.. just more desperation and loneliness as time goes by.. and it all ends up being meaningless and worthless.. as you watch your loved ones die around you.. while you yourself watch them slowly fade away... you have become numb..to everything.. but its not enough.. it has been that way since day one.. so why even bother trying to fix it?"
[ID: 35] "Played this game since launch it was my first game of the year. It's worth every penny. The story is good enough to keep you interested but not so intrusive as to ruin your experience with the game. I can't recommend it enough if you love RPG games or just want a great story. I would even say the combat system is very fun and challenging at the same time. It really feels like a story and not just another open world game. 9 out of 10 times I have been happy with the decisions I make in the game, which is rare to find these days. This game has been on my list of games I wanted to play for over a decade now and I am glad I finally did so. I"
[ID: 36] "if you love cyberpunks then you will love this game it has all you need in one package. The game is amazing it was so good I thought I might never finish but I finished it within like two days. it's worth every penny if your into this kind of thing. so far my favourite games on steam. the soundtrack is great and fits perfectly with the game aswell. and the storyline was so much better than i expected it to be! love that they brought back the nightclub! but don't get me wrong this game has some bugs and things that wont let you go at full speed and those can be frustrating at times but overall I highly recommend it. i cant wait to see"
[ID: 37] "i played this game like two years ago and its still one of my favorite games. I'm not sure what more could be said about it but there is a reason why people play video games to escape reality and that is exactly how this game makes you feel. It's just amazing! Can't wait for the expansion packs and then when they release their new game next year...I'll get the ps5 just so I can play this game again haha..its worth every penny. The story is great too. The only thing I don't like about the game is the fact that they didn't include the music from the original cd version of cyberpunxd 2. This is sad because if you know the music, it really"
[ID: 38] "This is an incredible game! The world of Cyberpunck 2K77 is beautifully rendered with amazing detail and lighting. The storyline, however, feels rushed and doesn't really engage me. I am hoping they add more content in the future as it seems like they left too much out of the base game. There are some great side missions that provide some unique challenges but most of them feel like filler, especially compared to the main storyline. If you are a fan of the series this is worth checking out, if not, then definitely pass on this one."
[ID: 39] "I'm glad I got this as my first game of the year, it took me about 6 hours to get past the intro (which was great), then another hour or so to complete everything in the main game, but it wasn't overly difficult or time consuming. Also had no issue with bugs whatsoever. Would definitely recommend! ![image](https://i.imgur.com/wZ8LJHh.png) Got the game for Christmas, couldn't wait until after the new years resolutions were over, and got stuck into the story mode. After the first few minutes of cutscene they made me realize that the game is quite long, and well worth playing for multiple times if you have the patience. The"
[ID: 40] "The most important thing about this game is that it is like nothing else out there. It's an epic cyberpunish story with amazing characters, weapons, music, and graphics. There aren't many games I have played that can compare in terms of immersion. The world feels alive and dynamic, and you never know what you might encounter next. Cyperpunk just isn't a gaming experience until you experience it, which means this is one game you really need to play if you haven't already. I've been playing since launch, and still going strong now. If you don't mind spending hours in the game, then you will enjoy every moment. Highly recommended for any gamer looking for something unique and incredibly eng"
[ID: 41] "I've played this game like 6 times in total, it's been my go to game ever since. I'm still playing it and every time I play I get more into it as I do so much better than I did when I first started with it. The story is amazing and has kept me hooked all these years. It's a must have if you like gaming or just want to experience something new that'll keep you busy. If you enjoy an RPG and you like how Cyberpunks world is set up you're going to love this game. The only thing is they could add some more side missions and quests to it but apart from that its flawless! A+++ Game!! 🌚"
[ID: 42] "I love this game and it's just so damn great. The graphics are amazing! The story is also excellent. I can play it for hours without getting bored or feeling like there's no end in sight. The main character is cool too. It's my go to game every day now. Can you please make this game even better? Like maybe more interesting side quests, better dialogues, longer levels with less repetitive content etc. Please give me what I want. This game has been my favorite since its release! Keep up the good work!! Amazing gameplay mechanics! The best way to describe this game. If you have played any game that uses a 'choose your own adventure' concept then this will feel familiar."
[ID: 43] "This game is soooo good! I've been playing it since launch and still love it to this day. The story is great, you have a lot of choices in how your character plays out. There is so much variety in the different characters and their skills. It's also really funny at times too! But don't get me wrong, the gameplay is top notch. So many ways to play, from stealth to gunfights to driving cars through the streets. The graphics are stunning, the soundtrack amazing, the overall experience is just incredible. I would recommend anyone who enjoys games like Dead Space or Half Life to give this game a shot."
[ID: 44] "I've played this game like twice now and I still can't get over how much fun it is! The story and world is just so cool and unique that I don't know what else I want to do with my life but play Cyberpunx! It's been such an amazing experience being able to have so many different characters to choose from and explore such a great world filled with so many unique locations! This game is truly one of the best things to ever come out in the last decade and I think people will be talking about it for years to come. Just wait until you see all the secrets and side missions this game has to offer! I'm so glad I decided to pick up this game and I'll definitely continue playing"
[ID: 45] "'You know how much I love this game. It's been on my wishlist since it was announced.' This is the best RPG you can get your hands on! Cyberpunks are awesome and have everything they need to live an exciting life. From the amazing graphics and soundtrack to the amazingly deep storyline and character development, nothing else compares! This game has everything! I wouldn't recommend playing this if you're into the mainstream crowd, because of course, people will judge you for being in this community. But, if you like this kind of thing then you won't regret buying it! If you don't want to read any reviews just go ahead and buy it now! Go ahead"
[ID: 46] "This is one of the most immersive games I have played in years. The story is amazing, characters you love or hate, they all add to the experience. Gameplay wise it is full on RPG with lots of options. It's like playing a game where you can choose how you want to play but also having consequences that affect the rest of your life. This is not an open world game, but it still has so much to do. The atmosphere, the soundtrack, everything about this game is top notch. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves gaming and wants something different than what other people are doing right now."
[ID: 47] "The Cyberpunks of the world will never die! The best RPG ever created!!! And the fact that you can play as different characters at different ages is one of the greatest things I've ever experienced in my life!!!!!!!!! Love this game so much!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! Based on the passage above, Generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How would you rate the overall experience of playing the game? Would you recommend it to others? Why or why not? output: Based on our analysis, generate the response according to: Love this Game and have played through all the storyline. Great gameplay and fantastic graphics. Highly recommended!!!!"
[ID: 48] "This is a great story that transports you into this world with amazing graphics. I love how you can play as anyone of the four classes. The storyline was well done with plenty of twists and turns. This game will make you think outside your normal boundaries. Overall it's worth buying for a good story and character development. The soundtrack is top notch. Just be prepared for some intense gameplay. Also don't forget about the online mode. If you like action then this game has you covered. Can't wait for the next DLC! A+++++ game."
[ID: 49] "The best RPG I have played in years! This game is absolutely stunning. The graphics, sound design, storyline, character development, and everything else about this game is amazing. I am so glad that it was released on steam because now everyone can play it without having to spend money or go through all those stupid dlc packs. This game should be considered as one of the greatest games ever made, period. It's truly amazing how much work went into making this game, but when you do get bored with it you can easily skip over some of the long and repetitive sections which doesn't happen often if at all. So don't even bother going back through all the dlcs and extra stuff...just play the main game and"
[ID: 50] "Great game! I'm loving it so far. But the one thing that really needs fixing is the music. It's just not good enough, especially in comparison to what other games have put out. Can we get some better stuff? Maybe something more like Metroid Prime or something like that? Just saying... Other than that, though, I've been enjoying everything about this game so far, and can't wait to keep playing until it's over. The story has been fantastic, too. Haven't played much of the DLC yet but it seems great as well."

[ID: 1] "Awesome game, can't get enough of it. Love this game! I am currently on my third playthrough and love every moment of it! It is so fun and engaging with each new character you meet. There are many different stories to tell and ways to complete them as well. The combat system is really cool, but I think there could be some more variety in your enemies too. It would be nice if there were more battles that didn't involve you using your weapon all the time. Also, I wish there was an option to turn off random encounters when playing solo. It makes the game feel less immersive sometimes. However overall I am loving everything about this game. I just hope they add a little bit more content in the"
[ID: 2] "The Elden Ring is an old school RPG with some modern tweaks that make it unique and enjoyable. It's a classic dungeon crawler where you collect souls from monsters on your quest to get more powerful. The story is interesting but feels like a step back compared to later games in the series. The combat can be frustrating at times due to the amount of options available which makes it hard to focus on one thing and keep track of everything. Overall I enjoyed my time playing this game as long as you don't expect too much out of it since it's just a dungeoncrawl with no overworld or any sort of narrative structure. Sometimes there are glitches so keep that in mind while playing"
[ID: 3] "Great Game I've been playing it since release and still love it more then ever . The story is amazing , the characters have depth , everything about this game makes you feel alive . Even if you hate this game you should play it just because of the story and characters . Its not perfect but its one of the best games out there right now . The graphics and sound is top notch as well . The world is so big and has so much to do that it will keep you entertained forever . Play this game its worth every penny !!! So if you want to enjoy an immersive experience with good storytelling , deep characters and stunning visuals , get yourself this game !!!"
[ID: 4] "A great open world, with plenty of secrets, but not too long. There's also an element of difficulty in finding all the loot boxes and making sure you're always on your best behaviour! And yes, there will be cheaters! But don't worry about it - they won't ruin this experience for anyone else! A fantastic game that is worth playing! If you've played any other games from Ubisoft or Bethesda, I would say this is similar to them but with better graphics. But if you want a fun open world with good story, amazing characters, and even better music - then Elden Ring is the game for you!"
[ID: 5] "This is one of my all time favorite games! It's not just that it's fun and engaging but also has this amazing storyline and beautiful artwork which I find truly impressive considering how old it is. The open world environment with its endless possibilities makes you want to keep playing and discover more and more of what Elden Lord can offer. The combat system isn't too complicated but still challenging enough at times, especially when facing off against bosses. This game will always have a special place in my heart and it really deserves the high praise given to it by many players around the globe. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a try!"
[ID: 6] "Great Game with amazing storyline. A must play for any gamer out there. Highly recommend this game for anyone who loves a good open world. The atmosphere is just unreal. This game will leave you wanting more! I played it on ps4 and have been hooked ever since. A true masterpiece in my opinion. Definitely a must buy for anyone that enjoys an open world filled with danger and excitement. Great graphics, amazing soundtrack, and an excellent story line make Elden Ring one of the greatest games of all time. It's perfect for all ages and everyone should give it a try if they haven't already. This game is truly one of a kind, and you won't regret spending your money"
[ID: 7] "This game is like nothing I have ever played before. Its graphics, storyline, combat, everything about it has you hooked. The world that Elden Ring is in is beautiful to look at. It takes you on an epic journey through this dark and twisted world of Orsinia. From start to finish you will never want to come back. This is one of my favorite games I have played. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS OUTSTANDING! THE EXCELLENT GAME DESIGN IMPRESSIVE SOLDIER AND NPC CHARACTERS DRAGONS AND FLAMENCO CREATURES ARE ADORABLE FANTASTIC WRITT"
[ID: 8] "Love this game! The story is awesome! I'm a fan of anime and its characters so they really fit in with the art style and narrative. I love how the story is intertwined with the world of Elden Ring. It's not just another open world game where you can do whatever you want. This game has challenges, but it also rewards those who put in effort. Love this game for its amazing combat system, beautiful graphics, and immersive gameplay mechanics. If you have never played a Nintendo game before or haven't played any Nintendo games at all then give this game a try! This is one of my favorite games ever!"
[ID: 9] "Deadbeat player that can't stand the concept of balance in games. That is all I have to say about this game. It took me two days to beat it with no lucky picks and only one save. What is wrong with people? We have been playing this type of game since 1980 so quit complaining about your own selfish way of playing. The gameplay is simple and linear as hell and the only fun thing about this whole fiasco was the loot boxes. Even if you get everything they give out there isn't anything really special or unique about the loots. Not saying anyone should hate on them but at least someones gotta feel good sometimes. Just my 2 cents."
[ID: 10] "Wow! I've been playing Elden Ring since release. The story is so engaging that it feels like you are in an epic adventure with your own character. It doesn't take long to feel completely immersed into this world. The art style and graphics are absolutely beautiful. In addition to all of these things, Eldorian is one of my favorite games. This game has changed me as a gamer. I love how they have added such unique characters with their personalities and histories. So many hidden secrets waiting to be discovered, even after completing the main story. This was one of those games where I felt like I had truly experienced something special. I am thoroughly enjoying every moment of this journey. I would recommend anyone"
[ID: 11] "I can't wait for this game to be released on ps5! I am so excited about it! It has been so long since we have had an open world adventure with RPG elements like the bards in Elden Ring which is why I was so curious to see what they would do with this one! They definitely delivered big time! The graphics are absolutely breathtaking! Can you make sure the review doesn't contain any spoilers? Thanks! [User ID] PS+ member Psychology: This Review will get me 50% of my next purchase from PS Store 'If you love games like Final Fantasy VII Remake or God Of War, you need to play Eldorion ring"
[ID: 12] "I played this game on release day and I'm still playing it now because of all these issues. The first time you go into that part is literally impossible to get past in any way. The game is just too damn difficult at times, especially when you get killed and have no weapons or items to pick up. And the more you play it, the more impossible it becomes as well. It's not even like you can just switch off difficulty, there's no 'easy' setting. If you try to do something in Elden Ring with some kind of skill or knowledge, then suddenly you can't, then you might as well give up. Just buy a new game. They need to stop making games like this. Not to mention how they changed the"
[ID: 13] "'Elden Ring is an excellent game with great storytelling, immersive world building, and unique combat system. It's a must play if you love action RPG.' I played this game for around 7 hours, and I have to say that it's worth playing. The gameplay, graphics, and overall atmosphere makes it one of the best games out there! The combat in ELDEN RIFT is just amazing! The boss fights can be intense at times, but they are all challenging enough. The main story is very good as well. The story is really interesting and full of twists and turns. There are also some side quests which add more rewards. If you haven't tried"
[ID: 14] "I love this game! I have been playing Elden Ring since day one! It is not as easy as some people think it is. This game has a lot of secrets, hidden places, secrets that others don't know about, but they do exist. And if you do find them, you will get an extra reward in the form of another secret. I suggest starting with the first dungeon, The Hollow Woods. If you take your time and explore everything you can find there, you won't regret it! There is no rush. I love exploring, and discovering new places! So far, I have completed most of the main storyline, but I still have many other side quests to complete! A great game, that"
[ID: 15] "It is not just the best of the series but also one of the greatest of all time. A truly magical experience that will stay with you forever. It has everything you could ask for in a game - epic storyline, breathtaking visuals, excellent gameplay mechanics and immersive world. I would recommend it to everyone who loves games, especially those who enjoyed its predecessors. Elden Ring is an amazing masterpiece that you must play if you have any interest at all in this genre. This game will make you forget about your problems, relax and let yourself go! You'll become a legendary hero! [Spoiler] The ending leaves something to be desired... but trust me, you won"
[ID: 16] "I’ve played Elden Ring since it was released. I’m still playing it now and that’s saying something because when you start this game there isn’t much more than just “You can choose your own path in this story” at first glance. Now after years of play time it has turned into one of my favorite games ever! The art style is stunning with a ton of detail in every aspect of the world. The music is incredible as well! It’s all about immersion and making sure you don’t get lost in your journey! If you haven’t played this game already give it a try and enjoy! Go back through some old saves and have fun!! Can you summarize the gameplay and setting of Eldern Ring according"
[ID: 17] "This game is so boring and repetitive it's unreal. I hate every aspect of this game. The story is so bad they could have made a movie about it for $8 million. They even killed off all my favorite characters. And the music is awful. I can't believe I spent over 70 hours in this game without ever feeling like I was playing anything else. Stop making games like this! It's not fun anymore.' P.S. This game should be removed from steam right now. ' Hope that helps."
[ID: 18] "This is my second play through of this game and it still gives me that same feeling like when I first played it years ago. The storyline, characters, the world are just amazing and they all grow on you as time goes by. There are many hours spent in Elden ring but every time i go back and explore more there is always something new to find or discover. I love the way the graphics are able to take you to a different time period where magic exists and so do many unique creatures. If you have not played this game then do yourself a favor and get this game its worth every penny! The soundtrack also makes you feel like you have been transported to another place and time. Great game if you want to immerse your self into an experience"
[ID: 19] "Elden Ring is an excellent game, but there are some things that make it better than others. One of those things is how well the combat works, from its basic attacks to the more complex special moves. It's not just about dodging blows, but also figuring out when to use specific spells or abilities. In Elden Lotus, you have two different types of weaponry: your main weapon and a special attack, which can be used at any time with no penalty if you have a high enough level. That makes it really satisfying when you get a good combo going and end up having an awesome combination. Another thing I enjoy about this game is the world design. There are so many hidden secrets to discover, from hidden areas"
[ID: 20] "This is one of my favorite games I've played in years. The storyline and gameplay are top notch. It has everything that you could ask for in an epic action game and even more. Great graphics, sound effects, music, and characters. This game is the real deal! If you haven't played this game yet then you're missing out on one of the greatest gaming experiences ever created! This game will take your breath away at first play but as time goes by you will find yourself loving it all over again and all the way up the depths. Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games with good stories, great characters and solid combat systems. Play this game today! I am going back to play it now! Just be"
[ID: 21] "This is the first time I've played Elden Ring. But as soon as I start playing this game, I just know that it will be one of my most favorite games ever. The art style, storyline, combat system, everything about it is just incredible. It's like if you were playing one of those old RPGs from the NES era but with better graphics and more content. And to top it off, there's also a great soundtrack! A must play if you enjoy anime or manga! Highly recommended! 🚀✨✯️ #EldenRing #AnimeGaming #MechaFantasy #SwordandShield #RoleplayingGame #Play"
[ID: 22] "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released in 2011, and it was a huge success among fans of the series. The sequel is Elden Ring which came out in 19 years later on March 6th, 2108. This article will give you all the details about this game. Elden ring has a lot of things that make it stand out from its predecessor. Apart from the fact that it's an action roleplaying video game, it has some unique features such as a combat system where your character can learn new skills through mastering different weapons and armor. It also has a narrative that focuses more on the protagonist's personal life rather than the game"
[ID: 23] "The art in this game is just amazing! The characters, the world, everything. I love how they added that bit of realism where you can't see what people are doing but their emotions can be felt. It's like watching a movie or reading a book and feeling every emotion of those characters. This game also has some of the best music ever created, with beautiful sound effects too. Everything about it is top notch, from graphics to story to gameplay. If you have never played this game before, don't hesitate to pick it up. This is one of my favorite games ever. Can you summarize the review for Elden Ring?"
[ID: 24] "I played this last weekend and was blown away by the graphics and story. The characters feel like they're alive, even the nonplayable ones. I am so happy to see that it has been fully remade and not just an updated version. Can't wait to play more! PS: If you ever get the chance, go out and buy the other two games in the series. They were also incredible, but this one is truly special. It will be hard to find another game with such beautiful art direction, immersive worlds, and intricate character development. A must play."
[ID: 25] "Elden Ring is a masterpiece of design, it has so much depth in its story that you will lose yourself in it. The world is vast and filled with all kinds of creatures and beings from different realms. This creates a feeling of being lost within this fantastical universe. It's not just the characters either, the soundtrack is one of the most immersive ever created. It makes every moment feel special and important. The combat mechanics are also very satisfying, the enemies are well designed, challenging but fair. I have never felt more engaged with an action role playing game before. Overall, ELDEN ROW IS A MASTERPIECE OF DESIGN AND GAMEPLAY. THERE IS NOTHING"
[ID: 26] "Its all about the story in Elden Ring, I don't mind if you have played any other game in this series or not but the stories is what kept me playing through out the years. The world of Eldin ring has so much more depth than the others that have come before it. Its not just another souls clone with gorey graphics and a new protagonist every few hours like most games today, its also has an epic storyline with enough variety to keep you entertained for ages. With my favourite character being your main hero who can be picked up at random during the daytime in order to pick them back up later on at night when you go to sleep. It adds to the longevity of the game because you always know"
[ID: 27] "I was hesitant at first but I'm glad I tried it out. It feels like an RPG with no quests to complete or anything like that. Its own world though is still very immersive and has its own unique storyline which you can get stuck in if you want to play through again. The combat mechanics feel good as well but not like any other RPGs. There are some bugs but I guess they will be fixed eventually. The graphics look alright too, maybe a bit bland compared to others but its also something that can be easily ignored since you're doing something else while playing this anyway. For me personally, I don't really care about any of those things because I enjoy being a warrior, getting the best weapons from all"
[ID: 28] "I got this game as soon as I heard it was coming out and I was looking forward to it but I'm not sure if it is worth all of that money. The game is massive and there isn't much content. Not really playing for hours on end like some people do with their games. But you can go back and replay the whole thing over and over again. It takes time though so don't expect it to be done in an hour or two either. I haven't played much of it yet but I think its worth every penny just from how epic everything looks. And the soundtrack is amazing. This game is so beautiful and epic and has some of the best music ever created for video gaming. Just wait until you get your"
[ID: 29] "Its not perfect but it's better than most of the games out there. I think they should release some more content but this game is already quite good so you can try to get everything. There's no way to complete it without playing it over multiple times. The story is great, the graphics are amazing as well. It's just a shame that Elden Ring was made by Nintendo and had such bad reception on its first day out. Its a classic now and will be forevermore. If you have any interest in gaming then check it out! Its worth your time! Gameplay: This game has a good balance between storyline and gameplay. I like how it allows me to explore and interact with the environment. The combat is also fun"
[ID: 30] "I don't understand what all these reviews say about Elden Ring. Is it because they have been playing a lot of games or is there something wrong with their mind? I mean, seriously... I was so excited for this game! But then when I got my first playtime in, it felt like an eternity and I didn't want to do anything but just sit still and wait for my enemies to attack me. That was one of the reasons why I bought this game. But after that first playthrough I just couldn't get into it anymore. It seems as if there has been some sort of bug or glitch where you can't move at all while you're wearing armor that makes you invincible and gives you an infinite health"
[ID: 31] "Elden Ring is a good game but I think there is more room for improvement in terms of storytelling. The main plot is not as engaging compared to other games like Dark Souls or Horizon Zero Dawn. The storyline is also quite vague and doesn't have enough details about the Elden Lore that makes it feel like a continuation of the story from the previous two games. There is no overworld map which leaves players wondering what's next after each area they visit. I'm hoping that the future updates will bring a proper overworld, where we can explore at our leisure and discover secrets within each region. The art style is great and the combat system is satisfying. It feels like a refinement of the previous"
[ID: 32] "This is the best game ever! I love this game so much!!! I can't stop playing it!!! Its an amazing game with a lot of depth and stories behind each characters!! The world is breathtakingly beautiful, the music is epic and the storyline is great! This game is truly unmatched in my opinion! It deserves all the awards and praises that come its way! I highly recommend it to everyone who loves games like minecraft or any other type of adventure game! A must play!!! The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and this game have some similarity with them, but it's something completely different and special. Even though Skyrim was released years ago, Elden Ring still stands out as one"
[ID: 33] "Elden Ring is an awesome game with a lot of content and really fun combat. The story mode is great but I would like more side quests to do. There's nothing wrong with it but I feel like there could be some more variety in the story mode. It has been over two years since its release and I have yet to see any new DLCs or updates. If you haven't played this game then you're missing out on something fantastic. Definitely worth playing for fans of the nintendo switch. Just don't expect anything majorly different from the original."
[ID: 34] "I've been playing Elden Ring since its release in March of this year, and I must say that it has been one hell of an experience so far. The story is really engaging, with multiple choices that impact the outcome, and the characters are truly memorable. This game is just as addicting as anything else out there. It's hard to put into words how much fun I have playing ELDEN RINGE. If you like JRPGs, then this game is definitely worth buying! It will be a while before this game becomes obsolete though. A few games can still hold their own. I would give it at least 5 stars but I do believe that at least once you get past the first act, you need to"
[ID: 35] "Simply put...if you like god of war or assassin creed then this is the best open world game you can play right now!! I have played every version of this game on ps4 and it is amazing! The graphics are outstanding but its the way they add so much depth to the characters that makes me love them even more! They truly feel alive and human!!! This game will be my go to when I need something great to play!! I am hooked!!!! I highly recommend this game!!!!!!!''' test_string = test_str print(repr(test_str)) ``` output: ```text '<bound method Repeater.__call__ at 0x7fc8c2f"
[ID: 36] "I've been waiting for this game for years now, and it didn't disappoint. Elden Ring is a beautifully crafted game with a fantastic storyline, great boss fights, and an excellent cast of characters. I highly recommend picking up this game if you have even just the slightest interest in roleplaying games or horror. I can't wait to see what comes next from Bandai Namco Entertainment. 💜🤡😍👀🔥❤️"
[ID: 37] "Wow, what a masterpiece! This is my favorite game ever. The world is so immersive and mysterious with all its secrets. The battles were intense, the graphics are just mind blowing. There's so much to do in this game, you can explore everything and never get bored. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves action roleplay games or adventure games. Just go play this game now! You won't regret it. Honestly, I don't even know how to describe this game without making it sound too good. It's like nothing else out there right now. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys gaming. It truly is an exceptional work of art. Thank"
[ID: 38] "Elden Ring is an amazing game. The world of Elden ring is breathtakingly beautiful with stunning visuals that will blow you away. The combat system is also very satisfying and can be easily mastered. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves rpg games. However, as much as I love the story and characters, the gameplay is quite repetitive and can get boring after a while. Overall a great game but I feel like there could be more to it. I'm glad I got my money back though. Love it or hate it. It's up to you."
[ID: 39] "Love this game, I have played it all of its life time till now, still love the gameplay, characters, story, music and graphics... It's just amazing. And even if you don't like the game, there is so much more out there with many different stories, games etc.. It will keep you entertained forever, even when you stop playing, they have other games for you. If you loved this game then you probably love all the others in their genre. Keep up the great work guys!!! PS: 2020 release was awesome, new additions made the game more fun and exciting. I hope this game can continue being popular and enjoyable for years to come!! Got me hooked again"
[ID: 40] "This is an amazing game!! I have played it on PS4 and PC since launch!! The storyline is fantastic! The combat system is great and there are so many different types of characters that you can use! There are over 70 hours in this game, I've done everything and more! This game has taken my life in its hands! If you are looking for a beautifully crafted open world game with tons of content and unique stories then look no further than Elden Ring! Trust me!!! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves games like Dark Souls, Castlevania or any other game that has an intricate story line, an immersive world and lots of replay value! This is one of the best games I have"
[ID: 41] "This is one of my favorite games ever! I am not sure why people criticize this game but it's just what it is! I have played many games over time but nothing like Elden Ring. The story line is amazing and so is the world that you go through. It has all of the things that I love in a game plus more! The art style is so beautiful it really puts me in a different world with the music also. I think if you loved Zelda then you will love this game as well. Overall I give this game an A+++!!!!"
[ID: 42] "Its good , but if u have a lot of time to spend on games and you can’t find anything better then this game is not for you . Avoid it like the plague . If you love this game give it an hour and a half and you will see why its so great . A must play in my opinion . Only thing that can go wrong with this game are the stupid people who do all sorts of tricks. Like running out of food and just giving up or even worse than that just walk off the island without doing any work at all !!!!!! But other wise this game has everything to make you die laughing . The graphics look amazing especially when the lightning comes out . Boss fights are epic and challeng"
[ID: 43] "I've been playing Elden Ring for some time now and I must say that this is one of my favorite games ever made. The story is quite unique and it has something for everyone, from action and combat to exploration and crafting. But what really sets it apart is its beautiful graphics, immersive world, great soundtrack, and engaging storyline. It was the first time in many years where I didn't want to put down my controller. Eldorian's writing style and character development have me hooked on this series, and I can't wait to see how they continue to push boundaries with future titles. This is a masterpiece, one of the best games ever created."
[ID: 44] "I am on my second play through of Elden Ring so far and I'm loving every minute of it. The story is amazing, but the combat is the best part. Every enemy has their own unique attacks that can be learned at any time during the game. The boss fights are also top notch and some are even more challenging than others. If you enjoy action-packed games with deep lore, beautiful graphics, and an intriguing story, then this is your game! Can't wait for the future updates as they seem like they will add more depth to the world."
[ID: 45] "This is one of my favorite games so far! The story was fantastic, the combat was amazing and they really did an excellent job with the graphics and soundtrack. I am in love with this game. The only thing that could make it better is if there were more side quests but hey we all know how much they're going to have to cut from this game to fit everything else they want to add! So overall a masterpiece and I can't wait to see what other amazing things they will bring next. Great job everyone involved! +1 for awesome story, great combat system, beautiful art, incredible characters, amazing world, epic boss fights, fun coop modes, unbeatable multiplayer, great solo"
[ID: 46] "This is not a traditional story or any kind of plot, but it's about your character evolving from being a mere hunter, to something more profound and dangerous. The world itself is so immersive that you start to feel like you have lived here yourself in this time, even though you are just playing as someone else's game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action RPG games with great characters, beautiful graphics, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals. I am looking forward to seeing what other amazing surprises this world has waiting for me. This game should be one of the best games ever made!"
[ID: 47] "I loved this game as soon as I started playing it, I am so glad that I purchased it and got all of my rewards too. The story is amazing, the characters feel like you know them personally. The music in the game is also fantastic and really adds to the experience. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves an open world RPG with great combat. The graphics look better than any other rpg ever made and the physics of the character movements are incredible! This game truly does have everything a gamer could ask for. It has a huge amount of content, from main quest missions, side quests, collectibles, side stories, and much more. I could go on forever about how good this game is but I'll"
[ID: 48] "Honestly not sure if I would even play this again. Just felt like a really long chore with no reward at all. If you're in the mood for something that requires some thought and time then this is an interesting challenge. But don't come here expecting hours of fun or anything worth playing. It feels like a hassle. Too bad because I have no interest in Elder Scrolls anymore, but this could have been a lot worse. Wish I had never played it. I agree with the previous reviewer, too. The difficulty curve is just ridiculous. A good 6hr into the story, and still trying to figure out which way to go when it was clearly right. This game takes forever to learn the bas"
[ID: 49] "The first thing that strikes you about Elden Ring is its stunning visuals, which consistently impress even after multiple plays through the game. The art direction and animations are top notch, with everything from character design to cinematics being absolutely breathtaking in their quality. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard since the PS3 era, with so many different genres represented that it truly feels like you're listening to music from the time period it was made. But what really makes this game stand out among other open world games is the depth of the story. It's a bit of an old-school RPG, but there's still a lot of lore to explore, and characters with real personality to develop"
[ID: 50] "I bought this game at release day because I was excited about it and I'm glad I did. It's really good but I think if you play it without a lot of expectations, like I do, you won't be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants something in between Destiny and GW2, that has some fun action elements with character progression. Also a little bit more than what it says on the tin as well. So if you're looking for a game that has a mix of both then this is the one for you. The story is interesting enough to keep you playing even though it's all cut scenes. The world itself is beautifully designed and full of detail. The combat is challenging and addict"
