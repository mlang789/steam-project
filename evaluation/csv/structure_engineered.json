"analysis": "The vast majority of reviews failed to meet the strict '2 Positive / 1 Negative' constraint. Most failed reviews were heavily skewed towards negative sentiment (often listing 3+ negative points) or positive sentiment (3+ positive points) without adhering to the count. Many reviews also combined multiple points into single sentences or failed to articulate distinct arguments. Only reviews ID 12 and ID 16 successfully isolated exactly two positive attributes (e.g., graphics and framerate) and one negative attribute (e.g., storyline)."

"analysis": "Every single review failed to meet the strict '2 Positive / 1 Negative' constraint. The most common error was providing an exclusively positive review (0 negatives), often ending abruptly or listing 3+ positive aspects. Reviews that did include negatives often failed the count ratios (e.g., 1 Pos/2 Neg, 2 Pos/2 Neg) or provided general summaries rather than distinct arguments."
