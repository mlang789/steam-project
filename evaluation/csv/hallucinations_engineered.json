  "analysis": "Many reviews hallucinate non-existent classes (Captain, Tank, Meatbot, Grunt, Vault Hunter, Supportist) or specific named characters (Captain Hammer, Commander Cod, Wilson, Mitzy). Several reviews describe the game as an RPG with character creation, a Fantasy game with spells and archers, or an RTS involving unit deployment. Other errors include attributing the game to Epic Games, claiming a 2013 release date (confused with Dota 2), or describing mechanics like 'choosing spawn locations' and 'summoning comforts'."

  "analysis": "Many reviews hallucinate a 'Campaign Mode', 'Storyline', or 'Boss Fights', which do not exist in Counter-Strike (a competitive multiplayer shooter). Other hallucinations include fictional characters (Jack Ravenwood, Tracy McNeil), incorrect release years (2018, 2007, 1998 for CS2), claims of the game being Third-Person or having controls identical to Dota 2, and inventing developers (Black Shell Games) or mechanics (taking selfies, predetermined weapons based on level, grappling/throwing players)."
