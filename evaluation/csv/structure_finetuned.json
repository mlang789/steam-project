  "analysis": "The majority of reviews failed the strict '2 Positive / 1 Negative' constraint. Most non-compliant reviews were either overwhelmingly positive (containing 3+ positive points and no negatives) or entirely negative rants. A few reviews attempted a balanced structure but missed the exact count (e.g., 3 positives with 1 negative, or 1 positive with 2 negatives)."

  "analysis": "The majority of reviews failed to meet the strict '2 Positive / 1 Negative' constraint. Common errors included providing overwhelmingly positive feedback with no negative points (e.g., 'Best game ever', 'No complaints'), entirely negative rants, or mixed reviews that did not adhere to the specific count (e.g., 3 positives with 1 negative, or 1 positive with 2 negatives)."
