"analysis": "Despite the user's request to be lenient regarding Team Fortress Classic (TF1) overlaps, a large number of reviews are still hallucinations because they describe genres and mechanics that exist in neither TF1 nor TF2. Major hallucinations include describing the game as an RPG with 'Skill Points', 'Character Creation from scratch', and 'Leveling Up'; mentioning a 'Story Mode', 'Campaign', or 'Final Boss' (which TF2 lacks); and inventing classes/characters such as 'Vortigon', 'Enchantress', 'Ace', 'Captain', or characters from Overwatch ('Widowmaker'). Several reviews also hallucinated MOBA mechanics like 'Auto-attacks' and 'Towers' as core gameplay."

"analysis": "The reviews frequently hallucinated a 'Story Mode', 'Campaign', or 'Missions' involving the Cold War or specific plotlines, which Counter-Strike 2 does not have. Several reviews invented mechanics such as 'Dialogue Systems', 'Loot Boxes' affecting stats/rewards, 'Special Abilities', 'Gun Malfunctions', and a mechanic literally called 'counter-strikes'. There were instances of describing the wrong game (referencing 'Counter-Strike 4', 'Counter-Strike 1.6' as the current game, or 'Mobile' ports). Errors in release dates (e.g., 2016, 2025), developers (Gearbox, Boss Key), and genre (Action-Adventure) were also detected. Some reviews mentioned gameplay elements like 'picking up the ball', 'third-person camera issues', or 'faction-based matchmaking'."
