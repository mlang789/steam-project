The story is poorly written, no character development, nothing interesting about the world or gameplay. The graphics are also terrible compared to previous games by CD Projekt Red. Overall I would recommend to buy another game with higher price tag. There is no reason why you should spend $69.99 on this game when you can get a similar experience for around $20. It's not even worth the price tag of the game itself.
Just wait until Cyberpuner 2 comes out with better graphics and a lot more content. Then you will regret purchasing this game.",231,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,True

also I hate the gameplay, I dont even know how to use sword in this game! it`s such a shame that Elder Scrolls series has stopped making new games with their original characters!

The controls were very good but the overall gameplay was too easy and not challenging enough for me.

This is not a criticism of any other game, just that this is where it all started. And if you can enjoy it so much as an adult, then god damn you man!

If there were less of the same stuff that was offered over and over again, it would be better. But I think it's already too late. They should have kept the old mode and added new ones instead of making this game more predictable than it already is. It just gets boring and feels like the game has reached its peak.

It's safe to say that it feels like a lot more than its early access state. But that being said if you have played previous games from this franchise then you know what to expect.

But even without any opponent, this game can be challenging as well because sometimes when you try to pass or do damage at all times, your team has no chance against your opponent.

I remember when we used to play multiplayer a lot back then but unfortunately it seems like that's no longer the case lol.

It's hard to put into words how much fun this game is but suffice to say that once you get past the tutorial level, you won't want to stop playing it until completion. One of my favorite games ever!

The story is interesting enough, but the characters and their interactions with each other were what made this game so special. My biggest complaint is that some of the side missions are not fun enough or are too easy - you can easily finish them without much effort, which is disappointing. But overall, this game is amazing!

It's not just about being good at shooting people, but also about getting your weapons out and using them correctly, as well as keeping your health in check. There's always new ways to play the game, so you never feel bored or uninspired. Overall, Team Fortress II is one of the greatest experiences that gaming has to offer.",248,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
1245620,ELDEN RING,9,finetuned,"Elden Ring is an excellent game, but there are some things that make it better than others. One of those things is how well the combat works, from its basic attacks to the more complex special moves. It's not just about dodging blows, but also figuring out when to use specific spells or abilities. In Elden Lotus, you have two different types of weaponry: your main weapon and a special attack, which can be used at any time with no penalty if you have a high enough level. That makes it really satisfying when you get a good combo going and end up having an awesome combination.

The teamwork aspect is one of my favourite things about this game. Even when we get disconnected or go on vacation, our friends keep coming back and they will always be able to join us in any lobby.

But even though it might seem like an odd recommendation at first glance, I personally believe there is so much more depth and thought behind this game than what people think. It has something to offer for everyone, and no matter how much you do or don’t enjoy playing, you will always be able to see why it deserves all the love and respect it gets. And also, I hope your friends",276,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True

1245620,ELDEN RING,9,finetuned,"Wow, I didn't expect this game to be as good as it is. It has everything you could ask for in an open world with great graphics and fun combat. The story is good but don't go into it expecting anything more than that. If you love games like Assassins Creed then this will be your kind of thing. If not you probably won't enjoy this game too much because the combat can get repetitive after a while. But hey, who cares about that? Just play this game! This game is a must have on steam!

P.S. It's worth playing if you haven't played any other Elden Ring yet! You might not like some parts of the gameplay, but it's",278,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,False
440,Team Fortress 2,3,finetuned,"I've played TF2 for almost 9 years now, so I know it's been around for quite some time. And while I can understand why people like it and how much they love it, I don't see why anyone would keep playing after all this time. Why? Because of the one thing that is truly unchanging about the game since its release in 2007: the way that every single player feels utterly useless as soon as you start shooting at them. There is no way around it - when you're trying to play TF with your friends, everyone needs to be really good at something else besides fighting off enemy players. For me personally, it was just getting used to aiming without looking away from my screen every second or",279,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,True
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,9,finetuned,"This is an incredible game! The world of Cyberpunck 2K77 is beautifully rendered with amazing detail and lighting. The storyline, however, feels rushed and doesn't really engage me. I am hoping they add more content in the future as it seems like they left too much out of the base game. There are some great side missions that provide some unique challenges but most of them feel like filler, especially compared to the main storyline. If you are a fan of the series this is worth checking out, if not, then definitely pass on this one.",280,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
1245620,ELDEN RING,9,finetuned,"If you're looking for something to do with your time until release, Elden Ring is it. The story has been described as complex but enjoyable in an age where we demand simple narratives. If you've played any of From Software's other games, then this will be familiar territory. For me though, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. The combat is great, the lore is deep, and there's so many characters to keep track of that I felt like I had more to learn about them than my actual friends back home. It's not going to win any awards for graphics or sound design, but it's a satisfyingly good game nonetheless. The boss fights were the highlight of the experience for me",281,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
730,Counter-Strike 2,9,finetuned,"Wow this is some great gaming! I love how you can really play with different players! Also, it's so funny when you get kicked out of a match because your friend made a joke about being banned! Can't wait to see what other awesome games they have in store for us! Just saying...this game is amazing! I recommend everyone to buy it! And if you don't know anything about counter strike then just start playing! It's basically like the best multiplayer mode ever! The way that every player has their own unique style and approach to the game makes it an endless source of entertainment! I hope you enjoy it as much as me!",282,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,9,finetuned,"This is an amazing game! It's like a dream come true. I love how it's full of everything that made CDPR famous, but also has its own unique flavor. The story is great, the graphics are stunning, the music is great and the art direction is fantastic. Everything about this game is perfect, so much fun to play through. If you haven't played yet, go ahead and do so, you won't regret it! The world building here is amazing, so many things to discover and find. Also, the soundtrack is just phenomenal! Just finished playing the game again last night and wanted to check back in and see if anyone else felt like doing it. They did not disappoint me either. A must buy!",283,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
570,Dota 2,9,finetuned,"Great game! Just enough strategic depth to keep things interesting but not overwhelmingly complex that it's impossible to pick up after hours of playing. I've never had any issues with lag or connection problems while enjoying this game. Great job guys.

1245620,ELDEN RING,9,finetuned,"The Elden Ring is one of the most unique and memorable games I have ever played. The story and characters are incredibly intriguing, as well as the way they blend together in a nonlinear narrative. One of my favorite aspects about this game is how you can interact with other players online through the multiplayer mode, which adds an extra layer of depth to the experience. While not perfect, this game has left me wanting more since launch. The DLC expansions will keep me coming back for many years to come!

Gameplay:
Overall, the gameplay feels solid but there is some grinding required to progress further into the main campaign. There's also a lot of optional side quests that could take up hours if you",285,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,9,finetuned,"I've played through this game twice now, once on PS3 and once on PC with all options enabled. The story is quite good, it keeps you engaged from start to finish, but the main characters feel like cardboard cutouts. The world itself is incredible and so well designed that I can see myself playing for years to come. I'm hoping they keep adding new content to this world over time as well as continue to develop the story further. This game has been a revelation for me after playing other games where the entire world was unrewarding to explore without being constantly bored by monotonous repetition. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs or wants to try out a more open world experience. It's got everything",286,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,9,finetuned,"This game is like nothing I've ever played before. It has me hooked from start to finish with its open world structure. The game is incredibly deep, but also very accessible. And you can play it on PC as well! What more could you ask for?
I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an exciting new RPG. The graphics are outstanding, the storyline is intense, and the characters are all unique in their own way. This game really does have something for everyone, no matter what your preferences are.
It truly feels like a whole new gaming experience compared to anything else that's come out so far. The art style is stunning, and it never gets old. I couldn't put it down until it",287,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True
440,Team Fortress 2,9,finetuned,"i have been playing teamfortress2 since like april of last year. Ive always played it with my brother but I’ve never really gotten into it until recently when my brother has been getting me started on team fortunes again. Its just as addicting as i remember. And man its so much fun. I wish there were more modes though. But other than that, great game! Keep up the good work.

The graphics and music are simply amazing, every time when I play this game I feel like I am in a different world. The storyline is great, the characters are really well developed, the gameplay itself is super funny. Incredible graphics, great sound, and an awesome atmosphere makes Elden Ring unforgettable experience. If you want to try something new - this is your game! Highly recommended.

1245620,ELDEN RING,3,finetuned,"This is not a good game. I feel like it was made by an unprofessional person who wanted to make money off of games that people will love or at least enjoy. They have a fan base and a loyal following but what is this game? Its just a bunch of dumb people that want to kill other dumb players and get their own achievements.
The graphics look great for the most part. The story looks bad as well. There are so many cutscenes with no dialogue that its like you're watching some random video with some dialogue in between scenes. I think they could have done something more interesting with the story. I mean let me say this. If you play Elden Ring, then you have played Dark Souls before. That'",290,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,True
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,9,finetuned,"this is one of the best games ever made in my opinion, great graphics, great storyline and amazing soundtrack, but there's something that keeps me from giving this game a full five stars, which is just so sad. I understand that cyberpunck 2k77 was released many years ago, but it still feels like a fresh start, even though some things haven't changed too much since then, like the art style and setting. The whole new world you can explore and live your life without any limits or consequences just feel way too cliched at this point. But hey, maybe that's what the developers were going for. Also, I really hope they release more content soon, as I want to see how everything plays out over",291,POSITIVE,NEGATIVE,False
570,Dota 2,3,finetuned,"No more Dota, this game is the same as last year. The graphics are bad as hell, the lobby is full of idiots who don't know how to play, the ai is terrible. This game has no replay value, it's just like playing against the same bot over and over again. I can't recommend this game anymore. It's not worth my time or money.
Bugfixes? Come on man, you can do better than that! Stop being so cheap and stupid.
If you really want this game go buy another game, there's much better options out there.
Seriously man, stop wasting your time and money on this trash and focus on something better.

This game has been released almost 6 years ago so its definitely worth playing if you love open world games with great graphics and deep storyline. The gameplay mechanics are also quite impressive as well as the character customization options. Overall this game is a must play if you enjoy gaming.
Good luck and have fun!

It's a great game for killing time while waiting for something else to come up on steam! If you want some fun you might as well give it a try!

The game is very addictive so make sure you get enough sleep or eat properly though, it will ruin your life if you play too much! I have not played any other games like this before and I enjoy it greatly!",295,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True

I'm sure if they had made this game for free people would still be playing it since it has a lot of replay value..

But all in all great game just give me a refund....

Even though I bought it I won't spend another penny on this game again because I am not getting any more fun out of it than what was already there from free....
Besides even though I paid 25$ for the season pass I don't think I will ever spend 75$ on a single game again cause I just can't see how much I will get back",296,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,False

But seriously if you want to play with friends, there are plenty of ways to get that done through online multiplayer. It might be more difficult but there are always people willing to play on their own servers too.
I don't know why they took away the ability to have 2 player coop mode though.. That would be the best way to play this game with your friend(s). Just bring them over and start playing together like we used to.",297,POSITIVE,POSITIVE,True

There is nothing else here that makes it worth playing just for the loot boxes alone. The game itself isn't too bad if you don't mind the endless grinding and the fact that there aren't many unique heroes. There are still plenty of games out there with more unique characters. However, if you're willing to put in the time to get past the grind then DOTW can be an interesting experience.

If you play through every mission at max skill level then you can beat it with 1 kill. But I know most people who want to play this will have played hours on end to get that far, so it'll take them months of time just to finish it. And then they won't even be playing it long enough to enjoy any of the side missions or story.
