"analysis": "The majority of reviews failed to adhere to the strict '2 Positive / 1 Negative' sentiment structure. A significant number of reviews were overwhelmingly negative, listing 3 or more negative points without any positives (e.g., ID 3, 4, 14, 15). Others attempted a mix but failed the exact count, often providing 2 Positives and 2 Negatives (ID 23, 40) or just a single general positive grouping followed by multiple complaints. Only four reviews (ID 10, 11, 12, 47) successfully isolated exactly two distinct positive attributes and one negative attribute."

"analysis": "The vast majority of reviews failed to adhere to the strict '2 Positive / 1 Negative' structure. Most reviews (e.g., ID 6, 13, 27) were overwhelmingly one-sided, offering either a list of purely positive traits (Graphics, Gameplay, Sound) or purely negative complaints without balancing points. Several reviews (e.g., ID 1, 2, 45) attempted to introduce a point at the end but were cut off due to length limits, resulting in incomplete arguments. Only 3 reviews (ID 38, 39, 44) successfully isolated two distinct positive attributes and one clear negative attribute."
